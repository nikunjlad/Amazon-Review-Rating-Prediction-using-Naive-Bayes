E. Hinrichsen II,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you own an earlier Paperwhite and it's still functional there is no compelling reason to buy the Gen 4 ""All-New"" Paperwhite ( Amazon misleadingly refers to this as ""10th Generation"". It's a 10th generation Kindle e-reader but only the 4th generation Paperwhite ) unless a limited degree of water resistance (not waterproof as they claim) is important to you or you want Bluetooth capability for Audiobooks. Neither of these are remotely important nor needed by me in an e-reader and Audiobooks are handled better by smaller, lighter and less power hungry devices. The additional storage is coals to Newcastle as Amazon's cloud can hold any overstorage needs an owner has. Personally, I don't know anyone who has ever run out of onboard storage on any Kindle, including the very first keyboard models, despite loading them with hundreds of books. The much touted, by Amazon, thinness and lightness of this edition is, in my opinion, overblown. Yes it is slightly thinner and slightly lighter but not paradigm changing. Also beware: the supplied micro USB cable packaged with mine will not fit into the device, maybe yours will. All in all I find it breathtakingly stupid and/or venal of Amazon to ship a device so poorly engineered and quality controlled as to not have a functional charging cable. I bought this Kindle solely to replace a Gen 3 whose battery was failing. Amazon took every other Paperwhite edition off the website and left no choice but this one at $10 more than the previous edition. It's a Kindle, it's fine, but it's no game changer. If you buy it thinking it is I think you'll be disappointed."
Sir Mike,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated Review on Oct 6, 2019:

After nearly a year of using it, I noticed that the issues I mentioned in the original review were largely negligible while reading. The pinhole near the corner was never bothersome because I'd have to remember to look very closely to see it. The battery can last for a long time during hibernation, even for many many weeks if not used. I also hardly remember to notice the uneven screen color temperature. The only thing that's still a bit inconvenient is the glare. When near a window I'd have to adjust my reading angle to avoid the glare. It's something hard to overcome with a digital device and it's not a big compromise for light-weight and convenience. Therefore please take my original review below with a grain of salt, I was nitpicking on a device that I had a lot of expectations for. I also decided to change the 3 stars to 4 stars.

Original review on Nov 12, 2018 (with updates on Jan 26, 2019):

I have owned a Kindle Paperwhite since 2014. I really liked that old one and gifted it away a while ago. Perhaps I have had too much expectation for this new 2018 version (waited for many months for the release), I felt quite disappointed with a few of its issues.

First I must be clear that I am a fan of e-books, and I think Kindle Paperwhite has always been a nice device, light, easy to use, easier on the eyes than an LCD screen, easy to look up words, etc. I also used a Kindle Oasis for a couple of days, I don't feel comfortable with the hard slick aluminum back, and its front lights are located on the sides, so the slight uneven light can be observed from left to right; while for Paperwhite with bottom lights, the unevenness is from top to bottom, meaning within each text line, the light is usually even, therefore less distracting to reading.

Here comes the new 2018 Paperwhite:

I like the screen is flat with the bezels now. However, both the first device I received and the subsequent replacement have a bright pinhole dot under the screen (see photos). It's like a piece of tiny defect or dust above the e-ink text and located in the light distribution layer (my guess). When the front light is adjusted to a high level, the dot becomes quite bright and distracting. I was surprised the second device had the same issue (just my luck or something else is going on here?), but because it's near the corner, I decided to live with it. This pinhole bright spot issue apparently can be found on the previous generations as well based on many reviews, I am just astonished Amazon hasn't fixed it.

Also, I don't know what happened with the charging cable, it took me a lot of effort to plug it into the device, and pull it out, it's like as if the connectors are not made well.
(Update Jan 26, 2019: the difficulty of plugging in the cable only occurred during the first couple of uses, it became normal and smooth later.)

Also, the screen feels easier to smudge than my old Paperwhite. The texts appear slightly blurrier where there are fingerprints.

Another issue is that the screen has a ton of reflection from bright windows or light sources (please see my photo, taken under an east-facing window in the afternoon). I don’t remember if it has always been like this or it’s because of the new screen update. Even with the window blinds shut, I had to tilt Kindle to certain angles to avoid the glare, albeit softer than on an LCD screen, still quite distracting. Under the same lighting, a real paperback has no reflection glare issues.

Furthermore, when front light is on and when external ambient light is somewhat dim, my replacement Kindle Paperwhite appears a bit yellower near the bottom, especially on the left side, it’s distracting but hopefully, I’ll get used to it. It’s like real paper books getting old and parts of pages turning yellow—I try to convince myself.

(Update Jan 26, 2019: other reviewers have mentioned issues with poor battery life. My experience is similar that if I don't use it for a few hours, even with WiFi turned on, the device will enter something like a hibernation mode, which requires a bit more time to wake up, but it allows the battery to last for many weeks if left on the shelf. If I read about 1-2 hours a day with wifi on, the battery drains very quickly, and will hardly last beyond a week. However, If you keep airplane mode on during reading, it will significantly conserve battery, the only inconvenience is that if you don't know a word and the dictionary also doesn't have it, which is quite likely the case, Wikipedia won't be able to show up without WiFi.)

Perhaps I’m just asking too much for a digital device. Overall, it’s still a great device to read books, and Amazon still provided a fast replacement when I asked. However, with these experiences, I can no longer swear to e-readers. I don’t write reviews often, but I feel strongly about this product and sincerely hope it will help fellow costumers and help Amazon improve their devices."
Ship210,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Kindle, have always had one since the first edition. This is my third PaperWhite version of the Kindle. The battery life is non-existent. If you leave the WiFi option on, it drains the battery life within 9-10 hours even if you are not using the device. If you disable the WiFi, the battery life lasts a bit longer (approx 3-days) using the device 2-3 hours a day. The low rating is because of the very low battery life and inability to keep WiFi on all the time. Otherwise, my Kindle is my best friend. I most likely will return it because of the lack of battery longevity."
Rustic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I feel I need to approach this review from 2 perspectives:
1. If you are somewhat new to the Kindle experience and you bought this one.
2. If you are a previous Kindle or Paperwhite owner and upgraded to this one.

If you are NEW TO THE EXPERIENCE or upgrading from an old Kindle like a Keyboard, welcome. This new Kindle merits 5 stars. You're going to love it. Here are some Kindle Paperwhite features you'll enjoy:
* Built in light. Reading in bed while someone is trying to sleep next to you is now an easy joy.
* Touch screen. Getting around your Kindle is easy. Turn pages, shop in the store, all by touching the screen.
* Waterproof. This is a new feature to this Kindle. Bring it in the pool worry free!
* Bluetooth. Sync this up with a speaker or headphones to have a book read to you.

Besides that, this Kindle is thin and light. It doesn't fatigue your hand at all. The fonts are adjustable for size. The light is adjustable for brightness. The color of the light is somewhat grayish. My older Paperwhite had the blueish hue which I found a little unnatural. I bought the Amazon case and when you close the cover the Kindle automatically sleeps and when you open the cover it automatically wakes up. I find this Kindle to be a little faster than the previous version. If this is your first Paperwhite there is only reason to be content with your purchase.

Now, if you are UPGRADING FROM AN OLDER PAPERWHITE I'd still be happy (I'm still glad I did upgrade) but there were a few things that made me go hmmmm.

First off I expected this Kindle to have the latest software. It didn't. I'm waiting for the update where the home page scrolls and you could save font themes. Why doesn't a brand new Kindle not have the latest software? Not a deal breaker because I know the update will be coming, but my old Paperwhite was updated. Last time I checked the update page it didn't even show the update for this version. A little disappointing.

Secondly, I had the Paperwhite from a few versions ago, the one with 212 ppi. Upgrading to this one with 300 ppi, I expected the font to be sharp, bold, and clear. Well, I'll just say that it didn't stink. Actually I found it to be a little greyed out, a little washed out to say it another way. Now, this is totally adjustable of course. The font could be bolded and size changed. But again, a little disappointed.

The software is exactly the same as my older version, minus the upgrade of course. I wish Amazon would give us more fonts to choose from. I know that we could download fonts now but it would just be nice if they were built in to begin with.

So my two biggest gripes are not shipped with the latest software and underwhelming font sharpness. From this perspective I'd give it a 3 1/2 or 4 star rating.

But having said that I have no regrets upgrading at all. I would do it again. The Paperwhite experience in general is something I find amazing. When I'm finished with a book I go right to the store and check out samples, download free classics, or pull the trigger on a purchase based on my mood right then and there. I wouldn't trade it for anything.

If you are new to Kindle or upgrading from a really old one don't let my gripes deter you. The Paperwhite is the gold standard of e-readers. At an affordable price you're getting this gold standard. And since this Kindle boasts being waterproof, bluetooth, being thinner and lighter, and with 8gb of storage, it's a no brainer."
D. Bier,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s infuriating that Amazon went to market with this machine. Do not upgrade from prior Paperwhites.

1. To unlock the device, it goes through a long “waking up” period where the backlight is turned up full blast for some reason. It then reverts to your normal backlight setting after unlocking. I blind myself every night reading in bed. All previous Paperwhites unlocked instantly, with no dumb backlight. After you lock it, it will unlock instantly again for a few minutes afterward, so it seems to be “going to sleep” in some deeper way — probably to save battery life.
2. It is not significantly lighter, but it is just SLIGHTLY smaller so that it doesn’t fit in the old Paperwhite cases. They obviously did this just to force you to buy a new case. Even worse, there are hardly any cases that fit this design—even from Amazon.
3. The battery life is bad, possibly because of the Bluetooth connection. You can turn it off in the settings menu with the WiFi, but it’s disappointing that they only added a feature by making battery life worse AND adding that stupid “waking up” process.

Pros:
Yes, it’s waterproof—although I mainly go it to stop dog hair being caught in the screen edges. The Bluetooth feature for audible does work, although it’s not better in any way than using your phone.
It seems to have more precise control over the backlight brightness... after it wakes up and blinds you.

Bottom line: this is not a finished product, and they shoved it out the door because they wanted to have it out for Christmas."
Truth Seeker,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After almost 4 years what do we get? Nothing of practical use. Is 8gb of storage really necessary? Of course not, unless you have 10,000 side-loaded books that will take you 20 years to read. Waterproof? After 10 years of owning Kindles I’ve never needed it. So unless you’re Michael Phelps or love to read underwater with goggles on its not necessary. Bluetooth? Does a real book have bluetooth? Worse yet, there is no immersive reading so it’s pointless....
Why is this the the worst Paperwhite yet?
It feels flimsy and hollow. It still has the same design as the original Paperwhite, you know the one released back in 2012 which makes it 6 years old. It still has the same Dinosaur bezels and now attracts more reflection, smudges and fingerprints than ever before. There is so much glare on this thing my girlfriend uses it to put make-up on. No but seriously a more appropriate name would have been the ""Kindle Refection"" or the ""Kindle Pinhole"" due to going through three different exchanges due to pinholes and dead pixels. It's sad. In my opinion, the previous Paperwhite 3 is better with the paper-like feel of the screen, it also has no glare and much better contrast and clarity. The new Paperwhite suffers from this as well as the dull and uneven lighting as seen in the picture. It also feels cheaply made and you can tell Amazon cut corners in assembly. As an example, the Voyage is also lighter but feels sturdy and solid in the hand whereas the new Paperwhite feels empty. Needless to say this new release is a major disappointment, but thats what happens when Amazon has no competition, the customer is the one to suffer. We all lose. Amazon is not innovating, they are not doing anything to improve the Kindle in practical ways that matter. More storage, waterproof and bluetooth are all gimmicks that the 99.9% of us don’t need. Its all a marketing scam.
What would have been nice is page turn buttons, less monstrous bezels, less glare, and Comfort light (the adjustment of color temperature for nighttime reading). Even the Glowlight 3 has it, and it’s 2 year old technology. Side by side this Paperwhite is worst in every way that matters next to my Paperwhite 3. I'm just disgusted with Amazon right now for slacking and making us wait so long for a mediocre device. Lastly, what is up with the White Logo? Talk about distracting! Amazon went black on black with the Paperwhite 3 to avoid distractions and allow for a more immersive reading experience. To go back to a white distracting logo makes absolute no sense. Why Amazon? Here is a side by side picture of the new Paperwhite 4 which should be adequately named (on the left) and the superior Paperwhite 3 (on the right). The choice is clear."
Modern Xena,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth Kindle. I started with the classic, moved to the one with a keyboard, and then the Paperwhite, and now the Paperwhite 2.0. I've now had it for five days. When I got it, I fully charged it.

I haven't tested this in water, so the only thing I can put in the pros column is the increased storage. Otherwise, it seems exactly the same as the original Paperwhite. I don't want to return the device because I can work around the issues, but I also don't want to give it a great rating given the issues I've seen so far - hence the three stars.

**Issues I had with the original Paperwhite that persist with this version:**

1. Occasionally unresponsive screen. When pressing to go forward or back, the device will sometimes freeze for a second before performing the required command. Based on other reviews, I can only assume this is a device issue. I was hoping it would be fixed with this version, but apparently not.

2. Battery doesn't meet marketing claims. I'll be clear upfront: I read a lot, and I read fast. I average three to five books a week, depending on the length of the book. 30% of my reading is done on my phone via Kindle app, and the other 70% is done on my Kindle.

Amazon claims ""battery lasts weeks."" If you don't use the device, that may be true. If you do, though, I'd say it lasts about a week. In the five days I've had this device, I've spent about twenty hours reading on it. The battery is half gone, so I assume its full life is 40 hours. Not bad - if the marketing claim said that the battery lasts a week (singular). Again, not enough to make me return the device, but it's annoying - especially given the increased price.

**Issues I had with the original Paperwhite that I haven't experienced with this version:**

1. Struggling to open large documents or books and occasionally crashing and freezing when getting too far into the document.

2. Slowing down when more books were downloaded. It performed best when only 8-10 books were downloaded on the device at a time and the others were cleared out.

3. Fully charged battery running out after six consecutive hours of reading, requiring a recharge (annoying, given the ""weeks"" statement when it didn't even last a day).

I'll update this review later to confirm if these last issues are resolved with this new version or if they crop up after more use."
Sherrie Thurman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an avid reader and adore the new paperwhite! To me, it’s the perfect reader. No light bleed thru, easy to control the amount of backlight, easy to download books and simply just easy to read my books. It did not come with the very latest software uploaded but within 24 hours of being connected to my WiFi, the kindle updated itself. Honestly, I’ve never purchased a smart phone that didn’t need an update within minutes of activation...Android or Apple.
Using overdrive on my phone or tablet, it’s easy to borrow books and return books from my library. The newest update allows you to return right from your paperwhite and that is a huge improvement. As a prime member, I get a free book every month plus I follow several emails that alert to free or greatly discounted books. 8 GB of storage is way more than enough for me. I find the weight to be significantly less than a paperback even with a case. I am happy with this purchase!"
J. Campbell,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a kindle since they originally cost $359.
I still have a keyboard kindle that works but has no light feature.
I have purchased three paperwhite at discounts as they stop working. I now
Have the new 10th generation. It is horrible. No improvement in looks
Ir function that I can visually see. It may have better storage, but that has never been an issue for me
as I remove the books I have read. I fully charged my new kindle using the charger
Provided. Cheap chargers dont work on this new version. It said 100% at 9:15 am.
After reading approximately 1 hour it is down to 90%. I have to recharge every 3rd day.
What happened to the weeks without a charge feature? All of my previous replacements
have been battery related as well. I may have to see how other readers are doing as this has
become a pattern with Amazon, not a fluke.
Addendum
I have now had the new paperwhite for a couple of months, so new issues are pages turn when you hold the kindle along the edges. Hard to read when you tap a page to turn forward and the slight twitch of a finger along the edge backs up a page. *Update* less than 6 months later. Have to go back to my old kindle. This one will no longer hold a charge."
Z.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My Kindle Voyage developed pinhole light bleeding so I decided to trade it in for $50 and a discount on a new Kindle. First, I bought the Oasis - what a total disappointment! High price and yet awkward to hold, awkward dimensions, horrendous battery life (mere hours), slow to boot up and lousy cover options. Back it went. I wasn't about to shell out a premium price for the exact same (old) Voyage tech and the Paperwhite was too big a downgrade (and ALSO long in tooth), so I held off on choosing a replacement. I was very disappointed when all they came out with is this new Paperwhite, but I got it anyway. At this point I'll stick with it, but if I could go back, I'd get a Kobo.

This newest Paperwhite is ""meh."" It's OK. But it's only OK. No night mode like the Kobo. Light, but too small and very cheap feeling. Case is the same overly expensive price, but feels and looks cheaper than the older Paperwhite cases (Hubby still has his 2nd Gen Paperwhite) - they even omitted the little silver tag on the cover, which jazzed it up a bit. Like the Oasis, the newest Kindle Paperwhite takes several seconds to turn on - it's bad enough even my husband commented on it when we compared devices. What on earth are they doing to make these SLOWER than old models? How do they think people will find this acceptable? My Surface Pro 4 runs an actual Windows 10 operating system and it boots at least as fast - faster than the Oasis. Yes, the new Paperwhite is waterproof, but I've never NEEDED waterproofing, so I don't really care. Backlight is OK but nothing special. Screen is the same old epaper screen.

The new Paperwhite isn't truly bad and it's definitely not great...it's just ""OK"". It's DEFINITELY preferable to the Oasis. If you aren't committed to the Amazon ecosystem for books, I'd suggest you check out Kobo or some other ereader brand, instead. Amazon seems to be really missing the mark with their ereaders these days and it's truly disappointing."
Greta,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My first unit was dysfunctional out of the box (repeated charging problems — wouldn’t charge when plugged in and then after the reset, drained almost immediately while on sleep/without active use and ultimately turned out to be slower than the new one), which took some pushiness on my part to get replaced. Amazon did follow up afterwards which I appreciate the original unit ended up being sent to their engineering department, which suggests a concern with quality control. And my new unit is wonderful. It is replacing a 2014 paperwhite. I really wanted and like the water resistant aspect. It’s nice to read in the bathtub without a ziplock bag or a worry about an accident. I also like the extra memory and being able to Bluetooth connect to headphones. Once you have downloaded an audible book to go with a kindle version, you can’t delete the audible without also deleting the kindle (and then redownloading the latterif you want), at least as far as I have been able to figure out. It feels lighter than my old one (which may be a difference in cases — I ordered the water-resistant fabric one of from Amazon and my old one had a leather case). The front is completely flush — no bevel down to the screen, so it feels more like a paper book in that way. I find the unit to be very responsive except for menu items — then it is slow to recognize the tap and if I tap again I end up getting two or three menus appearing over one another when they do show up. Other than that, all the wonderful aspects of the old paperwhite + the new features."
Richard F. Keller,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only had it a week, obviously but love it so far. It is lighter and slightly smaller. It fits well in my hand and I love it and it is my 6th kindle so I have some experience with them."
Laurie M. Salazar,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My Paperwhite arrived and I couldn’t wait to try it. I took it out of the box, registered it and started to read. During the day I felt the light was very dim, even when tuned up to maximum. So I decided I’d wait until night time and try it then. It was still WAY too dim. I called the next day to try and get some tech support and after an hour long, wasted phone call in which I got no help, I decided to send it back. I’m afraid to order another one, because if the light is still too dark, it won’t work for me. It was darker than the light on my old Kindle, my iPhone, my iPad mini and my MacBook."
William,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I used the first gen of paperwhite
Upgrade to the new one
Compare these two
Old one's font is much better for reading
The new paperwhite' s font just look not solid"
Patsy Hennessey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this as a Birthday present from my husband.

This Kindle is lighter and thinner than the last generation, noticeably so. The flat edge to edge screen is an improvement in feel and makes it much easier to clean. It still has an excellent non-glare screen that I love for reading outdoors.

Mine is the 32G model, which is absolutely the best improvement for me, as my ebook library had outgrown my old Kindle's capacity, forcing me to remove parts of my library from it. It is a personal quirk, but I prefer to have my entire library available to me on my device.

I'm also very pleased by the addition of Audible capability, allowing me to combine my libraries into one device. Mine paired easily with my Yurbuds Bluetooth earbuds, allowing for comfortable listening.

As with my last Kindle, my reading experience is unbelievably enhanced. My eyesight is poor and reading small print triggers migraines. As I am able to choose a font and print size that works for me, the Kindle has meant that I can read as much as I like again.

The only fly in the ointment, and this does not change my love for this new generation Kindle, is that my wonderful, well made cover for last generation will not fit the new one, and the design and quality of the new covers just doesn't stand up to the old one."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointing. Charging cable didn't have the correct USB, can't use it. No option to turn it off. No way to add apps (games), or view E-mail. I'll use it when I'm near water. Otherwise, I'm keeping my old Kindle Fire and using that."
R. Price Blalock,2.0 out of 5 stars,Screen has a blue tint to it that was not present on the previous generation that makes reading in the dark feel like you are reading a laptop. The power switch is (again) akwardly positioned where you would rest your pinky except this time the amazon case does not inhibit you from constantly pressing the button. I was very excited to get the new model but reading in the dark at night is where I use my Kindle most and this generation is a downgrade for that purpose. Blue light screen does not dim as much as the previous generation and the case is lower quality.
AJR,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ""upgraded"" my previous paperwhite kindle to this one for the waterproof nature of the new model. That's great, but the new one has the power button on the bottom which is very easy to accidentally hit while you are holding the kindle and turn it off. The recessed button on the previous model was much better! Secondly, you are now forced to ""swipe to unlock kindle"" after you press the power button. It is a minor hassle to have to do that every time you want to use the kindle after you've already pressed the power button to turn it on. Again, the previous model where all you had to do was hit the power button was a better design. Come on Amazon, we've come to expect more than this from you!"
Yang Zhou,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Right after I purchased this Kindle I received a Welcome email from Amazon and I noted there is an additional message in the email that states ""We’ve heard from a small number of customers that they’re having trouble inserting the included USB cable into their device."" I didn't expect that would be me.
Guess what, I received my Kindle today and the USB won't go in at all! Very frustrated now! So I contacted the Amazon customer service and apparently the agent who answered my call was not aware of this apparently prevailing issue a lot of customers are experiencing!
Come on Amazon, this is my first Kindle ever and so far I am not happy with this huge design failure.

Update 20 days after purchase:
So I called the customer representative and they admitted that it is indeed a defect a lot of customers are having the same issue. Their solution is to give me a $10 voucher and purchase a spare USB cable which will fit. It turned out that the Kindle itself is fine. The cable, however, is defective. This solved my problem. However, I just really wished everything could be right the first time.

Updated today on Jan 01, 2020:

So this Kindle has been acting strangely for a whole year since my purchase. Whenever the battery is low, it will go to a complete grey screen mode with a battery warning symbol on it and every time I had to hold the power button for ten seconds to reboot the system in order to start the kindle. (Note: just charging it won't solve the problem, I have to charge and reboot every time). Now today, after I charged the kindle, the rebooting did not even start it. The unit is now completely dead to me with the battery warning symbol on the screen."
JET,1.0 out of 5 stars,"*****UPDATE******
So my replacement came today. And of course its not running the current software, its running the 5.10.0.1.
To introduce major hardware upgrades and not the latest software, and then expect customers to wait upwards of a month for a corresponding software update??? Why would Amazon think that is acceptable??
Anyway, both 10th generations are going back as soon as possible. I'll carry on with my 2015 model....

*****ORIGINAL REVIEW******
Why did I receive a brand spanking new high capacity, IPX8 rated 10th generation PaperWhite running the old 5.10.0.1 software?? After spending hours on the phone with 3 different CS reps, I now understand the current 5.10.1.2 software is not available to download, anywhere. No active Kindle content, no custom fonts, no scrolling home page, etc.
Amazon has agreed to send me another new 10th generation at no charge to make up for this little snafu however, I am not convinced the new 'new' device will have the current 5.10.1.2 software on it.
The last CS rep actually said she didn't understand what the problem was since the device still worked and downloaded books and I could buy and read on it. I had to explain to her that the software is what allows one to personalize the device and its this personalization that keeps Kindle owners coming back again and again. the IPX rating, the flush screen, the bluetooth / Audible features are great to have, but its the software that can make it yours.
And speaking of bluetooth, is it not time to re-introduce device music playback? I'm not sure why this feature was discontinued in the first place.
Amazon Kindle Paperwhite Development Team: bring back the simple MP3 player, Thank you very much...."
Honey's girl,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For me the most important thing was storage, battery life and it being water proof. Unfortunately battery life does not live up to the hype. Only a day or two for me. Granted, I read a lot but my old paper white lasts longer. Also hate the power button being on the bottom causing me to accidentally cut it off while reading."
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle was so interested in giving us the lightest, the thinnest, the smallest, etc, of the e-readers that they failed to focus on what is good about the kindle. The bottom of the kindle is thinner but the on/off button sticks out below the case and turns the Kindle off while resding. When I turned a page, the book would go back to the index (1%) and I would have to find out what part of the book I had completed before continuing with the book I was trying to enjoy. VERY annoying. And there were a couple of minor glitches too. It is going back."
Naima Dillard Thomas,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so excited to find out there was a new paperwhite with bluetooth capabilities for audible. I'm a serious reader and my job doesn't make way for me to actually ""read"" a book, so Audible allows me to work and get my book fix at the same time. That's the only reason why I bought this; my old paperwhite works just fine and the battery lasts forever!

Well, the new paperwhite is nice, it's a little lighter, but the old generation never bothered me in terms of weight and handiness. I like the extra storage and I especially like the audible feature. The reason why I'm giving this product 3 stars is the deplorable battery life. I charged it fully this morning (7:00am) and its halfway gone by 3:30pm. Not cool. Perhaps it's the new features, but Amazom advertises this Kindle as having just as much of a long battery life as its previous makes. I would have never purchased this if I knew the battery sucked; I would just listen using my phone. Too bad for me, I gave my old paperwhite away to a friend. Ironically, I was going to buy the oasis but stopped when so many customers complained that the battery was inferior, now I feel slightly cheated.

*update February 13, 2019:

I really wish I hadn't bought this device and just kept my old one. I originally purchased it for the Audible features but I don't use it; I'm too annoyed at the device disconnecting from my earphones if I leave the device paused. Honestly, of I'm at work and I pause Audible, within a minute my Kindle will disconnect from my earphones and I'll have to connect them. Annoying, especially considering my iPad or Android phone has never done this--i can paused something, walk way, come back and click ""play"" on my earphones and the book will resume. Not with this over priced ebook reader. It disconnects, so I'm forced to flip open the case, then I have to wait for it go through ""waking up."" Again, annoying. I purchased this for Audible; had I known this device was so inferior I would of kept my old paperwhite and continued to use the app with my phone. Honestly, my old paperwhite was my favorite piece of tech. To me, it was Amazon's perfect ebook reader. Sometimes simple is better.

It's sad because I dont really use this at all; when I'm at home and I can actually look at a book, I read from my phone or a physical copy because the screen is not like the original. The light isn't as soft as the old one.

I don't want to be wasteful, so I'm slowly but surely using it--I'm forcing myself to put it in my purse and read it during my lunch break or on my commute. Let's be honest, I'm probably just going to give this to my mother-in-law and buy the older one again--but I kind of like my mother-in-law so that might my cruel to give her a device that's not worth the money I spent on it.

Any pros? Its light, really unnoticeable in my purse or my hand. I'm a fan of the size and how flat and matte the screen feels. I can't speak personally on the storage because I haven't maxed it out, nor have I even maxed out the old one despite how many books I buy. I like the case, it's easy to remove so I can clean the device, yet it does a good job of protecting the paperwhite. I purchased the Amazon case so it was expensive, but at the time smaller companies hadn't come out with any knockoffs, so I'm sure there are better alternatives.

Unfortunately, I have to knock a star off of my original review. When I first reviewed this, I only had the device for a few short weeks. Now, after owning it for some time I feel better about my decision on giving it such a low rating. I used to be a ""book snob,"" look down my nose at electric devices. I blamed them for the reason Borders went out of business among other things. Then my physical library got too big and being a person that reads more than one book at a time, my purse started getting heavier. Then my grandmother bought me a cheap I-can't-remember-the-brand-name-to-save-my-life ebook reader and I loved it. So when that device died, I took the plunge and bought a paperwhite. And kept it for YEARS. I'm not even joking; the paperwhite I gave to my friend, I had for years. I had it for so long the case I originally bought for it just fell off one day. It was a composition style case and by the time it made it to the trash it turned into a gray case.

So, I wrote all that just to say, this is really disappointing Amazon. I know ebook readers are on the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to tech, but you had a product that performed greatly for what it was and for it's price. And I'm sure you had the money and the expertise to make this model even better, but you missed the mark for some reason. Shame."
Ali,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really surprised/impressed with how nice this new 2018 Kindle paperwhite was when it first arrived. When I first opened it I could tell it seemed longer, and maybe the wider bezel around it is for readers who prefer to read without a case, offering a better grip. Just guessing. I have both the Oasis, (both versions), and the Voyage, (a couple of them gifts and wonderful ereaders, I’ve thought), and I have loved them and still do, so I wasn’t expecting to really be impressed with this new ereader. I like to have an extra ereader or two so when my friends come to visit, we can all sit around and read if we want when we’re tired of going.

So a great surprise to see what a terrific ereader this is. Very lightweight , great flush screen, good adjustable back lighting, and just an easy tap to turn pages, and not even having to move your hand. Also there’s a good variety of cases to purchase and protect it. I prefer reading with a case on for a better grip for my smallish hands who are now home to some arthritis. I was able to find a great inexpensive case that fit well and has the sleep wake function. And now I see this as a wonderful option as a travel ereader too. It’s very thin, light, and compact, even in a case. I’ve had Amazon ereader’s since 2011, and have been impressed with most of them. But this one really impressed me since I haven’t had a Paperwhite version for awhile. Really with this version there’s not a lot of reason to upgrade to the Oasis. (Though I have to admit I love reading on my Oasis). But this is an easy to hold, very easy to see, easy to turn pages without moving your hand reader with great storage and, the opportunity of audible. What is not to love about it. Also the flush screen is a perfect upgrade. I read in bed the other night and the on/off button that another reviewer mentioned positioned at the bottom thought because of the placement , might turn the screen off, didn’t come into play at all, and then when the case came and I read in it again it seemed with the case there was no issue. It seems all Amazon has learned about producing ereaders came together with this 2018 Paperwhite. Really for me this is a five star product."
Kindle User,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The is no reason to upgrade. There are no additional features or user benefits. It is slightly lighter, but the screen is no brighter and there are no addition user controls or settings that represent an improvement."
stenUSMC,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Originally ordered two, one for me, one for my wife. After I got done charging mine, started the long, laborious process of downloading my library. (We live in an area without reliable WiFi, and large swathes of no cell or WiFi service, so we have to have the books on the Kindle...the 8G was a big plus...) Went to work. Eight hours later, my new Kindle, which had been off, was down to 45% on the charge. Tried again. Starting at 100%, after three hours of reading, was down to 52%. Contacted customer support for a replacement, as obviously the battery wasn't charging properly. Only had to go through three reps to get the return label...a personal achievement!

Notified the replacement had not been delivered (at a time my wife and I were both home) by the USPS. Reported it to them and Amazon. After four reps, got a replacement sent. It arrives with the one that was ""undeliverable"". Charged both. Batteries seem to be OK. Getting ready to contact Amazon to return one of them. Screen locks up. Software was not the latest version that was on my wife's (working) new Kindle. Tried the other one. Same; screen locks up when downloading a book, not the latest software. Both had to be force rebooted to unfreeze. Both locked up again. Again, had to force reboot to unfreeze.

Tired of having my life sucked out by defective products, contacted support to return two, and *maybe* try again. After going through eight reps, my patience was at an end, and went for the return and refund. This was the most unhelpful customer support I have ever experienced from Amazon.

I do not recommend purchasing the new Paperwhite Kindles until they work the bugs out, if at all. My older reader seems like it will have to do for the foreseeable future.

Edited to add: Had to return my wife's new Kindle paperwhite. Would not stay connected to the WiFi. Would not allow books to be shared from our family library. (Books showed up fine on her old Kindle, her phone, and her computer - just not the new one.) She's now stuck with her older Kindle.

All in all, a pretty unpleasant experience, Amazon. Now I'm waiting with bated (thanks Kaila - pokking autocorrect) breath to see how the refund process and credit for two older Kindles traded in for the new ones will go. (I'm guessing not well.)

2nd Edit - finally got the refund after going back and forth; seems they couldn't figure out their own order number system. Got nothing for the two Kindles I 'traded-in' for the new Kindle. (Don't really care if they are donating the Kindles to people who can use them...)"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a kindle user since they keyboard one came out back in 2009. Since then I have purchased 2 more kindles for me and 2 for my sister. I have never had any problems transferring my contents from Amazon to my new kindle. Yes I do have 900+, but as I've stated I have had a kindle for a long time. It only ever took an hour to transfer all content. This one to 6 DAYS!! That is with me sending them 4 at a time!! Over a broad band connection. Then I go to look for the games that I had purchased for my kindle, I could not find them. After questioning Amazon about this, Kindle games are not compatible with the new Kindle. WHAT???? Freaking ridiculous!! I have returned mine and I will keep my old one until it no longer works, and then I probably take my chances with a refurbished old one rather than go with this one."
Birgey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Paperwhite to me is the best bang for your buck in terms of an e-reader. It’s essentially the same as the previous Paperwhite, with a few new upgrades. The biggest and nicest change is the flush screen. That was the biggest selling point to me. In the previous Paperwhite, the screen kind of dipped into the device, thus every so often you’d get debris and what not in the sides of the screen. So you had to clean it off every so often. With the flush screen, it’s smooth like an iPad screen, surface wise. You still got the same screen quality as the other Paperwhites though.

The device is also water proof, which I guess that’s cool. But I don’t ever see myself being in a situation where I’m like “gotta get my kindle wet.” But I guess that’s a perk for people who like to read while in a pool, bathtub, or hot tub.

There’s also new themes you can do that change the “theme” of your screen while you read. I haven’t messed around too much with that but seems like a cool new addition.

It’s also lighter and a tad thinner than the previous Paperwhite model. So, that’s a plus.

The photos I’ve added are of the device, and the black cloth fabric.

If you’re looking for a nice e reader, that isn’t too pricey, has a nice flush screen, with some cool perks like it being water resistant, I suggest this one. It does the same stuff as the Oasis and Voyage which are more expensive. This to me is just as nice and a lot more affordable."
Robert,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First Day Review - I'll update as time goes on.
This was bought for myself, wife, 8 year old daughter and for reading to our 3 year old daughter. We read every single night for a good hour together and listen to a massive amount of Audible books.

So far everything has been very underwhelming. Actually... super underwhelming.
1. Very minimal packaging - Good in that it uses very little resources but bad when compared to what your used to getting with today's gadgets. ps. It still came in a box that could fit a good 10 Kindle Paper Whites.
2. Instantaneous first impression from myself, wife, and 8 year old daughter was how small it was. To the point of too small. Expected a larger screen or better screen to body ratio which leads to the next point.
3. Crazy large bezels!!! I mean ridiculously large. This is very similar to the original 2012 Nexus 7 Android Tablet. That's 7 year old design language. Are you kidding?!?!?!
4. Still using Micro USB. My phone that came out over two years ago has USB C and most of our new gadgets bought since then are USB C. Again we seem to be going backwards in time here.
5. No night mode. The first thing I did when I layed down to read was to try and invert the colors. I couldn't believe this was not a feature of the most popular mainstream ebook reader.
6. Worst of all and what brought me to writing a review within the first few hours after opening the box is the Kindle ecosystem. What a discombobulated disaster!!! I spent hours hunting through different apps on my smartphone and on the paperwhite trying to get a few books for the kids. Within the first hour I had 3 apps for getting books. The first book I went to get from the app store said free with Kindle Unlimited so I signed up for the free trial to check it out. I then went to search for more books that are part of Kindle Unlimited and soon found out how cumbersome that is to do. There is no Kindle Unlimited browsing mode in the Amazon app on my smartphone so no way to easily look through what's available. I then tried doing different types of searches in the app using kindle unlimited in the search terms but that was becoming cumbersome and not yielding good results. I then Googled how to browse Kindle Unlimited books. Instructions said that you could when using the Kindle app. So I then install the Kindle app so that I could better browse the Unlimited selection. I soon hit another brick wall when there was hardly anything to browse in the Kindle Unlimited section of the Kindle app and there is no search specific to Kindle Unlimited. After getting super frustrated with the poor ecosystem I took a break for an hour. After that I started searching for more books and came upon Howl's Moving Castle. There I noticed it said $0 with freeTimeunlimited. So, another subscription service that another set of books are a part of...I guess I'll sign up and see what it's about. I then go through the process of setting up my daughter's account but Howl's Moving Castle did not show up on her FreeTimeunlimited. I then tried to get the book in the Amazon app on my phone and it takes to to install a new FreeTimeunlimited app...a third app!! I decided to go back to the Kindle and try again. I exited the FreetimeUnlimited mode and went to the book again and clicked the read for free. It then launches freeTimeUnlimted but the book is not there. Another fail! I then try to use the search and nothing shows up in the search with the freetimeunlimited. Failed again. After that I uninstalled everything off my phone and cancelled the two subscriptions I had just signed up for and decided I'll just by the books outright. What a messy ecosystem that doesn't even work properly when you spend the time wading through the muck.

I'm just about to the point of returning this thing. I'll give it a couple more days and see how it goes but I think it's already at my limit of bad design choices and ecosystem failures."
Josh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quick summary in case you don’t want to read my whole review: This is the best Kindle ever. If you are searching for a great reading device then this is the one you want!

I’ve had many Kindles over the years, beginning with the very first one with the full keyboard and the strange looking scroll wheel with LCD indicator. At the time that first Kindle was amazing even though it is a dinosaur by today’s standards.

From there I moved on to the subsequent smaller models without the keyboard, the original Paperwhite with the built in lighting, the fancy new Oasis last year, and finally to my current Kindle which is the most recent Paperwhite prior to this new release.

Last year I wrote in my review of the Oasis (which you can view here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X98VSOJ61Z4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075M8FDWM) that despite the Oasis being a great, premium device, I still recommend just buying the Paperwhite. Despite the Paperwhite not being waterproof like the Oasis, having a different (smaller) screen size with less LEDs for lighting, and not having the “premium” device feel with the metal case I still preferred the Paperwhite due to it’s comparably low cost and I actually liked the feel of the case better when reading. Ultimately I returned the Oasis and purchased the Paperwhite. For my money the only thing that was really missing on the Paperwhite compared to the Oasis was the waterproofing.

And now… (drumroll….) the Paperwhite has waterproofing!

For me just knowing this one new feature (the waterproofing) is enough to know that this is the best Kindle yet because I already put the previous Paperwhite in that top position.

For good measure I had to immediately test the waterproof feature. Be sure to see my pictures, since seeing is believing! First I just simulated spilling a glass of water on it. That was easy to clean up with just a few swipes of a paper towel. Then I actually submerged the entire device in a bowl of water. It continued to work fine even while underwater and when I removed it the paper towel wiped it dry without any issues. The only residual water were some drips from the charging port on the bottom (the only port on the new Kindle Paperwhite). I gave the unit a few good shakes and the remaining water came out of the port (shaking produced a surprising amount of water!). Test passed!

The other new things are kind of a bonus to me, the main ones being:
- 8 GB of storage on the base model. This now matches the Oasis base storage. I really don’t think you need a lot of storage on a Kindle unless you will be away from Wi-Fi for long periods of time and need to be able to carry tons of books on the device, but having extra space can’t hurt.
- Flush front screen. It’s nice that the screen and the bezel around the screen are now flush so you can easily wipe things off the screen without them potentially getting stuck along the edges. Previous models had the screen sunken below the bezels so it was always possible that something could get stuck under the bezel. This flush design just makes it easier to clean without worrying about those edges.
- Audible. This may be a big deal to you if you use Audible a lot. You can now listen to your Audible books via Bluetooth headphones or speakers. For some reason I feel like I would just use my phone if I wanted to listen to Audible, but if you’d rather use the Kindle it’s now an option with the Paperwhite for the first time. Other Kindle models have had it for years and now it’s finally available on the Paperwhite.

In the past I always criticized the Paperwhite models for having uneven lighting. I am happy to report that the lighting on this new model is much improved and seems to be very even now! Despite still only using 5 LEDs versus the Kindle Oasis’ 12 LED setup I think it would actually be hard to tell the difference between the two. Previously I could see lots of “hot” and “cold” spots on the Paperwhite screens where the lighting was uneven. I am not noticing that nearly as much now, if at all! So even though the Oasis has a technically better lighting setup I think most people will find that the new Paperwhite screen is perfectly fine for low light reading (see picture).

As I said in the beginning, I had already recommended the last generation Paperwhite over the Oasis even without the waterproofing, larger storage, or Audible support. Now that the Paperwhite has all of those things and a seemingly improved lighting system it’s an even better buy! The Paperwhite is just shy of half the price of the Oasis as of this review making it an incredible value!

If you already have the most recent Paperwhite then there’s not a huge difference and upgrading may not be worth it to you. The main things you’ll get are the waterproofing and the Audible support. I upgraded mine mainly to get the waterproofing. Using Amazon to trade in my old Paperwhite I was able to buy the new one for around half price (they pay you for the old device AND give you a coupon for a discount on the new one). For me it was worth it, but of course you’ll have to decide for yourself if the new features are worth the cost of upgrading.

If you don’t have a Paperwhite already then it’s a no-brainer and this new one is the model to get.

Pros:
- Waterproof! Now you can read by the pool, on the beach, or in the tub without fear of destroying your device.
- Lighting system seems to be improved and provides a more even light pattern compared to previous Paperwhite models.
- Flush screen makes cleaning smudges or dirt easier.
- Audible support means you can listen to your books via Bluetooth.
- Double the base storage of the previous model, now matches the Oasis with 8 GB to start.
- Great Kindle interface just like all the models. There’s really no need to review this as it’s basically the same as it has been and works great for what it’s purpose is.
- Thin and light, easy to hold while reading with a nice texture that doesn’t feel like it will fall out of your hand.

Cons:
- None! Unless you count the plastic case as one versus the Oasis metal case (I don’t since I like the feel of the Paperwhite’s rubberized back better)… or if you think 12 LED lights on the Oasis are better than 5 on the Paperwhite, but again the Paperwhite’s lighting is much improved and provides a very nice, even light.

The bottom line here is that this is by far the best Kindle device for the money. It’s worth the extra price compared to the base Kindle just because it gets you the lighting (which to me is a requirement for reading in bed or reading on the plane) and now it gets you waterproofing. The jump up to the Oasis really is even less justified now as the Oasis just gets you a metal case, a marginally better screen size/aspect ratio, and MAYBE better lighting… for almost twice the price.

Buy this one. There’s no reason to look at the other models.

TIP: If you happen to already have a sleeve-type case for your previous Paperwhite then the case will most likely also fit the new Paperwhite. I’ve been using this case for about a year and it fits the new model great as well: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073GFS4K8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
Mongoose MTU,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I struggle reviewing this product. On one hand, it has some great features that haven't been available in Kindle e-readers before (namely water resistance); On the other hand, it still does not allow me to read a book while listening to the book (immersive reading).

I traded in my previous generation paperwhite because this device offered audible support which I thought would mean that I would be able to have an immersive reading/listening experience. Unfortunately that is not the case. A Kindle that can play audiobooks but cannot integrate a reading experience does not make sense.

If you have a previous generation Kindle Paperwhite that still holds a charge and you've never had to worry about getting it wet, keep using it and save your money."
PATRICIA W.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It took forever to get live customer service from Amazon but when I did, it was excellent and now I can enjoy my Kindle paperwhite. But, before this, I was almost ready to return this and I'm glad I didn't. The seller didn't seem to know how to help. On Amazon's website, I found no 800# for customer service.
Everything's easy when you know how but after getting help changing the language and getting connected to wifi, I'm good to go."
grammy H,1.0 out of 5 stars,I own a Kindle Fire which was only about $50 a couple of years ago. I ordered the new Paperwhite because it promised longer battery time between charges. But I returned it immediately because you can't adjust the background light at all and there was very little adjustment possible for font size. I much prefer the Fire even if I have to plug it in to the charger daily. An important feature that was missing from the Paperwhite is the ability to set a time that it changes from blue-white to amber light when you are near bedtime.
Bemberly,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this early because I pre-ordered it but Amazon wouldn't let me review it because it wasn't really released yet. It's probably a good thing because it gave me a little more time with it. That being said, I'm not that crazy about it after all and I would still be using my kindle paperwhite (previous generation) if the charging port didn't stop working (coincidentally) the day this was announced, (go figure). That's the first thing to go on all Amazon devices whether it's a Kindle Fire HD or Reader. Amazon needs to check themselves.
For the New Kindle Paperwhite the SCREEN looks more like a tablet than a book. I thought the whole purpose of the Paperwhite was that it looked like the pages of a book. Soft and creamy as in my picture. The picture on the left is the NEW PW and on the right is the OLD PW (same degree). Even though the Old PW is creamy it's much easier to read and brighter in it's own right. The New PW now has that blue light we were trying to get away from, so it's harder on the eyes and you will spend less time reading from it. It defeats the purpose. (If it ain't broke don't fix it). Hope you can see the difference in the pictures. Also the battery life is not as long as other generations. I love Amazon devices and I have all of them. Not loving this one yet but I guess I don't have a choice but to get used to it. I hope I do. The size is exactly the same but flatter so it doesn't fit your old case. It's ever so slightly loose. What's that about? It is waterproof though that was never my concern. The screen is completely flat with no ridge (hence the waterproofing). I do still like it because it is a Paperwhite. I just don't love it...yet? Oh, you also have an extra step when you want to change the font. It's now a drop down menu. Before you just clicked on the ""Aa"" and there you were.

Well I hope this helps. It's not bad it's just not what I was happy with."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This does not have text to speech, only voice view. Voice view makes it hard to navigate to the book. It also doesn't have the features that the uk version has. The uk has immersion reading. You can play the audible version of the book and read along with the text. Our version the page disappears. It will even highlight the words as they are spoken. I bought this for a special education class. I feel ripped off that we do not have the same features as Europe. It took 2 hours on the phone with an out of country customer service to realize that we do not have the same features. She kept instructing me to touch the center of the screen for these features. When the features do not exist, touching the center if the screen is a waste of time. I am sorry I purchased it. Worse then my older paperwhite. Feels cheap, page looks funny. I can listen to audible on my phone. I don't need a paperwhite to hear my books. It didn't deliver features promosed.promised."
toaster,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Was pretty bummed out to get a unit with a dead e-ink pixel. Will probably return the unit (still within refund window).
My 2nd gen paperwhite is still going strong. I guess quality control has slipped since then?"
Crystal,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am moving to the kindle from the nook. My nook device is great but it just so happens, Amazon products and apps run my life. The nook made no sense. This kindle is perfect! Easy on the eyes. Tiny. Simple to use."
futurefan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After five years or so, I decided to upgrade from the Generation 5 Paperwhite to the latest (Gen 10) model, hoping that there would be significant improvements. It is a little sharper in pixel esolution, but not much more black and white than the dark to light gray of the Gen 5. It is a little faster in response as well, but not much. I did have a problem getting the Kindle to properly detect Library changes or receive samples, but after talking with someone at Amazon, we were able to resolve the problem by de-registering and re-registering the Paperwhite to get it working properly.

I would really like to see better contrast on the black to white scale, and hope that Amazon is still trying to bring about color e-ink in the future.

In short, this latest generation of the Paperwhite is a good device if you don't have an earlier generation of the device, but I would recommend waiting a little longer if you have an earlier generation and are looking for something much better for the cost of getting something new."
Leanna,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have had a kindle before, then you will be familiar with the 10th gen and in general how it works.

Pros:
*More control over page format and layout, font, etc.
*Waterproof, the screen is continuous from edge to page. No hairs or lint getting trapped.
*Works with bluetooth headphones

Cons
*The brightness is too bright, brighter seeming than my last gen paperwhite (this is terrible at night)
*No blue light filter this would have been nice for reading at night.
*Not USB-C for charging for a new version this is stuck in the past.
*The home screen sucks, take me right to my library!
*I'm not a fan if the current cases (no rubber lining so less shock absorption), hopefully this will change.
*Takes longer to ""wake up"" after hitting the power button or opening the cover than previous models
*Battery life is terrible!
*The screen isn't textured like the older versions so it no longer feels like paper. This not only feels nice but helped me to navigate the page from the rest of the kindle.

Everything about this is terrible except for the very minor pros. I loved my old kindles so I hoped they would continue to get better like older ones have in the past. They went backwards with this one. It feels like an unfinished product rushed to get it out in time for the holidays. The cons outweigh the pros by too much."
Joan Sawyer,1.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t like the paper white kindle at all. I am not interested in your recommendations; they just crowd up the screen. Organizing the books into categories is time consuming and awkward. It is also annoying that your description of it never stated that you couldn’t listen to audiobooks unless you had blue tooth. If I knew I’d have to buy Bluetooth headphones I wouldn’t have bought this device.
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, mother and mother-in-law love. Read the fine print for the Unlimited 6mo, this is for only one kinder per buyer account."
Delighted Artist,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am adding on to my previous review... I never realized that my hands moved so much when I read my Kindle, but I was constantly causing Kindle to page forward and backward which drove me crazy! I could find no setting to freeze or shut down this constant movement in my former Kindle. This new Paperwhite has a new setting that allows you to ""Disable the Touchscreen"" which is the solution to correct the constant jumping pages... However, you have change this setting every time to start to read! Also, it takes a long time to turn or start this new Kindle. The swipe to start takes much longer then my older Kindle! Would I still buy this Kindle over a regular Kindle? Absolutely! Am I thrilled with the new improvements, NO! This is my initial review... So what's so much better about this paperwhite? First, it's not as sensitive as my last one! I spent more time going backwards then forward! No matter how I set my ""Settings"" it was just too touchy and too sensitive! This paperwhite with about 25 hours of reading time so far, works like a dream! If this your FIRST Kindle...Please make note: I get approximately 12 hours from 1 charge on my Paperwite!! NOT WEEKS! That weeks bit is clarified by saying ""if you read 1/2 hour per day!"" Well.... I read 6-8 hours per day! I do use my ""Fast Charge"" charger and it takes about 3 hours, but I can still read when it's plugged in.
I do have the insurance but have never had to use it. I have had kindles forever and they have been a Godsend because of my eyesight and arthritis in my hands, However, I am also the worlds biggest klutz! My Kindles have been dropped on every kind of floor and surface imaginable. We have tile and hardwood floors at home and my Kindle has flown down the hardwood stairs numerous times! I do keep it in it's case, but the glass has never scratched or broken.
I'm looking forward to trying out the new audible features, I'm sure I will be pleased."
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This device is garbage, and so is Amazon and its software developers.

Unresponsiveness is the primary flaw of any computer system. Not letting the user know what's going on is a close second. Amazon gets 5 stars for both flaws.

I had intended to upgrade my Paperwhite bought in May 2018 with this new 32GB version. I own over 5,000 kindle books and numerous Kindles. I'm a former software developer.

As of now my device has 24.41 GB of 27.3 GB free. It lags, it won't sync, it won't download dictionaries or covers, or find recently bought books. It's locked up numerous times requiring a restart and crashed a couple times.

It will however always refresh Amazon's ads.

Nice job, Amazon.

Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have returned one because of the yellow screen. It was also non-responsive to touch about 50% of the time and very very slow. No problem with the power cord. I have Paperwhite that I bought in 2016 and I loved it. The last update wrecked the battery, so I ordered this new version. I wasn’t interest in the audio feature as I have dealt with crappy speakers on Kindle products (including my Fire HDX 8.9) for years. I also wasn’t interestd unless it had Immersion reading. Switching back and from audio to reading is awkward and distracting. I need the earphone plug port. Can’t use earbuds and the headphones get incredibly hot. I have some over ear hinge sets with small light foam ear pads that sit on the outer ear (Panasonic) that are all I can use but they don’t come wireless. External speakers are out of the question because of living situation. My devices never go near water so the trade off of a true “paper white” screen vs a dappled yellowish screen for waterproofing isn’t worth it. I have to set the brightness to around 17 to get the same brightness my old PW had set at 4. The Fire HDX 8.9 was great...except it was hard on my eyes and then it got very temperamental. I’m trying not to have it die on me and the Paperwhite was a perfect companion. Until it wasn’t, with this new version. I’m keeping this replacement Paperwhite because I need the ereader. Anyone who has an older version should wait until a better upgrade comes out. There is nothing about this one that makes the trade worth it.

I simply can’t understand why Amazon Would come out with an inferior e-reader for the Audible listening/Immersion reading experience when they push the Immersion experience so hard. What they did was degrade the actual reading experience. Amazon can do better because the *have* done better.

My experience with Customer Service for the return was excellent. The secret is to get an actual Kindle CS rep. I believe you go up a tier and they are more experienced and have more latitude with making adjustments. And yes, the language barrier can be problematic, especially if one has hearing issues. But the CS reps have always been courteous, and in this day and age that counts for something."
Mackenzie Brunt,1.0 out of 5 stars," I read a lot so I figured I should get a kindle because kindle books tend to be cheaper. I revieved it in the mail, opened the packaging charged it with no problems but when I actually started to use it the screen started to glitch. It doesn’t happen all the time, I’d say maybe 50% of the time, when I click on something or flip the page the screen will go black for a second and then back to normal. I don’t know if I just received a faulty kindle or not, I sure hope that not all of them are like this."
Erin L,5.0 out of 5 stars,"12/5/18 update: After writing my original review on the battery life of my Kindle, I was pleasantly surprised that Amazon/Kindle customer service called me directly the next day to troubleshoot. I was provided some simple steps to take with my Kindle (doing a force reboot, plugging in overnight). After doing this, my batter issue is no longer there. It lasts for days/weeks. I am so happy!

I was so excited to get this new Kindle to replace my older one (purchased in 2010). I am happy with the lighter weight and it’s easier to hold onto. However, the battery is terrible. My old one would last weeks. This one has drained 20% in just 2 hours of reading (backlight off, in airplane mode). I really hope this is a software issue that will be fixed, or if customer service can help with troubleshooting. But that’s what you get for something that’s brand new/just released."
Happy Curmudgeon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty much as expected. Text not as black as I would like and battery while much better than the phone I was using is not lasting as long as some claimed. It's also crashed once in the four days I’ve had it. The Internet browser while called a ”Experimental Browser” probably Beta would be better as it is almost useless which surprised me.
LT,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes for this device. In fact, it was going to be my Christmas present. The description made me think it would be a beefed up, touch-screen version of the older Kindle keyboard with free 3G service. I can hardly describe my level of disappointment, but I’m going to try so you can save yourself the money and the hassle.
First, I will give the few positives. The device is a light weight, the paperwhite screen is a good feature, and the light is handy. That’s it on the plus side.

For the negatives, (1) The power button is on the bottom, so I am constantly accidentally locking or shutting off the unit (2) Amazon didn’t include a charger plug, just a USB cord (Really, at this price point?). (3) No external speaker. I could live with this if I could easily pair to external Bluetooth speakers or earbuds, but nothing about this device is intuitive or easy. Once you pair a device, you will constantly be kicked out of text to speech (now called VoiceView) by notifications or by accidentally touching the screen (ironically the only time the screen is semi-responsive). (4) Poor touch screen sensitivity on everything expect page turning and when in VoiceView (5) Incomprehensibly bad text to speech/VoiceView. I can’t imagine trying to use this feature if I were visually impaired. Simply finding the buried volume control is ludicrously difficult. I double touched and double touched trying to get the volume to change. It just kicks you out. (6) Once you are in VoiceView, the only workable way to navigate is to shut off your Bluetooth speaker or earbud and go back to the home screen, turn the Bluetooth back on from your speaker, and then finally go back into your book. (7) Every option is buried. I just friggin want listen to a book using VoiceView/Text to Speech, not hunt and hunt for everything! (8) The battery life is not weeks, in my experience. I started with a full battery and had to charge it up after six hours. (9) The suggestions and ads are intrusive. I didn’t pay for an ad free device, I get that; however, past devices had confined the selling to the lock screen or suggestions at the end of a book. They are in your face now. Note, while digging through layers of menus, I did run across the option to turn off suggestions. (10) I was never able to listen to any of the Audible books that I have already purchased. Amazon is very anxious to get you to buy more books, but not so eager to let you listen to ones you already own. Yes, I did call for help. No, I didn’t get help. I still haven’t a clue what the rep said. She just read some spiel from a script about the wonders of Audible in attempt to sell me a subscription and I don’t think she even knew, let alone cared, about resolving what I had called about. I could go on and on, but you get the point. (11) When you are in Text to Speech/Whatever the heck they call it now, there is loud, awful noise that interrupts the story at the end of every page. (12
) The free 3G did not work. I put it right next to an old Kindle Keyboard with free 3G and the old model did work.

I get the impression that different groups designed different areas of the device and they didn’t ever speak to each other, they just dumped everything together into this clunky embarrassment of a device. Did they even let a few end users try this thing? My recommendation? Buy a basic paperwhite or better yet, go to Ebay and buy a Kindle keyboard with free 3G. They work a lot better than this. I'm returning this for refund and will start looking for a Kindle keyboard myself.

I have become more and more disenchanted with Amazon, but their e-readers and tablets have been reasonably good, at least until the past few generations. Software issues, battery issues, SD/memory issues, and poor designs are piling up and I have become more and more frustrated. Kindle support used to be a selling point, but now I can’t even get decent trouble shooting. Calling Amazon and being told to shut the device off (by someone I can’t understand and who can’t understand me) and then sending it back to Amazon isn’t device support. It’s laziness and poor service. I have over 30 kindle e-readers and tablets, so I’m not a novice user. For the first time, I’m looking at other companies for e-readers because Amazon is no longer cutting it."
Logan Berry,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So I never write reviews. However after buying this as a gift for my brother and purchasing a BUNCH of comics on it for him to enjoy I was shocked to realize a $130 tablet reader was exclusively in black and white. It is 2018, people... my phone can video call people. Yet a newly produced $130 reader can’t show a comic book in color?! The product should not be advertised to be able to house comic books if it has no color. Color to a comic book is like sound to a television show. It IS a necessity. This is basically an electronic book, which is worse than a regular book as it basically dangles the amazing technology advances of our generation while throwing out the groundbreaking digital color from 1953."
Elsa Mei Arcilla,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sub-par production quality of the display is very apparent and obvious. It isn’t flush to the surface, the gap is distracting.

Mine has one dead pixel and I can’t decide if I should risk returning it and wasting all the time I spent on setting it up or I should gamble, exchange it for another one and waste twice as much time to set it up. Plus I’d be losing the amount paid for removing ads either way.

It’s 2018 and it’s shocking to see that there’s no way to change the Images that you see on the lock screen when you open the cover. This device has this massive oversight, a feature we pretty much take for granted on the cheapest things you can buy today.

Overall I don’t know why I spent twice more than a comparable reader for this. And I’m contemplating whether to get used to it or whether to return or exchange it.

I highly recommend not getting this device. Look into kobo or literally any other e-ink display equipped tablet."
katcon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my newest e-reader. I have owned every Kindle but the Oasis. This is my favorite. I love that it waterproof with Bluetooth capabilities.
I couldn't afford to put out the money all at once with the holidays coming. Thanks Amazon for offering the payment plan.
The reader is the perfect size and light weight.
I highly recommend this e-reader."
kyle oestreich,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Added waterproofing and audible drove me to trade in my original kindle which lasted the last 5 years. Hopefully this one stands up just as long.

My only concern currently is in the previous version, the touch screen was minimally recessed so if placed face down, the screen did not make contact with surfaces, giving it some protection. This new one is flush across the entire front face. It may amount to nothing but increases the off chance of scratches/damage. Still the device feels solidly build."
jaywalking,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not that much different from the last version. I still like the paperwhite, but this one is still as slow as the last version. The weight is not noticeably lighter. The battery seems about the same. I would not recommend spending money on upgrading if you have the older version of the paperwhite and you think it is okay."
Gregory Isaac,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Original Review:

I purchased the older model kindle paperwhite on prime day refurbished and absolutely loved it. It had great battery life and I found a not too expensive case for it which made me love it more. Fast forward to today. Ive had the new Kindle Paperwhite for a week and here are some impressions. The battery life is not as good. Not sure if its a software issue but even in airplane mode it seems to drain fairly quickly. I am also having issues with book lag. Every few pages I will tap the screen and the words will just stay there. I tap again and of course it moves two pages. I contacted Amazon and they said simply restart the kindle. That seemed to work for a bit but it started doing it again. It was on several books and not just one so I already tried deleting and reinstalling the books. The Kindle is just a week old so maybe there are some kinks out there that are in the process of being worked out but so far Im regretting turning in my older heavier kindle for the brand new one. If you have the old one and it still seems to be running fine, I would say stick with it until Amazon has some fixes for the new one. The battery life difference can not be understated.

Update 12/10/18
Praise the Lord: After a month of my kindle being so buggy that i barely touched it Amazon released a software update that from what I can tell has fixed all of the issues that I initially stated above. The pages no longer freeze and the battery seems to be improved. Thanks Amazon for the fix."
Kirk in Chicago,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The device refuses to connect to either of two wifi networks I use all the time. Tech support was no help. So, I cannot make any use of the device. It's going back to Amazon."
Maheer M Kibria,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First off let me say this kindle is better than the previous generation in almost every conceivable way. The new design aesthetics are a marked improvement. Not having a recessed display should mean less dust buildup in the edges. The display feels crisper and cleaner. And overall the device feels more responsive. However, I have 2 issues with this device. First is false advertising. This device is water resistant not water proof. At least according to the documentation in the box. Second is that the light is a lot cooler than the old light and I prefer the warmer feel of the old backlight"
Levi,3.0 out of 5 stars,"1) The USB cable did not fit the paperwhite. They are aware of the issue but are still shipping kindles with bad USB cables. when contacted they are sending a correct cable. 2) you can no longer swipe right to left to see you library, must select library link. Not terrible but change for no reason. 3) Sometime the new paperwhite does not respond, frozen for a bit (frustrating) 4) Home screen font is very small, seems harder to read than my previous paperwhite. 5) batter life is terrible compared to previous paperwhite which did in fact last for weeks. Mine has went down 30% in one day. This puppy may be going back. I would say wait to order and see if some of these issues are corrected with new software."
Desiree B.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I admit, I should have done more research in advance, but I was shocked when the Kindle arrived. I wanted a device for my grandchildren (ages 5 and 9) to read, without being distracted by games. It is extremely lightweight for sure, but it is tiny. The amount of actual page size is only 3 x 4, and with a reasonable font size (for small children or older adults) barely a paragraph of text displays.

In addition, the screen response is extremely slow taking well over a second to turn pages, with a very distracting flashing fade in/out for any graphics on the page, especially when changing screens (returning home, etc.). Response time on the actual touch screens is very slow for anyone used to using a tablet.

The most disappointing for me is that it is all black and white. It honestly never occurred to me that children's books would be black and white as well. As I bought this as a gift for my grandchildren to read library books and such, I don't think this will be used at all (who wants a gorgeous picture book in black and white?). It will be returned...for the almost $200 cost (with cover and charger, etc.) I expected much more.

Update: Received a call from Amazon to try to resolve some of my issues. Really appreciated, but in discussion, tried downloading more children's books that I had previously purchased through Amazon. Imagine our surprise to learn that most of them would not download with an ""incompatible format"" error...these are KINDLE books, from Amazon, and they don't work on a KINDLE! While I appreciated the attempt to resolve the issues, the additional flaw for children (the point of my purchase) makes the device sub-par. At least Amazon has a great return policy!"
SpartanED,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll be honest. The main reason why I bought this is because I really wanted an ebook reader with a backlit display, and this one is discounted for students. First off, these are first impressions and have not been using it long-term. I already noticed missing features and questionable design choices, but relented because I really wanted an ebook reader at a bargain.
The first thing that struck me about this reader, is that it is surprisingly thin and light. The words are crisp, and I noticed a uniform light distribution throughout the display. I did not notice any pinholes or the like that some others have noticed. The backing of the device is a comfortable, soft-touch finish. I enjoy that. The 8GB is enough for most people, unless you're heavy into graphic novels and PDFs, the Wi-Fi only model will suit just about everybody, and the Special Offers is unobtrusive and therefore is fine to have (it only shows an ad on the lock screen and can be disabled at a later date). The main competitors to this device are the Nook GlowLight and the Kobo Clara HD/Aura 2.

Now that the overview is over, here are some pros and cons:

PROS:
-Crisp, clear display
-Even light-distribution
-Soft-touch backing
-Water-Resistant
-Thin and light
-Integration with Goodreads
-Invert display makes for great nighttime reading
-Great reading assistance (dictionary, flashcards, X-Ray, etc)
-(This one is a game-changer). The Kindle and Audible store is AMAZING to have because I already use both services on other devices. I like how there are free books if you have a Prime account, and the Kindle Unlimited subscription is not too bad. For me, this separates it from other services.

CONS:
-Why is the power button on the bottom of the device? At least allow the user to change the orientation of the display instead of just portrait and landscape. This is easy to depress when you set the Kindle and prop it up. I don't see any reason for this.
-Micro-USB and NOT a Type-C connector for charging. For a 2018 Kindle, just about every device has transitioned to Type-C and is disappointing to not see it here. I thought I would finally be able to use one connector for all my devices, but not here.
-The LED lights do NOT allow the user to change the color-temperature. This is one of the BIGGEST drawbacks. Just about all the competitors allow users to change the light to be warmer, which is a lot easier on the eyes. Right now the light is too white and blue (cool temperature) and is very disappointing to not be allowed to make it warmer.
-The LED does not have ambient light auto-adjust. This is ridiculous. Not having the light to adjust in intensity when you move to different environments kills the experience to me because I have to keep manually adjusting it.
-The above adjustment may not be so bad if it is simple to adjust the backlight and other font settings. Unfortunately, the current software forces you to first tap the top of your screen, THEN tap Settings, THEN be able to adjust brightness (changing the font goes another step further than this). Ok I am nitpicking here, but it is super annoying if you want to change the light quickly because it is not a one-step process.

Overall:

I really like this device. I enjoy the reading experience and I got it at a good price-point. Amazon has always been good to me, but they really made some questionable decisions. I can do without Bluetooth, Audible, water-resistance, and other things if they would simply allow better color temperature options, auto-adjust the light intensity, and simplify the process to change the light and font. This kills the experience a bit.
I did give this a harsh rating. I am not saying this reader is bad. On the contrary I think it's the best reader if you have a Prime membership. Period. But it is super frustrating that a mega-company like Amazon would introduce features that many users will never use or do not care for, and neglect the many features that readers will appreciate (not to mention that most of its competitors have already integrated better light control and design!). It is for this that I will weigh the cons more critically.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. This is my first review of this length, but I felt like I really had to inform the public and Amazon of how conflicted I am with this reader. A mega-company like Amazon should not COMPROMISE like this. With that being said, I am enjoying my new Kindle Paperwhite and will be keeping it."
Dennifer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't listen to the entitled.

TLDR; Just y**tube reviews of it. There are tons of unboxing/review videos. If you are a surgeon shopper like myself, do it and then decide. Cheers!

Ahh 2018... the year of entitlement and review bombing. For the record, this thing is the same or better in every way then is predecessor. Period. All the bad reviews are old-timers who don't understand how device upgrades work (even comparing it to completely different models - ""The power button is on the bottom when before it was on the back..."" -Old woman from Happy Gilmore. That's because it not the Voyage 2. And now good news boys and girls - Arts and crafts time has been extended by 2 hours today), or young people who are entitled. Could there be a bad batch out there? Sure, but that doesn't explain away the outright misinformation. People are just complaining to complain, yet offering no actual constructive criticism.

So comparing this Paperwhite 4 to previous ""Paperwhites,"" let me address the BS:

-Someone said you can't adjust the read time/% left on the page anymore, unless you go into settings. BS!
-Someone said the screen temperature is yellow (more yellow than the Paperwhite 3 - Bad Batch?). BS! And Amazon will exchange it for you for this reason.
-Someone said the battery is SUPER bad and only lasts 6 hours before needing a charge. Complete BS!
-Someone said it's not waterproof. BS! And just plain stupid as that's a main selling point (watch y**tube peeps)
-Someone said you can't invert the colors for night reading like the Oasis. BS!
-Someone said the screen being flush is worse. BS! This is subjective, but honestly it's easier to clean now.
-Someone said it's lighter and hence flimsier. Half BS! They are correct, it is lighter! BUT there is nothing more flimsy about this than the Paperwhite 3, BS!
-Someone said it's slower. BS! It has a new ultra power-saving mode which can make it take 3-5 sec more at startup, which you can disable in the settings. SETTINGS > DEVICE OPTIONS > ADVANCED OPTIONS > POWER SAVER. Other than that, it is just as fast. If yours isn't, you got a dud so exchange it.
-Someone said the screen isn't 10"" ...no comment.
-Someone said it doesn't support games *blink blink* Did you think you were buying a PS4?
-Someone said there's no improvements over previous models. uh... BS! Read below.

These are legitimate reviews on here. Talk about first world entitlment problems. Coming from a Paperwhite 3, this is pretty much the exact same ereader, but with some serious improvements laid out below:

-Is lighter yet just as firm as previous model
-Is waterproof (Seriously watch y**tube. This thing takes a bath in a vat of soda, tomato sauce, oil, honey, and water, you name it and survives just fine).
-Has 8gb of storage.
-Is every bit as white as Paperwhite 3 (There could be a bad batch, fair enough, but mine is more white, so they apparently fixed it)
-Battery life is just as good as Paperwhite 3 (maybe a little better per ultra power saving mode)
-Has night mode. Can invert colors - this was the true selling point for me (no more disturbing my wife at night), and it is beautiful and uniform
-Flush screen makes it easier to swipe, clean, and the new soft screen is easier on the fingers
-Bluetooth. Can listen to audible now
-It has an Ultra Power Saving mode now to conserve even more battery when idle. Yes, this is a pro. People are confusing this as the device is now slower for no reason. There's a reason, it's saving your battery even more than previous models. Furthermore, you can turn it off if you want your 3-5 seconds back.
Everything else is pretty much the same, which isn't a bad thing.

Does that sound like no improvements? Just because some/any of those pros don't apply to you doesn't mean it doesn't apply to everyone. Only you can decide if the new features will be worth it for you, but it DOES provide the new features Amazon said it does. Complainers will complain. Ironic how none of these complainers ever put in their input on the features they feel would be the ""huge improvements"" they want, no, they just complain. People even complained it doesn't match previous cases... *blink blink* when has a new model on any device - ever, done this? Truly these are first world problems and entitlement issues.

Is it a HUGE upgrade over the Paperwhite 3, Voyage, or Oasis? No. Can it make you steak and eggs and rub your feet? No. Did Amazon tout is as such? No. Is it a refresh of an already good ereader with some cool new features? Yes. And to some people those might be pretty BIG upgrades (waterproof is pretty big if you read by the pool, beach, or bath tub. Lighter might mean the world to someone with arthritis. Bluetooth & 8gb is awesome for the person on the train who wants audible). To me it is a 5-star device."
Stephen Burket,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far it's awesome. I have a Kindle Fire an have problems reading in the sun. This Paperwhite works in the sun or the dark. It's great for reading anywhere. It's small and light.
KatieR,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I travel a lot to places without secure internet access, and have always relied on the Kindle cellular connectivity. I ordered this latest paperwhite because we live on a boat and the warer-resistance feature was significant to me. I ordered the 8 gig version; I didn’t think I needed more. Well, it does NOT have cellular connectivity!!
I spent nearly Four hours on the phone with Amazon explaining that I needed cellular connectivity. A replacement was sent - and it was the the exact same thing!!! NO cellular connectivity. Another two hours on the phone; finally told for him he FIRST tme that cellular connectivity is ONLY available with the twice-the-price 32 gig version!!! I went back to website - the Kindle is advertised as a version that has wi-fi + cellular connectivity. It NO WHERE indicated to hat you have to buy the expensive 32 gig version to have cellular connectivity included when you pay extra for wireless. This is so he 6th(!) Kindle I have ordered, and every one of then until now had cellular connectivity. The Kindle website gives absolutely no indication that the 8 gig does not include cellular connectivity - indeed, the specs for ordering state “wireless + cellular connectivity.”
After all my years of loyalty to the Kindle, I disappointed and angry at what appears to be a false product description and a blatant Bait and Switch. The remedy offered was a $35 credit in consideration of the six plus hours I spent on the phone, making it crystal clear I needed cellular connectivity! I am disgusted with the time I spent on this issue, only to FINALLY be told that I needed to pay double for a 32 gig version, which is nowhere indicated in the Kindle product descriptions."
threeofsix,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Paperwhites are fantastic, and have been my favorite devices I own. I would give this model 5 stars, but the changes are underwhelming compared to my Paperwhite 2 (2013 model), and not all of them for the better. If you don't have a Paperwhite, you should get this. If you have an older model, your mileage may vary. My main takeaways are:

- Flush front feels nice and is easier to keep clean.
- The light is much bluer than my PW2. I'm most disappointed by this, and probably would have given it 5 stars if not for this issue alone.
- Inverting screen colors is nice for night reading, but should have been ported to all models. Disappointed they didn't add a warm light like Kobo and Nook have had for years.
- The screen resolution is higher than my PW2, and the same as the PW3. But on the other hand, it seems subtly grayer, with poorer contrast, and greater glare. I'd still call it an overall improvement over the PW2, but didn't expect such a trade-off.
- Adds waterproofing, Audible support, greater storage, and smaller size. All nice additions, but not a huge draw to me.
- PW3 had a black logo that blended in with the front. This model goes back to a silver logo. It usually isn't distracting, but still a step backwards in my opinion."
Arthur Eskowitz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned Kindle readers since their inception (first generation) and have purchased several since. My current library has close to 600 books that I have purchased and read. I was very excited when I learned of the new paperwhite as I felt that my current one was getting old and I was becoming frustrated with error messages and having to recharge it every couple of days. When I received the announcement for the ""All New Paper white"" and it said longer times between charges, water resistant etc I couldn't wait to get it. I per-ordered it I waited patiently for th release date to arrive. As soon as it came I put it to use. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. The display was supposed to be better; it isn't. The battery is supposed to last much longer. The advertising said lasts weeks instead of days; It doesn't. I do read a lot but to have to re charge this almost daily or at best I might get two days is not what I would consider acceptable> I guess it hold the charge longer if you don't use it> I am really not at all pleased with this item"
Rcst,1.0 out of 5 stars,"To start with, this is not a good option for reading in a dark room. First, because there is no night shift function (to reduce blue light). When I turn down the brightness very low, the text fades as well, and it's straining on my eyes. If I use invert colors (black background/white text), at every page turn there is a bright flash of light, as the kindle quickly inverts the white/black to black/white. ON EVERY PAGE TURN. Imagine that in a dark room. And—if you have highlights, those flash even brighter! So much for melatonin production. A good night's rest anyone?
The operating system lags most of the time, and the home page is bloated and confusing. Try to access the settings screen when you have highlighted text at the top of the page. You'll end up activating the dialogue box for the highlight instead.
These are details that are not easy to overlook. I consider this a low-quality device. I got it for $57, and I'm returning it. I've decided to go with an iPad mini, which is superior in every way."
Nilun,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The device as a whole is alright, but not usable by me. The backlight and battery are great features, but those aspects don't affect me as much. I was excited about Audible being connected with it and the screen reader that's included while also being able to look up the page I was on with a simple tap. I'm legally blind, so I have very little of my vision, and these two aspects were important to me.
Well, the bluetooth adapter goes to sleep when you pause after just a minute or two, making you have to reset the bluetooth settings in the Kindle to start it back up. Meanwhile, the screen reader automatically made everything sluggish and the screen started to phantom tap. After going through the tutorial for the screen reader I then downloaded my recent audio book, but there was no sound through my speaker. I tried to investigate, but everytime I tried to navigate to the screen reader settings I would be kicked back to the home menu before even clicking anything in the settings menu. Most of the time, the sluggish screen reader would either not receive the double taps that the tutorial explained to do, or it would also register a tap on the next screen, causing navigation issues. To top it off, you can't even change the size of text or pictures in the menus; you can only change font size while you're in a book, so if you need to navigate through the menus and you're screen reader/bluetooth is not working then good luck finding anything you want.
This was a very disappointing product for a person who is legally blind, and I thought at this point Amazon would be better with people who have disabilities. I was wrong. It's as if they didn't test the performance on the accessiblity settings with people who would actually use them. They just added it in last minute so they could add it as a feature and let the intern play with it for 15 minutes.
I returned this product and plan to not try another Kindle in the future. I hope this review will be helpful for others in the future."
ishlen65,1.0 out of 5 stars,The battery on this goes from 100% to 13% in one day with me barely reading! My old kindle lasts days. I'm going back to my old paperwhite and returning this
Dan O'Sterling,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a Kindle paperwhite when they first came out four years ago. Since then, I read an average of one book per month. Really enjoyed using the paperwite in different lighting conditions, Both at home and on vacations. This new paperwhite makes it much easier to change the brightness level. It is also much faster when it comes to choosing which book to read. One of the best features, is that it tells you when it's waking up and ready for you to swipe the screen to come on. The text is much sharper. The lighting is also more even. I would highly recommend this for anyone interested in an e-reader, even if you already have one. It's lightweight and the battery lasts seemingly forever."
Jones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded my older Paperwhite in for this new edition, mostly for the audible feature, although being waterproof was appealing too. First off the new screen is awful and gets covered in finger prints, which was never an issue with the texture of the old screen. Second, there is no option that I can find to sync the device, only individual books. I changed the name of a collection on Amazon and have since restarted the Paperwhite twice and it will not update the collection name on the device. Third Audible needs some major work. I have four books from the same author where I own the kindle version and the Audible version. Three of those sync up so that I can go to that collection and have one icon for the book from which I can access the Kindle and the Audiobook. For the forth book the kindle version shows up in the correct collection but the Audible version shows up on my homescreen and does not offer the option to combine the two or to add it to the collection. I have one additional audible book downloaded that is also stuck on my home screen despite it being part of a collection that is also downloaded onto the device. So basically I am unable to organize my home screen because the Audible books won't go into a collection unless you also own the kindle version, and even then it only works 75% of the time.

I wish I could have a do-over and get my old Paperwhite back and just stick to using my phone for Audible."
Rue,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery life of my old Kindle could be measured in weeks. This Kindle lasts only days if it is placed in airplane mode. For me, this is a major disappointment. Otherwise the Kindle works as expected but is not a significant improvement over previous generations. If a long battery life is important to you, don't buy it."
HelloViennaCalling,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Another product made worse by corporate developers. Good luck navigating through endless ads and unwanted “recommendations”. Confusing and nonsensical user interface. Every time the screen turns on, why do I then have to also swipe it? Oh, I guess it’s to get past the annoying cover page which informs the user books can be downloaded from the kindle store.

An example of the annoying user interface is I had to google how to change the font size (it’s easy once you know). But it should be something quick and obvious in Settings but it's not there.

It’s also challenging to delete unwanted or previously read “free samples”. I gave up and deleted them using my phone app.

Update: On vacation and unable to sign on to hotel wifi due to trying to get the kindle to accept user/password format. My first gen keyboard kindle had the 3G whisper-net enabling free AT&T reception around the world no login needed to order/upload or even surf the net. It was cool being in another country, finishing a book and having the next purchased and downloaded in minutes without dealing with wifi. Any chance of getting that functionality back?

Update: Another unwanted feature is that between the lines of text there indicates how many other readers have highlighted passages. SUPER ANNOYING! Seriously, was anybody who enjoys reading even involved in developing this kindle?"
M Robinson,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Update after a year of use: Still not a fan. Screen is NOT glare-free as advertised. Responsiveness of the touch screen has lessened from the not-too-great it was prior. Suddenly cannot return an Unlimited book from the device (though can check one out). Battery still drains very quickly if you use the backlight *at all*, even on the lowest. And I still haven't been able to download my library in its entirety (as was on the 7th gen) due to the weird queue downloads and lock-up this one experiences. It's almost as if the device is severely behind in system updates - yet it reports as being completely up to date.
--------
I traded in my beloved 7th gen for the new 10th. Double capacity, a tad extra light to read in the dark with (one of my *favorite* features). Other than those two bonuses, the 10th is a decided several steps backwards.

First one arrived the day after release - total lemon. No cushioning in the comparatively huge shipping box which may have contributed to its problems, the device was absurdly non-responsive, took nearly 10 minutes just to register basic info - and that was skipping all extras. After speaking with THREE customer service reps in India (srsly), I was instructed to return the device for an exchange. The next morning, a ""special team"" member began emailing me with instructions on how to return it on Amazon's dim. I re-packaged the reader in the same box it arrived in and dropped it off with UPS.

The next business day, my replacement arrived. This one proved to be much better than its unfortunate predecessor. However, the 10th gen still has what I consider to be puzzling issues. As mentioned by others, it is sluggish, especially when compared to the 7th. A page often needs to be swiped two or three times before anything happens. Downloading a single book is very fast, but anything more than three books queued causes catastrophic failure (refuse to dl or cherry-picks which ones it *does* download).

Whoever decided that reading a mere HALF HOUR A DAY is what the average purchaser of a purely reading device does really should rethink. The battery (even on the 7th) will NOT last ""weeks"", even if you do not use the light or read for more than a half hour a day. If you use the back light at all - one of the major advantages of the Paperwhite - your battery will drain in days, maybe a week, depending on how much you read. Today was the first time I've used the back light, and the battery is noticeably drained after only an *hour* with the light set relatively low.

Of course, now I can drop my reader in the bathtub or a pond for an hour, and theoretically it'll be fine. Whooptidoo.

Overall, I'm not impressed with the 10th gen. But I do love the Paperwhite in general. We have a seriously large 'real' library at home, and this adds over a thousand electronic volumes (so far) to it as well as the ability to check out library books to read at odd hours, while camping, etc. Except for the added storage, I almost wish I had my 7th gen back."
Cathy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thanks you for listening to me and for the update that fixed my concerns. Customer service still exists! This is my updated review
Blue,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my favorite kindle ever. I have owned a previous version of the paperwhite, the voyage, the first oasis (for a few days before I sent it back), and the new oasis with the 7” screen. This is by far my favorite.

I really liked the larger oasis when I first got it, but after awhile I got tired of the body style. I was tired of flipping the entire device every 2 minutes when I would switch hands (I didn’t realize how much I adjusted my grip until this device made me aware of it.) I also read in bed a lot and having practically no bottom bezel made the bottom of the page disappear into the pillow I would rest it on. Also while reading in bed it was more comfortable to grip the oasis on the top instead of the side to steady it, where there is almost no bezel. So that would lead to constantly accidentally opening the settings. I put up with it for the larger screen, water proofing, and the black and white invert.

This kindle paperwhite is the best of all worlds. The flush screen means debris can’t get trapped between the bezel and the screen, it’s waterproof, it has the black and white invert which is SUPER important to me because I have light sensitivity issues, it has a nice size bezel to hold onto any way you want, and the screen is plenty bright with no shadows at the bottom like the previous paper white version.

This device is hands down a five star product. The cases that amazon makes for it are wonderful too."
Phoebe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the kindle e-readers. Previously, I had the 7th generation that I bought back in 2013. You just can't beat the backlight with the kindle e-readers, they are the best on the market in my opinion.

I bought this mainly for the waterproof feature. It also has more storage space and some of the features (Goodreads, for example) have been updated. Another huge plus is having audiobooks on this kindle (though you do need a blu-tooth headphone set). I listen to a TON of audiobooks, so this is super useful for me. Also the 6 months of kindle unlimited doesn't hurt. The battery lasts much longer than my old paper white and as mentioned before, it is notably lighter than my old one.

For me, this was well worth the money because of the type of reader I am. The only minor gripe I would have is that sometimes I accidentally touch the screen and it goes on to the next page before I am done reading (an issue I had with the previous kindle paper white too), but it's a minor more logistical issue.

I think this generation came with a lot of improvements. The only real issue is that there are not a lot of cases available to go along with this e-reader (I found a gorgeous one that was a bit pricey), but if you're planning to use it near water then that might be for the best anyway.

Love this reader for sure! If you happen to have the money and are thinking about upgrading, I definitely recommend you do so."
gina,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before purchasing this product, I was using the Kindle App on my iPad Mini. Had it for two years before the app started to lag and crash starting a few weeks ago. I've had my eye on getting a Kindle for awhile and finally got around to purchasing the All-New Paperwhite with 32 GB. It's been several days since I've had it and I have to say, I'm totally impressed.

For someone like me who's an avid e-reader and has 4,000+ books in their Kindle account, this device is perfect for suiting their needs. FIrst of all, the display is gorgeous. I love how crisp the lettering is and how the pages actually look like real paper. There's barely any glare on the screen when held up in sunlight -- a huge advantage over the iPad Mini even with the light sensor it has built in. There's a very, very slight glare the ANPW gets when in direct sun, but it's easily rectified by changing the brightness of the screen or tilting it at a closer angle. It hasn't been a problem for me so far and I doubt it will be.

The same goes with the storage. I have over 4,000 books and have only used 5 GB out of the 32, and none of my books are audiobooks. Super encouraging to know that I could potentially triple my book count without the Kindle lagging because that was one of the main reasons I switched over from the App.

Another huge improvement is how LIGHT this device is. I have small hands and they'd get tired after a few hours of holding the iPad. But so far I've seen I can go all day holding the ANPW without experiencing any fatigue in my fingers or wrists -- that includes having a cover on it. And while I haven't had it long enough to test out whether the battery actually lasts for weeks, I will say that I've only charged it twice since receiving it and that wasn't because the battery was dead but simply because I wanted to. However, if I actually discover that the battery doesn't last for weeks like it's advertised to, I won't complain because it's still longer lasting than my iPad.

In general, this device is superior to the app as well as Nook products. I've had three different Nooks before switching over to Kindle and none of them were as easy to navigate as the ANPW is. With my Kindle, I can transition easily from reading, to the store to my goodreads account, and back to where I left off in a book. Nothing takes more than a second to load and I don't have to worry about getting lags in the process -- as I've experienced none so far. This device is everything I wanted to be and more. Has my entire Amazon/Kindle account installed including my wish list, goodreads, and store preferences easily loaded in once set-up is complete, not to mention all the storage, a great battery life (so far), and the best display I've seen on an e-reader to date. If you're looking at getting this Kindle as an upgrade from the App like I was, I bet you'll become as obsessed with this device as I have. 5+++++ stars and highly recommend!"
Chonto,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For me there’s no significant changes. I had the previous version and I think there’s no much difference that worth the money, even if you trade in. I don’t know why but I lost every word of every book I looked up.
The wake up is slow, and the software is basically the same, is not much faster than the previous one.
This review is made comparing both the new and the old paper white, but a have to say Kindle is an amazing device for those who like reading."
Omega Man,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say I am just not impressed with the quality of e-ink displays and readers after all this time. The main problem is that they are still so small. We should have e-readers the size of magazines for this same price by now. Instead, we still have e-readers the size of paperback books.

The “paperwhite” is better in terms of background color than older e-readers, but it is still not as white as paper.

Most of the time I would still rather use my iPad because it has a larger screen. I won’t return this item because it is not that bad, but it’s use is going to be limited to cases where the iPad isn’t convenient.

In addition to the small screen, it is sluggish. The cpu seems a little underpowered and the touch screen isn’t that responsive. Typing on it is difficult. Some of this no doubt has to do with the inherent sluggishness of e-ink displays but I think the cpu is also just a bit underpowered.

Overall the device only rates as “OK”. You will not be blown away by it and unless you’re in situations with a shortage of power, too much direct sunlight, or too much water around you may not find this worth using over a larger tablet that also runs other apps."
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't like using this tablet much. Its advantages are far outweighed by its disadvantages, which are numerous and annoying.

First, the advantages:
1. The screen is always ""on"". There is always something displayed on your screen, even when you're not using it. The light isn't always on, but the screen is always displaying something. This is due to the e-ink technology, which doesn't use any battery power to display the screen, only to change it. This is not much of an advantage, since when you're not using it, it just displays ads (if you buy the ""ad"" version, which is cheaper).
2. It has good battery life, but you can still drain it in a day by reading for hours.
3. It's water-resistant, so I guess you could read with it in the shower.

Now, the disadvantages.
1. The e-ink technology results in a display that might be easier on the eyes (I can't actually tell the difference), but it's very slow to refresh, and it's low resolution. Every time you change the page, the screen kind of flickers before the new page loads, which is annoying. Worse, it's a terrible way to shop for books. It's slow, you can't fit much on the screen, and it's not in color. Using the Kindle store on this device is just misery. I always just use another tablet or my computer to shop for books.
2. It has no web browser, or any other functionality other than an e-reader. I thought this would be fine, since it's dedicated to reading books, but I often find myself wanting to look something up that I'm reading in the book. I use another tablet for this, which before long makes you ask ""why don't I just use the other tablet for reading the book in the first place?""
3. It's expensive for what it does. You can buy a fully functional tablet, with color, a better screen and a web browser, for the same or less money.
4. Often I will buy a book and it won't show up on my Kindle. Strangely, it will show up on my phone's Kindle app, my other tablet's app, and the web, but not on this device. Why? I've gone days waiting for the book to show up in this device. Finally I had to reboot the device to get it to appear. This is just shoddy.
5. The low-priced version of this requires you to have ads on the device. This is really annoying. Every time you turn it off, an ad appears on the screen. While you're using it, other than when reading books, there are banner ads. Again, I find myself wondering why I don't just use the Kindle app on my tablet, which has no ads.

Conclusion: As an e-reader, it's ok, but not great. So there's no reason to have it. The screen may result in less eye strain, but if so, I can't tell. Just buy a tablet that has far more functionality and usefulness, and works better for reading books too."
SeferTech,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love to read. But often I would buy books for the Kindle app on my iPad and get about a quarter of the way through and I would stop. The purchased books would form a virtual pile up in the app as my bank account would dwindle and serve as a source of guilt for spending the money and not finishing what I started. But then I borrowed one of my kids Kindle's and gave it a try. The fact that it is just an e-reader is its main virtue. While reading, there are no pop-ups, no emails, no other electronic temptations to distract me from the pure joy and simply reading. At the same time, I rediscovered the library, well the electronic library and the ability to borrow e-books direct to my Kindle using the Libby app on my iPhone. Since this Kindle/Libby revelation I have read 4 novels (I am enjoying Dan Brown's books very much) in about 4-5 weeks. The library books are available for 21 days which puts a healthy pressure on me to read them in a timely manner. In this middle of all this the new Kindle Paperwhite 4 came out...I ordered it right away and actually use it as much for work (reading e-textbooks) during my commute as for novels at the gym. It is a great device - well made, highly functional, lightweight, and long lasting. I highly recommend this purchase."
Jared Belcher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned 5 Kindles and 2 Paperwhites, and this is certainly the best one yet. There isn't much to say - it's got an excellent screen that looks amazing in both sun and in the dark. The waterproofing seems to work very well. The battery is several weeks long. And it's the best looking Kindle Paperwhite yet. If you're buying a Kindle right now, this one is (nearly) the very best. The newest Oasis is arguably slightly nicer, but it's double the price. I think you'll love this Kindle and it'll be the one to get for the majority of people.

Do keep in mind that the 8GB model is MORE than sufficient if you're only reading on your Paperwhite (plus a few audiobooks). The 32GB is only necessary if you plan on storing a bunch of audiobooks on it at once, like more than 50. Since all of those are stored in the cloud anyway, it's likely that very few people need 32GB on their Kindle if you'd like to save a little money. Also on the audiobook thing - there is no headphone jack and there are no speakers, so you can only listen to audiobooks with wireless headphones or a Bluetooth speaker. Not a big deal, just good to know beforehand!"
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was excited to have an e-reader that I could store multiple books on for trips and vacations rather than lugging around multiple books. The paperwhite turned out to be clunky to navigate and use. It often would not respond to commands. It was not intuitive in the least. Worst of all, there are endless advertisements constantly showing up. I understand getting ads when you are using a free product. But why should I be bombarded with them on a device and service I'm paying for??? Finally, the paperwhite crapped out all together and got stuck in the waking mode after 4 months. It is now unusable. I've tried a hard reset several times (apparently this is a common problem) but that did not work. I would like to replace it (It only has a 1 month return policy - why is that? Because its garbage and they cannot back up their product?) Amazon did not list the replacement link on my Order List. I will now spend the morning digging around the internet trying to figure out how to get Amazon to replace it. But first, I wanted to forewarn buyers how disappointing this devise is. Perhaps other e-readers are better. This one feels like a dinosaur and like it hasn't been improved upon since its conception. It didn't last even 6 months with light use! The only benefit was the non-reflective screen. Otherwise, a complete waste of money. FYI - we have 3 kindle fires. They have lasted years. I should have just stuck with those devices and enjoyed the benefit of a web browser, reading apps, audible app, music, NO ADS, and best of all kindle fire works unlike the paperwhite."
Samantha,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I held out on getting a Kindle for a long time, and grudgingly gave in because I am doing a lot of travel this summer. I have to admit, I'm impressed. I enjoyed it way more than I expected. After the first couple of pages, the format as opposed to a physical book really didn't bother me. One big pro is the portability - I can have a book in my purse all the time, which is great with any unexpected travel delays and so on. I got myself a stand-case as well, so I can read while blowdrying my hair or doing just about anything else, and I only occasionally need to take one finger and touch the screen - no juggling while I try to turn the page, hold the book open, etc. For a major reader like me, it's huge being able to take advantage of every second of reading time!

I only have two complaints: One is the on-device format for my wishlist - it doesn't let me sort out things that have moved onto Unlimited, and I can't sort by lowest price the way I can on Amazon proper. Second, it doesn't except books from Cloud Library, the e-book service my local library offers. When I wrote in a complaint, I got a form letter back saying that's my library's problem, not Amazon's. Pretty sure the mega-corporation will be better able to handle expanding acquisitions than my little local library..."
RPD New Jersey,1.0 out of 5 stars,Just received the new waterproof Kindle today. I charged it up and put it next to my Voyage. The new Kindle had a yellowish screen with a little glare where as my 2015 Voyage had a crystal clear screen bright white and easy to read. I tried to make some screen adjustments on the new Kindle but could never get it even close to the Voyage. The new Kindle and leather cover I also bought seemed very cheap compared to the Voyage. When I was done with my side by side comparison I packaged up the new Kindle and new cover and shipped it back to Amazon for a full refund. Proving once again that new is not always better!
Bimal,1.0 out of 5 stars,"What's there to like? It's the same Kindle, lighter and thinner. My old Kindle worked just fine. The upgrade Scheme is totally not worth it."
jkesmom2,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried to love it. This was my 6th kindle and my 3rd paperwhite. I thought I had found way around most of the CONs: lighting issues, (close your eyes until your lighting adjustment registers so you aren't blinded), reading lists issues, (use only my reading list feature to avoid small screen clutter), power button on bottom shutting off, (use cover protector to elevate kindle to it doesn't turn off when resting on bottom button or use landscape.) I tried everything I could think of but could not prolong the battery life. However, no matter what I do, there is no way to make the battery life better than the older generation paperwhite kindle. That Kindle will go to sleep if I fall asleep. This one will NOT. I charged this new one and fell asleep with it on. I woke up with it on the same page and spot. I had previously turned my wifi off as I thought this might preserve the battery. However, just 16 hours after my kindle was fully charged, it was DEAD. So back it went. I bought the new one for the battery life because I read 40+ hours a week. What I really need is a non glare tablet because a kindle oasis is too expensive for so little screen size upgrade."
Don Cajone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to agree with many people here. The newer the model the more problems. Must be shaving off quality for profits. Pathetic. The batteries are AWFUL and do not last hardly at all. MUCH LESS than older kindle models. I guess now there's a user base then quality is expected but not delivered.
Download speed? Ughhh. I tried to download my library of about 400 books (gonna be used where there's not always an WiFi) and 4 days later is hasn't done more than 300. It does 10-20 at a time them stops, stalls, etc. Sending from Amazon account does no good.
I'm certainly going to look for a competitor. Just like many other things Amazon is going downhill in the pursuit or domination."
Kelly Pavich,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon - I am disappointed. This same product was listed a few days after I purchased it for $50 less and you wouldn't honor that price difference for a long-standing prime member. Your team told me to return my Kindle and reorder it, but that takes up valuable time for a working mom who bought it because of a vacation. There is NO time to return it and start over. Just practice good best practices and honor the price reduction, esp. For a valued customer. This is beneath you and your tenets."
LinaRi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"**LONG HONEST REVIEW**

This is the second kindle I’ve ever owned. I had bought the Kindle Fire when it first came out years ago and HATED it. I vowed never to buy another kindle and decided to download the free kindle app on my other devices instead.

My main issue with reading on the kindle app on my Apple devices is that there is so much glare. It makes it pretty much impossible to read at the beach or anywhere where you’re getting a lot of sunlight. My iPad and iPhone would overheat when reading outside at the beach or the pool, so I pretty much gave up on that.

This year, I am traveling to many different countries and have been reading more than I have ever been. I did not want to take physical books with me on trips for the obvious reason that it takes up space and weighs down my luggage. That’s when I decided to see about the kindle paper white.

My sister in law has a previous version (one without the back lights) and told me how she really enjoyed it. I decided to go ahead and order one for myself (the newest generation).

Man, am I pleasantly surprised by this device. It’s compact, portable, really minimizes glare, and the backlight is phenomenal for reading in different lighting. In fact, I can now read in the dark without keeping my husband awake with a reading light. With that being said, there are something’s that I found in the reviews to be misleading.

1. Battery Life: battery life on this device is phenomenal. When I first received the kindle I fully charged it. I have been reading on my kindle since last week for hours at a time and have yet to charge it again. It’s currently at 76% and it started at 100%.
With that being said, if you’re reading with the backlight on constantly the battery is not going to last as long because (obviously) the backlight will use more energy.

2. Anti-Glare: I’m actually really surprised how many people comment and complain about the anti-glare on this device. If you hold the kindle under direct light of course you’re going to get a slight glare, it’s not a book, it’s a device with a screen. The glare on the device is absolute minimal and haven’t noticed it when I’m actively reading. I only notice it when I’m picking it up to read.

3. Water-Resistance: I would absolutely avoid submerging this device (or any other water resistent devices). I have not tested the water resistance, nor will I purposely do so as the water may not do damage internally but externally to the device (i.e., the charging port WILL rust). I would definitely take this to the beach or the pool with me and am not worried at all about spilling stuff on it or touching it with wet hands.

4.Finger print resistance: I’m not really going to comment on this. Nothing is truly finger print resistent and if it bothers you carry a cleaning cloth with you.

I love having the ability to buy books right off of my kindle and being able to read them right away. I’m so glad that I purchased this device. I don’t have to drain my phone battery reading on the kindle app, my husband can now sleep while I’m awake reading, and my luggage doesn’t have to weigh a million pounds while I travel country to country."
P. Falle,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to try a kindle instead of my phone or an iPad. I ordered the new paperwhite thinking that being a 10th generation product the bugs would be worked out. I had multiple things that didnt work. 1. Battery life was not weeks, it was days. even with the screen turned off, each time it was turned on the battery was 10% than the time prior. 2. It froze...all of the time. After reading one or two pages it would completely lock up and I would have to reboot by holding the power button down in order to unfreeze it. 3. I had to factory reset it multiple times in order to try and fix it (per Amazons support) . 4. It re-booted itself when it want freezing. I tried multiple things. I must have just had a defective unit, but I am done for not with trying. I wanted to like this in the worst way for traveling because its so light and compact, but I am going to have to wait 10 more generations so they can fix these issues. I gave it two stars instead of one because the support rep I spoke to was awesome, and it was not their fault the unit did not function."
Elleabee,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently traded in my older Paperwhite for the new one. I am incredibly disappointed in the new one. The more I use it, the more disappointed I am. Here is what I have noticed so far:
1. The battery life is HORRIBLE compared to my old one. I used to use my old one for weeks. My new one only lasts a day. Extremely disappointing and not worth the upgrade.
2. It takes longer to turn on than my old one. Not a huge deal but definitely annoying. I used to hit power then swipe. Now I hit power then wait several seconds then I can open it.
3. It overheated VERY quickly. I live in FL and do a lot of reading in the sun. My old Kindle never overheated. This one did within an hour.
If you have an older paper white I would advise against upgrading at all. I wish I had my old one back 😢"
J. F. Hindy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So my gf bought me a base model first gen Kindle Touch the year they came out for Christmas and, honestly, it still works to this day and all I've needed is a book light to attach to the top for night reading. However, that same gf decided that it was time I got an upgrade to this thing I use almost every evening.

The difference between the two is staggering.

Pros
1. The 300ppi is more than enough for what I need it for. Everything looks good.
2. The light goes from barely there to surprisingly bright.
3. It's lighter, thinner, and easier to hold in one hand versus my first gen kindle.
4. Battery life is pretty good. You can tank it quickly when you're using the wifi a lot but once you get books downloaded and are just reading, it lasts for a good, long time.
5. The back matte material is smooth and enjoyable to touch.
6. It stores all of my books without issue.
7. Most of the extras can be turned off. For instance, I don't really use Goodreads so I turned it all off and it's like it's not there.
8. Having thumbnails of the books instead of just titles is really nice.
9. It's much faster and more responsive than my first gen kindle.
10. The Bluetooth feature for audible audio books is nice. I finally listened to the Bruce Campbell autobiography I got for free that one time.

Neutral
1. The ""with offers"" isn't annoying at all. You only see ads on the lock screen and not while reading. I'm cool with that, but it's also not a good thing. Good way to save $20.

Cons
1. Still uses a micro USB port for charging. Everything is moving to USB-C and it would've been nice to see the Kindle modernize that last little bit. It's not a huge deal because it comes with its own cable, but it's a second cable on my night stand which remains from my previous Kindle.
2. A headphone jack would've been nice too. The Bluetooth works great for speakers and most modern cars, but a headphone jack would've made it work with everything. Not a huge deal because it's an ereader and not a smartphone (which should also have them imho), but still, this is a cons section.

Overall, I'm very happy. The crisp words and customizable backlight make my night reading a lot less intrusive to both me and my gf. She doesn't have to deal with a book light that never dims low enough to not light up the room and I can adjust it down far enough to never have eye fatigue. It holds all my books, connects to wifi easily, and it's just so much faster and more responsive overall than my ancient Kindle Touch.

I do wish it has USB-C charging because then I could just re-use my phone charger for it on days when it needs charged (which isn't very frequently). Having to keep another wall plug + cable around just for the Kindle is a bit of a pain in a 2019 full of wires. However, I am already used to this thanks to my previous Kindle Touch so it's not like a ""woe is me"" moment or anything.

TL;DR

Could use USB-C and a headphone jack, but otherwise this is an outstanding e-ink ereader and one I will readily recommend to others without hesitation."
Shoppermom,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved, loved, loved my original Kindle - either the first one ever or the 2009 version, I'm not sure which. The buttons worked, the Whispersync worked, and the ability to buy without wifi was wonderful. And then I dropped it, and ever since then I've been disappointed. I DO like my Kindle Fire, but I was hoping the Paperwhite would be more convenient on a day-to-day basis. So I bought one and hated it. I took advantage of the ""trade-in"" when this one came out, hoping it would be more appealing. I didn't read the fine print well enough, and assumed the blah-blah-blah about audio meant there were speakers and a jack for earbuds, but there aren't. I know I can buy bluetooth earbuds, but I don't really want to. I find the home screen set-up and even the library page set-up very displeasing, and I can't even tell you why. And I hate, hate, hate turning pages on it or manoeuvring to or from a book to the homepage or the library (no improvement at all from the one I turned in). If they put out a Kindle ""Classic,"" I'd buy it in an instant!"
Kelli Jaynes,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, I like this devise; it's light weight, fits in my hand, and is easy to use. However, since is read a lot and have MS, I like to put the devise on a little stand rather than hold it all the time. Since the power switch is on the bottom, every time the devise gets bumped it turns off. I wish I had returned it within the return period of time. If it weren't for this problem, I would give it 5 stars."
Air1x,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you do the comparison of the kindle vs. kindle paperwhite on Amazon's page, it clearly shows the paperwhite has wifi & cellular connectivity. So I purchased this for my 84 year old Mother who has no wifi service to replace her 3rd generation. But this has no cellular connectivity when delivered. Amazon cust. svc. says you have to purchase a different paperwhite which is $100 more. I challenge anyone to try to buy a paperwhite from the Amazon website and see anywh"
D. Zarka,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So this Paperwhite is probably my 4th Kindle - I am addicted to my Kindle so when my beloved Voyage stopped charging (may it rests in peace) I ordered a new Kindle the same day. Voyage aren't done anymore so I thought the new and improved Paperwhite (love the water resistant feature) would be a wonderful replacement... it's OK but not as good as my old faitful Voyage was. First of all, and I know it's a detail, the screen takes a tad longer to switch on (""waking up"" it tells me), the backlight isn't as strong and that makes a difference on a beach (where I can thankfully be every week end), and the battery seems to drain faster too (and yes, I am staying in flight mode). With all of that, I'll live, I know, but still, I was kind of hoping that 4 years after Voyage, the Paperwhite would be as good. It's not, it's good enough, not good.

so when is the next Voyage out?"
Katie,2.0 out of 5 stars,"1. Wake up takes FOREVER - A major change was made with this version. The Kindle now needs to ""wake up"" before you can swipe to your home screen. And it takes forever. Before when you pressed the button, it would wake up almost instantly, and then you could then swipe. Now, you have to turn it on and waiiiiiiiiiit. When it finally decides to wake up you can THEN swipe to get to your library. If it's going to take that long, it really ought to automatically go to your home screen so you're not having to push the button and sit there staring at it until you're allowed to swipe. Super frustrating. Oh, also, the wake up screen doesn't obey your brightness settings, so if you're turning it on in a dark room, be prepared for momentary blindness

2. Downloads don't automatically show up in Library - When you go to the store, or search a book from the cloud that hasn't been downloaded, you click to download and go back to your homepage/library. The book it supposed to just show up. It never does. It'll say ""downloading"" but you can wait all you want, it won't show up. You have to click away to another page, and then click back to get it to show up. This is annoying, the old Paperwhite if you clicked ""download"" and went back to home, it'd just show up after a minute. Now it doesn't. Seems like a really poor user experience to tell the user ""this will appear in your library"" only to have it not appear until you DO something like click around to get the page to refresh.

3. Options - The new Paperwhite doesn't allow all the customizations previous versions did. The biggest annoyance for me is that I can't turn off highlighting and dictionary. I don't need a dictionary. I do however need it to stop DEFINING words for me when I accidentally hit the screen. As someone who dozes off while reading at night, I am constantly waking up to the @#$@#$ dictionary screen defining whatever word my thumb has accidentally hit like ""the"". I don't need ""the"" defined. I also really dislike highlighting, everytime I accidentally do it, it dumps a new book in my library called ""clippings"" i don't know who's using this feature, but it's not me and I used to be able to turn it off.

4. Can't delete User Guides. Please tell me why I need a copy of every single user guide for all versions of the Paperwhite in my Kindle? And if I do have to have them, why I can't I at least remove them from the Kindle? Does anyone read these?? Is there some writer out there that's so proud of them he insists they be included and not able to be removed unless someone logs in via computer to the amazon account, tracks it down and removes it, only to be replaced by a new one every time there an update?

The Kindle is overly engineered. They took a great product... and messed with it. They added way too much stuff so it's slow, didn't test it so it's buggy, and locked it down so users can't customize it. Do yourself a favor, keep your old Kindle.

5. Font - you used to be able to select font. Maybe it's been gone awhile (my old Kindle is OLD) but this was a great feature. Some fonts are easier to read, sometimes you just get bored and wanna change things up.

6. Doesn't turn off automatically. If you fall asleep reading, be prepared to wake up to that light still on, that also drains the battery.

7. The battery life is worse than previous versions (wasn't it supposed to be better?)"
harley,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so happy this kindle is waterproof so I can read in the tub without worry about the little splashes! That said, I miss my older kindle (two years old) which was also back lit but had a much better mechanism for turning the page back and forth. With this kindle I can only turn the page forward on the right side of the screen and back on the left, but sometimes I am holding the kindle with my left hand and would prefer to be able to turn the page forward from there. The last kindle I owned, had pressure sensitive ""buttons"" on both the right and left of the screen to go backwards and forwards. They were not buttons as much as places on the screen that were sensitive to pressure. This was a much more accurate way of page turning as well as often now the highlighting and the page turning feature gets messed up. Missing my old kindle...."
Stephen Sedmak,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Mixed feelings vs. my previous generation Kindle Paperwhites.

Pros: waterproof, more even lighting, can fully shut-off light, more neutral light color
Cons: Light too bright for night use, less comfortable to hold, randomly high bright flashes

I do like that the light color is more grey/yellow vs. my older Paperwhites which emit a blue-ish light.

The biggest negative for me with the 10th gen is that the light simply won't go dim enough for reading in the dark before it shuts off (0). Even after inverting black/white (!), the 10th gen Paperwhite on its dimmest lit setting (1) still puts out far more light than my older Paperwhites on their dimmest setting (0).

On top of that, the brightness randomly flashes much brighter than the current setting when redrawing the screen. It settles back to the assigned setting before it's done, but this is highly annoying at night. Also, the inverted black/white sometimes seems to draw with normal white/black for a second before inverting them, which again doesn't work well at night.

I like to read my paperwhite in bed while trying to fall asleep, and this just won't work for me at all.

The screen lighting is much more even than older Paperwhites, so that is an improvement. It's just too dang bright at night.

Other people comment that the maximum bright setting isn't as bright as older generations. I haven't observed that issue, but I can't expect any screen light to keep up with direct sunlight. That's what the e-ink display is for. Perhaps it's an issue with people not appreciating the ""warmer"" color temperature?

During daylight, you can get better battery life by shutting the light off completely, but battery life was never a problem for me with the older Paperwhites anyway.

Also, I find the 10th gen Paperwhite less comfortable to hold in my hand. Perhaps some future silicone or rubber case may alleviate this concern. Lackluster availability of cases is understandable for a brand-new product.

On the plus side, I love the waterproof feature - the only water resistant case I ever liked was the discontinued Incipio Atlas. All the others I tried were terrible.

I'll probably end up using my 10th gen for travel, but keep my older Paperwhites for nightly use."
dah_NEES,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my “All-new Kindle Paperwhite” for two days. I have an original Kindle Paperwhite I purchased in 2012 but I bought the new one because it had text-to-speech. My eyes don’t always read well because of eyestrain from working on a computer all day but I love to read and I also love to listen text-to-speech to avoid further eyestrain. I have been shopping for the perfect Kindle reader and I tried the Kindle Fire HD. I found that the HD to be too large and heavier then a Paperwhite although there text-to-speech is better.

My original Kindle Paperwhite didn’t have text-to-speech which is why I decided to purchase a new one. I finally settled on the “All-new Kindle Paperwhite” but I’m sorely disappointed in its text-to-speech. I hadn’t realized that I can only do text-to-speech with Bluetooth headsets. I read and listen to books while I drive to work every day. I don’t listen to music I listen to books. I also wanted to avoid headphones because using headphones every day for well over twenty years is no longer good for my ears. Every day headphone use has caused many ear issues. The text-to-speech on the “All-new Kindle Paperwhite” is good but it would be better if the text-to-speech would only speak for the books. The Kindle text-to-speech for the menu item, the double tapping to select, and the clicking noise when changing the page is very annoying.

Amazon needs to update their text-to-speech software for the Kindle Paperwhite. And allow the use of text-to-speech without headphones. I would return it but I still need a text-to-speech Kindle and since this one appears to be my only option I will probably have to keep it even though I’m not completely satisfied.

UPDATE: This All-new Kindle Paperwhite was not bad, I love the size and weight. Of course, there are a few minor issues like the battery is not the same as my original Kindle Paperwhite and the size is slightly smaller so I cannot use the same Kindle case. The real problem is what I purchased it for, the text-to-speech. As mention in my original review above, I need the text-to-speech for the books only and not the home screen or menu items. For that reason, I am returning the All-new Kindle Paperwhite. As I am desperate for a text-to-speech e-reader I will continue my Kindle search, but I will visit local stores that sell them to get a better view and compare to see which Kindles have the best text-to-speech."
D.C.A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is exactly what I was looking for in an ereader. I have owned several variants of Kindles over the years, and I think this is by far the best I could have asked for. The waterproofing is great, the size and weight are just right, and the screen is so clear and vibrant. Again, I couldn't have asked for a better Kindle than this one here."
JB Finswagle,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So I ordered this item as a gift for my wife WHO IS ON MY FAMILY PRIME ACCOUNT. When the device arrived, we were unable to get the promotions that came with it (6 months unlimited Kindle store access and a $5 credit) to work with it hooked up to the device if we wanted it to say her name when we turned it on. Instead, the Amazon reps said we had to return the opened device and order a new one. When I ordered the new one, it didn't come with the promotional credits. This all comes after wasting literally an hour on the phone with the Amazon people to sort through the issue. Does this sound wrong/uneconomical to anyone else?"
Niko Bellic,1.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I receive the device and the cable simply will not plug into it. Okay fine. Nothing is perfect right? So I decide to push on. The device seemed to work properly and I was off reading like a mad man.

Then a week in, I notice the device goes from 80% charge to completely drained with wifi turned off and in sleep mode. What? Seriously? A brand new release and the device can't hold a charge? I put my negativity aside and contacted Amazon support. They helped me troubleshoot the problem which ended in getting a new cable (one that actually plugs into the device without forcing it) and also how to properly restart it. Followed all the instructions and really hoped I was on my way to a 5-star review.

But alas, it was not meant to be. The battery drain has continued well past 5 restarts and the device simply will not hold a charge. Now I know why Jeff Bezos is so rich - selling devices that aren't ready for prime time (Amazon Prime time, haha) to millions of people. This device is simply not made properly. You should not have to troubleshoot a brand new device as if it's 10 years old and starting to fail. Never mind the fact that page turning has a distinctive lag. I mean, come on. Its sole purpose is to view text. Text! But Amazon couldn't be bothered to put any kind of decent processor in the thing that would make page turning instant and crisp.

One last attempt to resolve with Amazon support and these were the options I was given:

1. Receive a 15% discount on a new device AND NOT be able to return the faulty device! I literally laughed when I was told this. How does that resolve my problem? Unless my problem is a bizarre need to give Jeff Bezos more of my money for nothing in return.
2. Return the device for a full refund - um, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that Amazon's regular return policy? The whole point is I want a Kindle to read with. Appreciate getting my money back, but I'd be without a Kindle.

Totally lame! Not falling for the Kindle ever again. Better off reading from my iPhone!"
Dal Winslow,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Works fine but I would suggest the 'swipe to unlock' feature be changed to an option. I prefer the older version where all I had to do is open the cover and start reading. On the new software, you need to swipe to get it unlocked, plus it shows new books on the same page. For a person that is not that computer savvy, it is easy to miss the swipe and pull in a new book that you do not want. This is also more difficult for the senior readers."
John Blair,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was one of those hard core readers who refused to give up on the feel of a real book. Once I gave in though there's been no turning back. I love the Kindle and I've now owned several. Since I now own the newest version out I have some complaints about things I think should have been better designed by now. One area is the system fonts. In a book there's numerous ways to change the size of the text you're reading, though it still doesn't work so well with PDFs. Getting into the Kindle's own system menus though reguires me to have a pair of glasses on hand to read those non-negotiable font sizes. Then there's the dictionary. I think by now there should be an easy way to use the dictionary recursively-finding definitions for words within definitions your already looking up to whatever level you need to go. There's no easy way I've been able to do that on any kindle.
I read reviews from people who left a single star review solely because this new Kindle doesn't have a USB - C port. I'm no electronic engineer but I know enough to know that it's primarily to carry more current which could reguire larger components and pathways which IBBELIEVE would make for a larger heavier Kindle. Although one awesome aspect would be the ease of use as it's so much easier to insert."
Nancy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so disappointed. I truly enjoy my Kindle reader and was excited to order one that was waterproof mistakenly assuming that it would be as great as the one I had and have more. Downloading books that I had on my previous Kindle is a royal pain, the lighting is much worse, there is virtually no technical support. It comes with a cord that doesn't work.

I had 600+ books on my current paperwhite, to put them on this ""new version"" you have to individually download them - Sync doesn't work with your previous books only with the book you have currently open - UGH

I was so excited that I didn't wait for the Christmas sale - when they didn't go on sale on black Friday I called and was told since it was new it wouldn't go on sale this year so I went ahead and bought. This morning they are on sale - go figure.

The biggest issue for me is my disappointment that Amazon would put out such an inferior product when the previous version was so well made and worked so well.

Wait to purchase until they fix the problems"
Rich Depro,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great little device, I bought a Nook several years before I purchased this because I like Barns and Nobel and really enjoy book stores, but I liked the readability of the paper white. So I used my Nook and it was ok, I will still use it as it's a neat little device for reading, surfing the web etc. But I love the paper white implementation, wow! It feels like you are reading an actual printed book; I love that! Also this thing is so light, my color Nook was nice but if you had to hold it up to your face and read for a while, longer than say 15 minutes, the weight would start making my wrists and hands sore; but this Kindle I can read for hours without any issue to my wrists or arms. The images a crisp and clear and the adjustments to the contrast are easy to use but don't burn out my eyes when I need a little more light for reading. Flipping pages, going to another book, or purchasing a book is super simple. All in all this thing is really a nice reading device."
Jakenbates,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to get a new Kindle reader I picked the paper white kindle, because everything I read about it sounded pretty good. My old one was a 2nd generation, and come to find out it was 9 years old. There is a real learning curve fo me, and it is very frustrating. Every day I try to learn one thing new on how to work it. So far I know how to buy a book, still can’t find my archives, are the books that I have already paid for and was going to read. I guess I was spoiled with my old one where I could just go to home and all of my books to be read were there waiting for me. Also I could just go to the archive and find all the books that I had read, since I had bought my first kindle.
I want to know how all things work with this new Kindle, but am have a heck so a time trying to find what it is I am to find out."
Angela M. Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had two older models of Kindle readers close to 10 years ago, and since then I have used my iPad and my iPhone 7 to read before bedtime. I started to realize that the iPhone was causing my eyes to get dry and fatigued, and looked at getting a new Kindle to read. I’m so glad I did, and could kick myself for not doing it sooner.

They are far smaller (in weight and bulk, not screen size) than the older models, and I like the built-in light. The only bummer about the light is that to get the one that auto-adjusts to the ambient lighting, I think you have to spring for the Oasis, which is considerably more expensive. That’s a small inconvenience, though. I just adjust the brightness as needed.

I got the one with “special offers,” after reading online reviews, since nearly everyone said it was worth the savings, since the ad content only shows when the Kindle is in sleep mode.

I also opted for the 32Gb version because I prefer not to have to constantly download books, especially if I’m traveling and WiFi is sketchy.

I’m so happy I got this"
mstax,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it! I have been reading my Kindles for approximately 12-14 years and the 10 is awesome! It is about one to two inches shorter that the others, I love the leather cover (very glad I spent the extra $20 to upgrade!), the corners on the cover are rounded to keep them from tearing. The new Kindle has several changes - I haven't mastered all of them yet, but most are an improvement over the previous Kindles. The only complaint so far is when you open the book to the front page (where I keep my folders with certain books in them) is not on the first page. You have to go to the three dots at the top right of the page and go to ""Your Library"" (at least it's the first item on the list) to get to the folders you have set up. I liked being able to open ""Home"" and have my folders right there. If there is a way around this, I haven't found it, and nobody at Kindle has been able to help me change it to be like I want it. Other than that small item (which probably won't bother most people), I would highly recommend getting the new 10. I also didn't realize you can get a car charger ($66 from Amazon, but I found one on Amazon from another individual - which was brand new for $9.99 - HUGE difference in price!) The plug from your old Kindle works just fine with the new 10 Kindle - if you don't purchase the bundle, you don't need a new one. I don't like that you cannot purchase a bundle where you don't need WiFi...in order to upgrade and purchase items separately, it would have raised the price by $133 - a bit pricy I think. I would have liked to have the one that doesn't need WiFi, but settled for the one that needs WiFi and will keep plenty of books downloaded in my folders so when we are traveling, I don't need to use WiFi. I think the difference in price of the Kindle (wifi vs no wifi) should be the amount to upgrade to a bundle with one that doesn't need wifi). But for $133, I just couldn't justify or afford the no wifi version. Great book and it's a lot lighter (just a few grams in weight, but noticeable, since the book is smaller and fits easier into my purse. I would have given it a 5 star rating, but there are a few things that I didn't like (mentioned above)."
Christopher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this as a gift for my GF. She reads a few books a month and was very skeptical about switching from physical copies to eBooks. However, she really loves this! She likes that it tells her exactly how far she is in the book and her estimated time till completion. She also likes that it automatically syncs to her good reads account so she can quickly add, buy, or mark books as read to her various lists. She also says that the battery life is great, rarely needing a charge!

Now I want one too!!"

Hobbit,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a big fan of Kindle. In fact I have three! But I wanted one that would easily switch from visual reading to Audible Audiobooks. For example, I had hoped that if I was in the middle of a chapter but had to go out somewhere, I would be able to switch from printed word to audible that I could listen to through bluetooth in the car. Even though they are advertised to sync with Audible Audiobooks, Paperwhite Kindles don't. I spent hours (NO exaggeration) on the phone with Kindle help. When they couldn't get it to work, they thought the Kindle must be broken and sent me a replacement. I decided to contact Audible Audiobooks before I even opened the replacement Kindle, and Audible told me that Paperwhite does NOT sync and that I should use my iPhone or other device. Needless to say, I returned the replacemtnt Kindle unopened since I already have 3!!!
It seems odd that Audible doesn't sync with Amazon Kindle since Amazon is its parent company, but that indeed seems to be the case. So if you just want a reader, then Paperwhite is a fine choice. But if you're looking for audible, choose something else...iPhone works great."
Jessica Gurganus,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love love love this Kindle!! Would give it 5 stars but the power cable wouldnt fit in the charging port. I had to purchase another one.
GamerGirl,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My Voyager died and I replaced it with this. On par with Voyager and cheaper, and I like it better than my husband's Oasis. Oasis was too wide and slippery for me. I only miss the squish to turn pages of the Voyager, but a tap is OK. I really like the slightly rubberized case. Overall it has been great.
DISLIKES: 1) Power switch is at the bottom, so I set it down at an angle to read at the table and it turns off. Top center would make more sense. 2) The page turning option can't be switched. As a lefty, I'd like to have the page advance with a left tap/swipe rather than right side only. Option to swap forward/backward (or double up like the Voyager had) would be great."
Andrew Ryan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally had enough with B&N and bought a Kindle instead. I’ve owned 2 previous Nooks as well as used my wife’s older Kindle Paperwhite, and this is the nicest ereader I’ve ever used. I use it daily and think Amazon hit the mark for the most part with this device.

Pros:
The flush, sealed screen is much higher quality than my Nook. Some of the images make it look like there is glare but I don’t find this to be a major issue. The backlight is also much more even than my Nook. Waterproofing is a nice to have but it probably won’t come in to play for me too often. I do love that audiobook support was added. Some people won’t use it, personally I do, I think it’s a nice feature. If you are going to use it for audiobooks I highly recommend the additional storage model (I have the 32GB - for some reason Amazon put on my review I have the 8). Screen refresh times are better than my Nook as well. All in all I think this device approaches everything that I’d desire in an ereader.

Cons:
There are 2 major things missing that I don’t personally care much about but I know a lot of people do: immersion reading (simultaneous audio and text) and comfort lighting to reduce blue light at night. Whether you’ll ever get all of these features in the mid grade Kindle is unclear. I would like to think at the least, Amazon might incorporate these into the Oasis in the future. Realistically, they have so much market share I’m not sure they really feel obligated to deliver on every feature.

Some people may also miss physical page turn buttons. While I do a little bit, I like the clean look and feel of this device even more. Some people have commented turning pages without the buttons is hard - I have to disagree. Maybe I just have a different definition of “difficult” - I’ve never had an issue.

Some complaints about this device got pretty ridiculous - like complaining it didn’t function more like a tablet - but a tablet. As a stand-alone reader, which is what most avid readers are looking for, this device does what it needs to do. Goodreads integration is nice but I don’t want all the social media connectivity and all of that anyways, it’s just a distraction from reading.

I know some people have also had issues with pinhole bright spots - hopefully Amazon will replace those units and iron out any production issues, since that would be irritating. Every ereader with a backlight I’ve seen is pretty susceptible to light layer damage so I always recommend a sturdy case, espescially with the flush screen on the new Kindle.

All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who wants a true ereader. I think it’s the best option out there and that’s even more true if you use Audible or Kindle Unlimited."
Jack Schnabel,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This kindle does everything you'd expect it to, and it does it well. The e-ink display truly does look like words on a page, and is very easy on the eyes. Paired with the design of the device, this truly is the best reading experience you can have, in my personal opinion. You can hold it in any position without having to deal with pages awkwardly flopping around or causing shadows. Additionally, you can store hundreds or even thousands of books all in the palm of your hand.

I loved my old kindle touch (4th generation), and my dad loved his normal kindle (4th gen). That's why I recently decided that it's time for an upgrade. Both of us are avid readers, so why not make the experience even better? I purchased a 9th generation Kindle Oasis for myself, and this 10th generation kindle paperwhite for my father. Long story short, he hates it.

Allow me to explain a bit. The core kindle experience is still there, and it's just as strong as ever (although the software has gotten more confusing and less simple and intuitive as more features have been added). The problem that my father had (and I agree with completely) is that the display is, simply put, inconsistent. It's not ""paperwhite"" like it's advertised as, it's actually the same muted grayish color as the older kindles, and the whiteness comes from the lighting. That's fine and all, expect that the lighting is inconsistent. Some parts of the screen are brighter than others, and some areas often appear hazy compared to the rest of the display. Additionally, small areas (about 1/4 and inch wide) sometimes pop up where the text appears significantly darker than the surrounding text, as though it's bolded (when I know that it's not). I could sort of ""massage it out"" by rubbing that spot firmly, and it would go away. The backlight is very blue as well, and makes the entire screen look washed out. All of these things together make this display horrid to use. At a glance it doesn't seem too bad at all, but when you really sit down to read it becomes very distracting and ruins part of the immersion that a kindle provides.

I know that I am not just being picky because I have seen and used friends paperwhites, and never have I seen this issue. It is for that reason that I am giving this product 2 stars still, as opposed to one. I am certain that I have gotten a defective unit, and am going to return it as such. My dad has decided that it's not worth the trouble and that his old kindle has never done him wrong, and so he is going to stick with that. The build quality on the older ones is much better anyway, the new ones are just plastic. I would have bumped this entire rating up to 3 stars if the display was actually paperwhite, and not just reliant on a battery-draining low quality light to make it appear ""white.""

Would I recommend this? Seeing as my unit was defective, that it tough to say. I've seen a lot of other reviews on ALL of the newer kindles about issues with the screen. I'd have to go with a hesitant yes, I would recommend this product, but be aware of the common issues with the screen. If you do end up having issues, return the device. Such issues are unacceptable in a product you pay for with your hard earned money."
Mumzard,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The selling point that made me purchase was the invert colors. In bed I like a black background with light text to make the screen darker. The first problem is that you don't get a black background, it's a Grey that pushes a lot of light. In comparison, my Samsung tablet gives a true black background.

The real show stopper is that the paperwhite flashes the other inverted color for every page or menu change before loading the correct one. So, when you change a page at night it flashes the white version prior to loading the black one. The opposite is also true. If you have a white background, it flashes the black version prior to loading the white one. I guess this is really showing how truly slow the device is. In any event it is very distracting."
Jason H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded from the 6th Generation (2014), I'm loving this All-New Kindle Paperwhite!!

- The size is a little smaller than the previous model. When I tried to use the leather cover from the old model, it didn't fit at all. The old model cover runs big. I got the all-new water-resistant fabric cover for this model and it feels fantastic!

- The front is one single panel, and the edges are now flat with the screen. At first, it feels weird to turn pages since the old model had a physical edge (higher than the screen). After getting used to it, it feels more smooth and more convenient to operate.

- I traded in my old Kindle and used the promotion to get the 32GB memory version (the appraised trade-in value gift card+25% off+6mo Kindle Unlimited). I'm very excited to use the memory to save all the books and audio-books.

- I have the Audible app on my phone, but the Kindle Paperwhite makes it more distraction-free. When you close the lid (or screen-saver mode), the audio still goes. But when you change to a different page, the audiobook stops (which means you have to stay on that page in order to listen to the book.) And you can start to listen even if the whole book hasn't fully downloaded yet. It also has all the necessary functions (like changing the reading speed, etc.)

- The Bluetooth works perfectly with the Bose headphones and easy to set up. You can also turn it off when not using it to save the battery.

- Another big plus feature and been anticipated for a long time is waterproof!! Love it!! Very practical and works really well.

I have been using it for the last few days, and the battery is still at full status. (reading and occasional audiobooks.)

I'm so happy that I upgraded my old Kindle Paperwhite to this All-New Upgraded version!!"
voracious reader,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this product to be able to access wifi audible since I don't read on my cellphone or laptop. I need to increase the font to read easily. After an hour working with their service department in the Philippines I still cannot try out the audible feature. They are going to call me back in an hour in the hopes that it completely down loads by then. It is bad enough that all their service personnel live overseas. Amazon earns so much money you would think that they would have a U.S. based service center. Besides the often heavy accents of the service people, they are not as knowledgeable as they should be, b/c none of them owns a personal kindle. They can only read on the one in the office there for all service personnel to use. I'll bet that these cost no more than $5 to manufacture. The service people in the offshore service centers do not earn enough to buy one at the retail price so they never become as proficient using it as they would be if they owned and used one for personnel pleasure. It is just awful that they neither pay enough to service people that they can afford their own kindle nor do they give them one for free to make sure they are fluent in its use. Give your overseas service people a free kindle or sell them one for the equivalent of $5. Then sell them their books at cost to you, Amazon. How about it.
Further, they have put a ""goodreads"" icon where the ""go to"" icon was. I don't want it now or ever. Goodreads is clearly an arm of Amazon so it never gives anything a bad review. I don't want it on there. When I tried to delete it, I was offered a choice of now or later. The choice of no or never is not there. I will have to spend another hour on the phone with Amazon service people in the Philippines to get rid of it. It is not to Amazon's advantage to teach the foreign service people how to get rid of the icon easily so they don't. It should be a one click removal function if it is there at all. If you do buy version of the kindle request that it come without the ""goodreads"" icon. I promise you you don't need it and you really do need the ""go to"" icon. Lauren"

Kerrie McLean,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm massively disappointed with this Kindle. I wanted to upgrade as I was running out of storage space and I was hoping for some extra features. This Kindle arbitrarily decides to do 15 minute update in the middle of reading a book. It frequently decides to go back a page or ahead 2 pages when you touch the right side to turn the page. I decided to just put up with these minor issues as I liked the extra space, the waterproof feature, and the Audible capabilities. ANd now, conveniently 2 weeks after the warranty expired, joy of joys, I now have the death screen shot and when I spoke with customer service they directed by to do a hard reboot by holding the power & volume buttons at the same time. Except that this Kindle doesn't have volume control. And yes, I did give customer service the model info. But hey, they can get me a discounted price on a new Kindle - YAY! So massively ticked off by this complete waste of money and Amazon's crap customer 'service'."
rider237,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle reader. I have been using the Fire tablets for years. I wanted something waterproof and this was priced right. What I didn't know is that you have to sync the book manually if you started it on another reader. Not a big deal but there are TWO sync places. One is for the entire reader at the top of the home page, but the one for the book is in the upper right 3 dot menu within the book.
I was frustrated not finding that. Was on the phone with Kindle help (very nice lady) and finally found the book sync.

SO, before you suffer the same frustration remember to sync the book, not the entire reader!

Other than that little glitch, I can read in the bathtub and not worry about dropping my tablet in the water. It's small enough to fit in my coat pocket for text to voice over bluetooth. It updates quickly and is (mostly) intuitive to use.

For the money, good deal!"
T,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am adding on to a previous review and moving down to 3 stars

as I said in the previous, the battery life is not great, it has gotten worse. I on average have to charge it every 2 days and I have not spent much time reading. I have a feeling I will have to replace this much earlier than I have had to with my other kindles.

There is something wrong with the connection cord and charger, you have to force the connection in to make it charge, which will also end up breaking earlier than expected.

If you have the choice go with one of the older models and save yourself some money.

My last paperwhite died a few weeks before this was released.

Pro- you can get to collections much easier, I do not have to scroll through 30 pages of books to get to the collections now. That is about the only pro over the other versions.

Cons-
- There are more adds, On the home screen that you use to scroll past to get to another book, there are so many Add's that it is hard to navigate sometimes.

- The on off switch is on the bottom in the middle and sticks out. If you set this on anything it will auto shut off while reading. Maybe they did this so we would be forced to buy a new cover?

- Page turning- sometimes it takes a tap, sometimes a swath, do not always know which, also amount of force needed is not consistent.

-Page turning again- on the older paper whites, top area on both sides were for going back, bottom on both sides for going forward. New Kindle, right side is forward, left is backward. This could be very ackward for some people (especially those with certain dissabilities). I would really like to see this returned.

- Battery life, as others have stated the battery life is much lower on this one. On average I am charging it once a week, this is down from 1x a month or less."
Infomapper,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What would I do without my Kindle? I use it all the time, and really enjoy the convenience of the built-in light and the touch screen. I also love the fact that I can quickly look up a word I don't yet know (especially for medieval historical fiction). I've been a voracious reader my entire life, and never thought I would go so smoothly from paper to an electronic book. One of the best things I've ever done."
Cylas,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The 2018 Kindle Paperwhite is great first e-reader for anyone who hasn’t owned an e-reader yet. I bought this (after just buying the 2017 Paperwhite generation a couple months prior) to be able to use the inverted night function and to have the more modern flushed screen design. The waterproof aspect wasn’t exactly the selling point for me (being most people don’t always read around water) but it is a nice touch. Wake up time and opening books are a tad slower than the 2017 Kindle Paperwhite generation but that’s trivial to the fact that a Paperwhite is still a very useful e-reader and would probably be the more logical pick over the basic Kindle E-reader and the Kindle Oasis. Also, this generation allows you to turn brightness off completely, whereas the previous generation didn’t fully dim when turning brightness to 0 (which is great to help save battery when in daytime lighting). Overall, you can’t go wrong with this product and it is highly recommendable."
Lisa Lane Friedman,1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered the new kindle paper white for my daughter for Christmas. She opened it this morning (Christmas day) and tried to use the cable it comes with to charge it and it doesn’t fit. I tried using my old kindle charger but that doesn’t fit either. Therefore she cannot use her present because we can’t charge it. I called amazon customer service to get a replacement and I have been on the phone on Christmas for the past 57 minutes trying to get a replacement!!!!! I have been switched around to 8 different people in the Philippines. I finally asked to speak to someone from America and the person they switched me to lied and said they were from America when they clearly were not. This is ridiculous. Amazon does not stand behind it’s own product!!!!
Scott M,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I love e-readers and this thing is unusable. Amazon what were you thinking? I would give it a -10,000 stars if i could. They put a button right where you hold the book. The button turns it on and off. Guess what. It turns on and off every minute. Design team was smoking too much pot when they made this one. Go ahead and get one. If you actually read books, you will return it in 24 hrs. Also turns on when in your backpack. This guarantees it will be dead when you want to use it. Literally worst design product i have ever purchased. Amazon wont let me return it. I will be calling customer service to demand a full refund. Unbelievable.

Update: got to the hotel and setup on beach to read all day. Nope. It was dead. It must have turned on in my backpack. This thing sucks. Totally useless."
Susan1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle. I like the Paperwhite the best of all the Kindles. This has the same features as my second Kindle, just more storage and longer battery life. The screen seems crisper and when highlighting it is faster and very smooth. I will not test it to see if it’s waterproof and hope I never have to assess that, but since I am in a humid climate, I suppose that will help protect it. It feels lighter and fits perfectly in its new case. I feel the Paperwhite has the best screen for eye health. Adjusting the light or size of font is heavenly. Having a little arthritis in my hands and reading A LOT, makes this an ideal investment. Paperback and hard cover books are harder to keep open to read than a Kindle! If this could just smell like a “real” book.........☺️"
Linda Townsend,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my old paperwhite to purchase the new one and the new paperwhite is much lighter, thinner and brighter than the old one. In those respects, its similar to my kindle voyage. However, the new paperwhite is slow to wake-up - even though I selected the options that supposedly made it faster to wake up - and the battery life is terrible. I can't even make it thru a book of around 300 pages w/o having to recharge it. My voyage holds a charge for weeks and through multiple books. My old paperwhite used to hold a charge for a long time. Whatever they did to the battery of this new one, wasn't an improvement. I also had trouble with the charging cable they included with it, but when I contacted Amazon, they replaced the charging cable w/o an issue. That's a good thing, as it's getting a lot of use since I have to charge it every few days. I'm only rating this new device 2 stars due to the battery issue."
nosnoma,1.0 out of 5 stars,"*Amazon gives you zero control of what appears on your device. Am I in a nursing home? Am I 5 years old? I think I can handle a little control over my device images.

I was so excited to finally get a kindle so I can have many books with me wherever I am.
This is awful. First, I didn't realize that if you choose ""includes special offers,"" it shows advertisements on your screen when you put it to sleep.
After calling in a couple times and paying $20 more to have the advertisements disabled, (they messed up the first time and didn't make the change) now I'm stuck with random bad black and white photo/""non""-artwork on my screen when it goes to sleep. I called in again and there is zero way to control what appears on your screen when you put it to sleep. (you cannot make it blank either) This is really disturbing and offensive that amazon won't allow the slightest level of control in the experience. It's such a personal device, and I would take it with me everywhere. I don't want to look at mediocre (or worse) stock photos pencils and paint brushes every time I look at my screen."
Scribe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I set up my ""All-New Kindle Paperwhite"" and ordered my first book. I was excited, because the book was one that could only be found as a Kindle version--the paper/hardcover no longer appears to exist. Unfortunately, it includes charts and photos, and I found there was no way to enlarge either. Even with a strong magnifying glass I could not read the print on the charts, and the photos were barely more than blobs. This made much of the book unusable for me.

I posted a 2-star review, and almost immediately I got a call from Amazon's Customer Service. Not to ask me not to post a 2-star review but, rather, to tell me there was a fix that I had not been able to find online, and could they help?

Apparently in earlier versions of the Paperwhite there was a setting in the ""accessibility"" area that addressed this issue, but you had to turn it on. With the NEW Paperwhite, it's a default feature! But because of this, I was not aware it existed (wasn't mentioned in the accessibility area, where I HAD looked, nor the tutorials--or if it were I missed it). TA DA! It works!!!

All you have to do is TRIPLE-TAP on a picture or chart (not double, but triple--who knew??) and it leaps out of the page as its own page. From there, you can even finger-stretch it! Voila! I can read all the little letters!!

I am now very satisfied and perfectly happy to give the New Paperwhite a 5-star review. And thanks again to Amazon for having such wonderful people to help us. I think I should have known there had to be a fix, because Amazon has never let me down yet, and I've been a loyal customer for many years. This was my Christmas present to myself, and now I feel like Santa just came down my chimney! (And a day early!) Cheers!!!"
Suzie C.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a 3rd generation Kindle/w special promotions for 5 years and love it. Thought it was time to upgrade to a newer generation. I really wanted to love this one too, but I really did not like it very much, due to the ads. The special promotions on the older Kindles were only on the opening page. Now they are everywhere. I could not tell the difference between my books and the books they are promoting. I could not even find my own books without seeing pages of books I don't own. On the second page, it said 'from your lists', but I have no lists and I don't own the books that were previewed. Very confusing.

The lighting also isn't great compared to the older model. It's either too bright or too dim. The screen is not any more sensitive than the old one (which I would have liked), it is not lighter and thinner, and if it is, you cannot tell the difference when holding one in each hand. I really thought it would be noticeably thinner and lighter. It is not. I haven't had it long enough to check battery life. My old one went for weeks and weeks, and I had read this generation battery goes longer.

I actually considering returning it, as I didn't know if I could deal with the disorganized mass of promotions all over the library pages. They seem to have deliberately set it up this way, so you accidentally buy books. I had a very difficult time distinguishing between the books I own and the books being promoted. Too much in your face. I actually liked the promotions on the other Kindle--I occasionally bought the one they promoted on the first page. Take note marketing--one focused book promotion is much more likely to entice you to buy, then pages and pages of book covers and titles.

So after I wrote this review, I contacted Amazon chat, and was able to fix the issue with the ads. I was amazed, but now am much happier with it. Also--thanks to Amazon tech support.

So the good news is that if the ads really drive you crazy enough to return it, there is a way that it can be corrected with the help of tech support, and also turning off Home Screen View."
Lyss Frizzle,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to like this kindle so much more than I was able to due to one simple fact: it's too bright. One of the main reasons I like Kindles is that I can read in the dark without overstimulating my eyes and keeping myself awake. The darkest backlight setting on this kindle is at least twice as bright as the darkest setting on my older paperwhite. I have no idea why the designers of this newer model felt the need to increase the baseline brightness so much, but it really ruins the device for me.

Otherwise the new kindle is sound. I've gotten it wet (though not submerged it) several times and it appears unphased. The battery life is a little worse than my older model but I suspect that has a lot to do with the elevated brightness.

If you're buying a Kindle specifically to read at night you may want to consider a different/older model.

The more I use this Kindle the more pissed I am that it's so bright. It's literally so bright it bothers my partner if I try to read it in bed while he's sleeping. And it hurts my eyes after not long. I almost wonder if I got a defective one because I don't understand why they would want to make it so bright even on the lowest adjustment. Would really like to know if others have this problem...."
Rippem,1.0 out of 5 stars,"First device had multiple issues. First, it was a bundle meant to include 6 months free subscription to the Kindle library. Problem was after purchase there was no way to claim it. In fairness to Amazon they did give me credit for it. Second issue the device and charging cable did not match. Third problem the screen would display at times like an etch-o-sketch that was being erased. If you are not familiar with the device not to worry just younger than me. Fourth issue, the device would freeze.

Amazon shipped a second device that had three main issues. First, the screen would often flicker when changing pages. Second, part of the screen had damaged pixels the size of a four characters when reading a page from a book. Third the device would freeze.

I was also surprised to find that the replacement device 's charging port accommodated the original power cable. To me this implies there is a problem with the manufacturing process of the devices rather than cable. In my opinion a very poor omen.

Customer Service did offer to send me a third device but given the multiple issues associated with both devices can only surmise now is not the time to purchase a Paperwhite. Also curious how I could not find the processor running the device, neither could anyone from Kindle technical support?

In fairness to Amazon as always they resolved any legitimate issues I had and refunded my money in full. The only difference this time is the process took much longer. Many of the overseas customer service representatives had a limited comprehension of the English language. Albeit they were very polite. Several mentioned they were from Asia but in truth I personally do not mind which country representatives are from so long as they can understand the English language.

In my day when selecting an outsourcing company or hiring a person for a customer facing position comprehension of the language spoken by my customer base was of paramount importance. Fine if they were trained to speak in an English accent and assigned names like Jack and Jill but if they can not fully comprehend what you are saying to them how can you expect them to resolve issues in a professional manner?"
Matthew C. Furze,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have been doing the bulk of my reading for the last few years on an old Kindle Fire (not even a Fire HD, it's that old). Hardly ever used the Fire for anything else (though it still works well), so decided to get the Paperwhite. Started looking at them in early October, saw that the new version was due out in early November. Worth the wait; I decided to splurge on the top-of-the-line leather case for it, so had to wait another week until it was available. Very pleased with the new Paperwhite. An occasional 2-page skip when advancing to the next page as others have noted, and now and then a quick flash of white on black when changing pages, but these are minor things. I like the weight of it (only 12 ounces with the case), and it really does seem to be easier on the eyes than the old Fire. Covers on books in the library are a bit hard to make out sometimes because the images are small and in black and white, but again, a minor thing. Highly recommended all in all."
JV,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had my previous Kindle Paperwhite for 5yrs and took up the offer to upgrade to the newest version in Dec. 2018. Other than some minor improvements to the backlight and resolution, nothing to rave about. The battery actually lasted longer in the older model, which is the most important benefit; and the touch screen is overly sensitive - I miss my older Paperwhite :( I guess I ’ll get my money’s worth on this one and trade up in a few years."
Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this new Paperwhite on the exchange plan. It was billed as the newest model with the latest upgrades. I can say that the evenness of the screen light has been improved noticeably. On the other hand the touch screen seems to be sluggish and even more so the wake up time when activating. My several year old unit was much better at both. Also, the battery life is touted as lasting weeks rather than days... I'm not sure how much you read, but I can suck down 10% or more of the battery at one sitting. I'm not believing I’ll be getting much more than a week out of a charge."
KathyC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"**UPDATE*** Amazon allowed my review to go through but shortly after I wrote this review I received a call from Kindle Customer Service. They had me try a solution that involved a hard reset and charging it again. It seems to have solved the problem of fast battery drainage. I do read a lot so I don't expect my battery to last as long as Amazon says it will, but I also know it was draining too fast for it to be normal. I love Amazon and Kindle CS! They know how to treat customers and I appreciate that they called me to try and fix my problem. Other companies (Sears lol) should take lessons from Amazon. I'm still a little disappointed at the slow wake up with the words ""Waking Up"" before you can swipe to unlock but the CS rep explained to me that it's due to the newer software and actually helps with battery life (when it works properly) and other new features. If you're one who has had trouble with the new 10th Gen Paperwhite battery life, I recommend calling Kindle CS (not just Amazon CS) and letting them know. I changed the star rating from 2 to 5 to reflect the change.

Although I didn't jump on the ereader bandwagon early, I've had Kindles since 2011. My first was the Kindle Keyboard (also called K3). We're a KIndle family. Between us we've had the aforementioned K3 the original Kindle Touch, the Basic, and several generations of the Paperwhite. Often we would buy refurbished Kindles and they were just as good as a brand new one. I didn't need a new Kindle as I was happy with my 7th generation Paperwhite. The only reason I bought this one was because of the bluetooth/Audible capability and I liked the idea of no raised bezel. I had been given a gift card and was waiting to use it on something I really wanted and this seemed like the time to upgrade to an exciting new version of the Paperwhite.

It's awful. As an ereader it's fine, but it takes longer to wake up (it even says ""waking up) than previous versions, and the battery life is just terrible. At first I left bluetooth on and it ran down very quickly but once I realized I left it on I turned it off. I haven't actually used it yet so other than that one time it's been off since I received the Kindle. I also never turn wifi on except when downloading a book, so wifi is not the issue. Airplane mode stays on. And still the battery life is terrible. This is Kindle #9 (not counting an early version of the Fire) in our household and the first one I've actually been disappointed with.

Don't waste your money. If you have a working Kindle stick with it. Maybe the next generation of this one will have fixed the bugs but this one is not at all worth it."
Joe Z,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wife got me this gift for my birthday. After using it for few weeks, I think I enjoy it better and better.

First, it doesn’t do much besides reading and “audible” books. But I think this is where it shines. I tried to read books on my iPhone and iPad before. It’s just hard to concentrate when you have notifications keep showing up. Also, after staring the LED and LCD screens for long enough, my eyes feel dry and tired easily. Kindle only gives you a nice E-ink screen. But it reads great under the light. Not to mention this version has backlight so it helps to adjust the light when you read in dim environment.

In addition, I really like the waterproof concept in this versions, as it leaves you less worries when you just put your kindle all around places like I do.

And the battery, is amazing. After the first charge when I got it. It last almost 2 weeks.

The only minor complain I have is the missing of physical buttons. But you can get around with it overtime.

Overall, if you like to read and don’t want to get interrupted, and feel good about your eyes, kindle is a great product for you."
Ken,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Update to my prior review. As described near location 810 of the Paperwhite user manual, I added some fonts from Office 2010 on my PC to the fonts folder in either one or both of the Paperwhites. This action may have caused the problems that I experienced. This is my second Paperwhite which replaced my first one that arrived only a few days ago that was defective and immediately returned. After setting up my second one it not only froze a few times but also displayed an inky front screen on one occasion. When I tried to open the 7th edition user guide that came with the device it froze again. After having enough troubles I tried to reset the device in order to remove personal information before returning it but it would not let me do it. I had to first do a restart then a reset. While the screen and light are wonderful, it's OS firmware seems to be a nightmare. Or maybe there are a bunch of defective units around with hardware problems? I have no idea. This behavior is definitely not characteristic of Amazon products!!!!! As a credit to Amazon technology, my 7 year old Keyboard Kindle still works great except for the screen recently having become darker, which is why I purchased the Paperwhite. Sadly I'm returning this Paperwhite also having been spoiled by the OS in my older Kindle, which just works without any flaws or headaches. I also have little patience for tech when it does not work well, like was sadly the case with both of my Paperwhites."
C. Swanson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd Kindle. With my older eyes it is nice to have the ability to adjust the font size. And where else can I have thousands of book right in my hand? I would have given it 5 stars except for the problems below.

But I have two major complaints. First, every one of my Kindles has had a bad power receptacle! They all eventually get loose and quit allowing the Kindle to charge. A Google search confirms this is a common problem. Why can’t Amazon fix this bad design? This is why I had to replace my first two Kindles, it’s just as cheap to replace as to repair. Second, Kindles have the worst so-called keyboard of any device I have ever owned. Again, why can’t it be improved?"
digitalbill,1.0 out of 5 stars,"AN UPDATE:

I like that it's lightweight, compact and readable in bright sunshine, but those are over shadowed by the things I don't like...

New First...
I put this review up on the site and someone from Amazon called me. I wasn't available so I'm not sure what theey wanted. I don't like calling customer service because you often get someone I can't understand what they are saying, so I sent TWO emails asking for answers about all the things I use unhappy with... and guess what no answer, nothing. So the review still stands.

Second...
Although you can read it in bright sunshine and at night, general normal reading is not so great. I used to read on my Fire 7 (which has a bright and crisp screen) and heard so much about the Paperwhite so I thought why not. However, unless you set it for the highest brightness level, it has a dull dimly lit screen. And at the highest level, it drains the battery. You might get a week or so but no where near a couple of months.

Third...
For some reason it turns it's self on with just touching the thing without touching the power button or swiping to unlock. And yes it does take a long time to wake up and unlock. And why do you need to unlock it? Swiping seems like a second unnecessary step. Just turn it on.

Fourth...
Often, the setting change and you have to reset the settings to get the clock to be on while reading and whether you want the page number or the time remaining for the book or chapter visible at the bottom of the page.

Fifth...
There is no real ""page turn"" or ""flip"" like you get with any other kindle enabled device. You tap the right side of the screen and it either goes black then to the next page or it simply changes.

Sixth...
Bookmarks are difficult to set. On the Fire7, just tap the top right corner and the page is bookmarked. Tap again and it's not. On the Paperwhite tap it once and a + or - shows up and tap the + sign to bookmark. Unless you have the page number at the bottom of the page (rather than the percentage left in the chapter or book, which I prefer) the bookmarks are identified by page number and difficult to determine which bookmark you want.

Seventh...
Yes, you do not need a color when you're reading, but... it would be nice if the book covers were in color so they are easier to read in your library.

Eighth...
I might be doing something wrong, but I'm not sure how to download a book directly to the thing. I need to download a book first to my ipad or Fire7 first. And if you want books from your library through Overdrive or Liby, since there are no apps on the Paperwhite, so I don't know how you do that."
Daniel S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I see that many, MANY people are complaining about the battery life of this Paperwhite, which I was also experiencing. I'd downloaded all my books and a few Audible files and the battery was draining at an alarming rate for a few days after.

I chatted into Amazon's support yesterday morning and one of the things they'd asked me is if I'd done a factory reset on it. Well, *obviously* I've been using Kindles since the keyboard models and *knew* that wouldn't help...but I went along anyway, just in case.

Huh. Insanely, it worked. It's a day later, and after getting all my books downloaded again, my battery is sitting at a comfortable 92% after a few hours of use that night and today at a fairly high brightness and sitting overnight. Without airplane mode being turned on.

We'll see if this stays as good or if it's a momentary tease and the device's battery will let me down.

Other than that, I'm loving this Paperwhite. I had the Gen 6 version previously, but the waterproofing (which I have not yet tested and really won't go out of my way to!) the Audible compatibility and extra storage (I got the 32 GB model) made this a no-brainer upgrade.

The only thing I don't like are the rather bleh newer cases. The previous leather cases felt very nice, and while I haven't yet picked up the leather version for this generation, the fabric case I got feels like a definite downgrade even considering the materials. However, that is NOT a knock against the device itself and I won't drop stars or anything for that decision. It'd be like calling an iPhone amazing except for the Apple-designed cases. Nothing to do with the phone itself.

All in all, I'm quite pleased. I'm hoping I won't have to exchange this Paperwhite for anything battery related, but if I do, I do. The Oasis doesn't really interest me, and the regular Kindle doesn't have the light, so the Paperwhite is my sweet spot. And if I need a bigger screen...well, that's what my iPad is for!"
Joshua S. Chap,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very conflicted with this product. I love how small and lightweight it is.

Having a backlight is a nice added feature that is not implemented all that well because in decent light it's really not needed, but if you forget to turn it down it will destroy your battery life and even then the battery life is not great and very misleading.

The interface is clunky and slow and honestly not all that user friendly at all. I highly recommend reading the documentation provided how to properly navigate when you register your Kindle reader because it's not clear or obvious at all. Once I did, found using this Kindle much easier to navigate but it's so slow that clunky that it can be frustrating to use this device.

I do love that it has Audible support but not being able to listen to them while reading is a weird backwards step. Not sure if this just was not well thought out or the OS is so underpowered it can't handle both at audiobooks and changing pages at the same time. Why have Audible support if you can't read along with the audiobook.

All that said it's a decent device with some baffling weird decisions that make it a hard choice to recommend at the price Amazon is asking. On sale I would consider it, but unless you need a backlight you may want to wait for a newer better version."
StarshineWF,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Thought highly of this model and shooed away naysayers who said the battery life stinks; that I should get a case for it to switch to automatic sleep mode when I close it

Well, unlike others I watch the brightest, online mode, don't use it for Audible, and I'm still hoping they add an update to allow reading of comic books cell x cell.

Tips: I'm happy with using a popsocket on it & plugging it to a powerbank that's usually w/me ** don't feel a screen protector **"
Patricia Masters,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm disappointed that this new one is not, in any important way, better than the generation 3, which works just fine. I'd like to return it, but when I checked the accepted reasons for returning for refund, none of them fit. What little has changed is not useful to me. I don't sit by the water or read in the bathtub (!?) so who cares about waterproof. I regret getting it. My fault for impulse buy. I bought it because I had my older one for nearly 3 years and was worried it might not last. Bad decision. Live and learn."
PSmith,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned 3 Kindles--the last two were Paperwhites so I could enjoy the device anytime and anywhere. Basically, I love everything Kindle: the size, the ease of accessing my favorite books, the way I can customize the reading format, and the list goes on. The first two lasted years, but my latest waterproof Paperwhite only lasted 5 months. That's way too much investment for so little return. At this point, I'm at a crossroads. I hate to forfeit my Kindle library, but I also hate wasting money on a reading device that quits working before I've had a chance to truly enjoy it."
M.E.B.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned my first new Kindle because the battery wasn’t lasting even 24 hrs. I received a replacement Kindle mid-May. All of a sudden, this weekend, I realized the battery wasn’t holding a charge. Within a couple of hrs after unplugging it from the charger and confirming a full charge, it reads 57%. I’m so disappointed. I’m thankful I still have my previous generation kindle to fall back on.
I’m giving up on this generation of kindle and hope the next one does better!

Addendum: 6/10/19. After contact from customer support yesterday, I reset the kindle to original factory settings. Since this a.m., the battery life is responding as it should. I’ll give it another few weeks to verify it doesn’t return to the battery dumping problem that resulted in my poor review."
Colleen Casey,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this device because it's like an upgraded waterproof Voyage without the buttons. The device is similar to that more than it is to the Kindle Oasis. I traded my Kindle Oasis 2017 in for this device because I wanted something simpler and lighter... and Paperwhites are also known for better battery life usually.

I never liked the older Paperwhites. For whatever reason, they were too shadowy for me. But this one doesn't have ANY shadows at all and I like how smoother the screen is.

I can't judge the battery yet because I spent most of the weekend trying to get my device to be on the 5.10.1.2 version or whatever the latest version is supposed to be, and all of the refreshing, resetting, and all that ate a lot of battery life. But I am going to pay attention to it this week. My only solution to the update is just to be patient about getting it. I can't wait to be able to see the percentage though!

I do wish this had night time mode, but it's not a complete loss since I have a Kobo for that feature. I LOVE the fact that Kindle Unlimited is free for six months with this. I had been wanting to get into that again.

I like how lighter this Paperwhite is compared to the other ones. That was an improvement too.

Overall, this device is a four out of five stars. I'd recommend this to anybody who was looking at the Oasis but was saying that was too much for them. I feel like this is the best out of the Voyage, Paperwhite and Oasis world."
Tam,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love to read and paper books will always be my first love, but my kindle is my constant companion. I'm one of those readers with multiple books started at any one time. I may be in the mood for a light and easy beach read or a good mystery/thriller. Other times it may be a book about astronomy and our reach for the planets. Sometimes it's a biography or a look at the history of a region. If I have my kindle handy all of my books are right there, and if I decide that I'm not in the mood for a book I've already started there are many more to choose from already downloaded or easily obtained.

The dictionary feature is wonderful. I just touch the a word that I am unsure of and the definition pops up then I immediately get back to reading. No more guessing.

Jumping from book to book I sometimes need a reminder about the identity of characters or the significance of a location. I just search a name or word and the kindle shows me each instance the word/character appears in the book and I'm reminded how it fits into the story. I can also search the kindle store for a subject that I would like to read more about. If a place name or subject comes up in my book I touch the word and can search for additional books in the store that cover that subject.

The font can be changed very easily as well as the size of the letters. I lent it to my 91 year old Mother-In-Law and she had no problem adjusting it and didn't have to strain to read.

I'm sure that there are other things that can be done with the kindle that I haven't discovered yet but these are the tools that I use the most.

This paperwhite is waterproof and perfect for floating in the pool and reading. The screen is easy to read in the bright sun and and has a lit screen for reading in the dark areas. I generally like to have a dark screen with white writing when reading in dark areas and this can be done by going to ""All Settings"" then ""Accessibility"" then ""Invert Black and White"". It is lightweight and easy to hold and is especially convenient when traveling.

I haven't dropped my kindle in the water yet but it has been splashed and survived without any issues.

I love this kindle and recommend it whole-heartedly."
William A. Watson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First, a little background. I dismissed e readers a while ago. I had an iPad (over the years, several different models of them) and Kindle Fire tablets. I love to read, but I’m not a “rabid, voracious” reader like a lot of Kindle fans are, so I didn’t think spending the money on one years ago was worth it. This is my second model Kindle e reader, the first being the 3rd generation Paperwhite, so I only have that to compare it too. Personally, I’m in love with this new, 4th generation model, and it’s well worth upgrading too. But, I gave it 4 stars overall and I’ll explain why.

I guess I’m getting older, but reading on a color tablet was getting hard at night. Even when Apple introduced Night Shift (a software update that made the screen “warmer” by cutting down on blue light the screen emits), which gave the overall appearance a yellowish, orangish tinge to the screen that helped, but I was still suffering from eye strain.

Low and behold, the 3rd generation Paperwhite went on sale (they frequently do) from the then price of $119 to $99. I had flirted with getting a now discontinued Voyage or possibly the first generation Oasis, but since I still wasn’t sold on a e reader yet, I went with the Paperwhite. What was I thinking all of these years! If you love to read books, this is the format to do it in!

I was hooked. No more eye strain at night. Could read just fine during the day, even in sunlight. Overall very happy with the device. The 3rd generation had the same screen resolution as the higher end models, but everything was manual, like adjusting the screen brightness, and there were no buttons for page turns, features the higher end models did have. But overall, and especially for the price, I was very happy. That was 2 years ago.

Fast forward to today (as of this writing) and the 4th generation Paperwhite has been out for about 6 months now. Base price went up to $129, a $10 hike from the previous model, but it included double the storage, it was waterproof, and it had a flush screen with the edges (more on that in a minute). Plus other features like support for audio books, but that’s something I didn’t need. But my 3rd generation was still working fine, so I passed for a while, until I received a notification that I could trade my old Kindle in towards a partial credit on a new one. SOLD!

I received a printable return label and shipped my 3rd generation back. Once received and processed, I received a email that my credit was all set, so I placed my order for the new 4th generation. In the meantime, I read countless reviews here on Amazon about the new model and I watched several YouTube videos, specifically ones that compared and contrasted the new with the prior model. When I received it, I couldn’t have been more happy. But let me address some of the complaints others had first.

Out of some of the complaints and low ratings/reviews here on Amazon, most are not warranted in my opinion. One of the big complaints is that the power button at the bottom of the device protrudes far and it is easily pushed, thereby putting the device in sleep mode. Well, like I previously mentioned, my only other Kindle e reader was the prior generation and this model, the power button is much CLOSER than the 3rd generation, and it wasn’t a problem on that device at all. In fact, with this new model, not only is the button more flush with the Kindle, but where it is located is also where the micro USB port is for charging. The 3rd generation had a slight “bump” on the rear of the Kindle, I suppose to accommodate the port, but with the new Paperwhite, everything is flush with the device. Very smooth. And no, since I didn’t have a problem with the old device by accidentally hitting the power button, I certainly don’t with this one.

Another complaint I kept reading was how long the 4th generation took to wake up. From what I read, the internals haven’t changed between the 3rd and 4th generation models and quite frankly, I didn’t see any difference at all in starting the device, page turns, updates, downloads, anything at all. So, not sure why people were complaining about that. If this is going to be your first e reader, well, it’s NOT like an actual tablet. Don’t expect instantaneous page turns or anything. This also has to do with the type of screen, e ink. It’s not like an LCD screen. But it’s not supposed to be either. It’s meant for reading books and for what it is focused on, it does it near perfectly.

Once I received mine, I can tell you that there is a difference in size and weight, albeit small, but for me, it was noticeable. And for the better. I don’t mind the bezels at all (another complaint people kept bringing up) as it makes holding it easier while reading. But the BIGGEST thrill for me was the FLUSH SCREEN. For those that don’t know what I’m referring too, the 3rd generation’s screen sat back from the bezels about 1mm lower. I know that doesn’t sound like much, but believe me, the screen looked “depressed” in the Kindle and for the life of me, little hairs (mainly from my animals) would get stuck between the bezel and the screen and it drove me nuts sometimes trying to pull them out so I could read. Ahhh...the new Kindle Paperwhite’s screen is a dream come true. Sure, the Voyage and Oasis folks already had that upgrade, but for me, it was the entire selling point for the new Paperwhite and it doesn’t disappoint. I honestly love it.

Yes, being waterproof is a nice feature. Although I won’t be reading this in a bathtub or next to a pool probably, I do go backpacking in the woods and not having to worry if a rain storm will ruin it is nice. More storage, for me, not really needed, but also nice to have I guess. Don’t need to be as reliant on wi-fi to download things. Can take a large library with me and have no worries. And for some, the ability to pair some Bluetooth headphones and listen to audio books will be a big selling point. For me, no, but I can see people requesting that feature.

Overall, if you have an older Paperwhite, or for that matter, and older Kindle, and you’re looking to upgrade, this is WELL WORTH IT! Very pleased and I’m sure I will be for years to come if it’s like anything I experienced from the prior model. Contrary to a lot of other reviews on here, it is a fairly big upgrade for the flush screen in and of itself. If you have the extra cash, you could look at the Oasis, but I held one in a store and I didn’t like it. I like the flat back of the Paperwhite. It’s much easier to hold and read with in my opinion. If the Voyage was still available, I would have considered that, but sadly it was discontinued (and I kicked myself for not just coughing up the extra money 2 years ago for it).

Now, the 2 reasons why I ultimately gave it 4 stars overall:

1) The screen color and brightness. I knew this before purchasing it from prior reviews and well as watching side by side comparison videos. First, the screen is not as “crisp white” at the same brightness level. I wish I still had my old one (remember, I shipped it back first before I received the new one) to do my own comparison, but there is a difference. Even though the 4th generation has 5 LED lights compared with 4 for the older model, the screen needs to be several notches higher to achieve a similar level of brightness, and it’s still a bit on the “orange tinge” side. I really preferred the “crisp whiteness” of the older model, but it’s not a huge difference if you turn it a little brighter. For example, I had it on a level 15 with some background light on with the old model and I need to be around a level 18 to 20 on the new model for a similar brightness. Downside is lower battery life by having the brightness up. And again, it’s just not as white.

2) The touchscreen doesn’t seem as responsive as the prior model. As stated, the internals are the same, same processor, same RAM, as the 3rd generation, but sometimes, when I select say a book, or want to go to settings, I may have to hit it twice. Never had that issue with the older model. This doesn’t happen all of the time mind you, but it does happen. Not sure if it’s the new screen or not, even though I love it, but it’s an issue that I felt needed to be pointed out.

If I had the option, I would have given this 4.5 stars, but I didn’t and I couldn’t give it 5, so 4 stars it is. But I’m overall thrilled with it and I think, especially for the price, most others will be too, especially if you’re coming from an older Kindle."
serenechaosnyc,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I tend to have my paperwhite follow me around (i had the prior version). That means when I'm washing dishes, it's on its stand getting wet, for instance. So, when I found out that this version was waterproof, I traded in my paperwhite and bought this one. My impression is that functionality wise, it's pretty much the same. I do like how it feels but now that I have a case on it, it doesn't really matter how the machine itself feels :o) I don't expect too much more in terms of functionality because I liked how my old paperwhite worked. So, basically, if you have an old paperwhite and you don't care about the waterproofing (and audible), this version is unnecessary. Speaking of audible, it works fine with a bluetooth headphone. I don't really like audio books but this did get me to try one and it sounds good, audio wise. (the narrator, on the other hand...).

I have a few gripes though- one, there is glare in certain situations. It reflects the light. I just have to move it away from the light source and all good. It's definitely not as bad as my phone but it isn't totally glare free.

The internal light seems weaker- it may just be me but I keep my light around level 12 and i feel like this level 12 ends up being a bit darker than with my prior paperwhite.

And my biggest gripe is that the screen get fingerprints and smudges really easily and quickly. I end up carrying around a microfiber cleaning cloth because it annoys me so much.

Overall, I'm happy that I upgraded, all because of the waterproof aspect. But if you have the old version, don't expect it to be a huge upgrade in functionality.

Update: I had to send it back for repairs because seriously, the battery life is horrifying. It lasts a day. i have a 1st generation paperwhite and it lasts weeks as promised. This one lasts a day if i'm lucky doing if wifi is on and only about 3-4 days if wifi is not on."
Stassi Parris,1.0 out of 5 stars,"With Audible being added, I assumed it would have allowed me to read and listen to the audio version at the same time. No immersion reading. I have my fire tablet for that, but would have loved the paperwhite to have the same feature. For that, I would have to return it and upgrade when they have decided to add this feature. Hopefully, Amazon will release the next generation paperwhite in white. I really wanted to love this paperwhite."
Amazon 4 Life,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave this newer model 4 stars, because as mentioned by others, the power “button” protrudes too far out, resulting in the unit restarting. The prompt to cancel the restart, or power down is very fast, so even when I’ve selected cancel, it’s too late and the Kindle powers down and restarts!! This occurs, even with a cover. Stand the Kindle up and boom, there it goes, shutting down. Some have suggested Landscape mode to avoid this, a solution, true; BUT as the customer I shouldn’t have to consider this inconvenience!! It’s not the typical way we hold a “book”. VERY ANNOYING. Love that it’s water resistant! I read worry free while I bathe or at the pool. The only other difference with the previous white paper model is Bluetooth, and how the setting selections have been offered. Still getting used to those changes. The previous model design for settings worked well, honestly this new model seems awkwardly designed. I purchased a new White Paper Kindle because the battery on my previous unit was starting to drain quickly. I gave that unit to my husband since he doesn’t read as often as I do. If not for the battery, I would not have purchased a new Kindle White."
Scott,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Mine has never worked as advertised. The battery doesn't last for weeks.... a few days yes weeks no. My phone, my iPad, my tablet computer is far superior to this. I got it because of the weeks of battery.... The page turning is terrible, I have to pound the screen hard to get the page to turn and often it turns multiple pages at a time.

I expected this to be a great product for reading Kindle books but it is not. It offers less features than using a Kindle app.

Right now my Kindle keeps restarting on its own every few minutes.

I can not recommend this Kindle E reader."
K. Wishowski,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this as an upgrade to my basic Kindle that I bought in 2012.

I really like that it is noticeably lighter and thinner than my basic Kindle. The screen being flush with the border looks and feels better than I anticipated.

On my basic Kindle, there is a pretty noticeable lag between touching the screen and the operating system registering the touch and carrying out the process. For example, tapping the screen to go to the next page takes a full second and the screen flashes blank during the transition. That seems piddly, but it makes a surprisingly huge difference that this Kindle doesn't have that issue. The entire interface and touch screen just seems much more responsive and that's great.

It is pretty disappointing that there is no usb-c charging port, just a regular micro-usb port, but I have not yet any of the issues with battery life that I'm reading about in other reviews. However, unless I'm shopping for and downloading a book, I keep the device on airplane mode. The dictionary works fine without the internet, you only really need that for wiki articles and Goodreads sttuff which I'm fine without. It's quick and easy enough to turn it back on should I need it. I can use the device for several hours on airplane mode though and barely notice a dent in the battery life.

All up, I'm very happy with it and I'm glad I upgraded.

With that said, I think the next generation of Kindles would be utterly amazing if they reduced the size of the screen border and equivalently increased the screen size, as well as added a usb-c charger. Just my 2c."
seasider,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After losing my Kindle Paperwhite somewhere in LAX, I ordered the new generation Kindle Paperwhite. Here is my assessment:
The Good: smaller, lighter, no bezel to collect dust, somewhat waterproof
Not-so-Good: Battery life is much less (days instead of weeks), lighting not as bright and type contrast lower, slow to wake, swipe required to open, frequent unexpected shut-offs due to power button location

My old Kindle was eventually returned to me, but I am still using the new Kindle mostly because of it's smaller size. I am learning to avoid the power button and am charging more frequently. I wouldn't get one for my vision-impaired husband because of the light and contrast issues. I also would not upgrade if I did not need a new Kindle. Hopefully Amazon will update the software to fix some of these issues in the future."
Karen Jones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Hints for making a waterproof Kindle Paperwhite less irritating to use

New Homepage: Amazon has added a new homepage. The page with the list of your collections/ebooks is now “your library.” The new homepage is not totally in-your-face marketing, but about two-thirds of it is.

The three book covers in the upper left corner are the three ebooks you have opened most recently. Just click on the cover to open the ebook.

“Your reading lists” are books (ebooks and print) you put on some type of list at Amazon. You can remove the books, but I spent way too much time deleting books I looked at 15 years ago or longer.

The row at the bottom is the start of rows of books Amazon’s analytics has selected for marketing to you, etc.

I always pay extra to get a Kindle without special offers so I don’t know what the special offers page looks like.

Navigating Your Library: To move from page to page in your list of collections or your list of books in your library/in a collection, I recommend swiping your finger up to go to the next page and down to go to the previous page. If you swipe your finger to the left or right (like you do within an ebook and like I used to do within a collection), the Kindle may slow you down while you wait for it to download ebooks from the cloud. I spent too much time on the telephone with a customer-service executive to learn this. He didn’t understand what I meant when I said I needed to go from page to page within a collection.

The ebooks which are not in a collection are not listed after your collections. Ignore that statement in the user’s guide. (I don’t have a clue which one of the Paperwhite user guides is the correct one for the waterproof Kindle Paperwhite. The only one I can get to using my waterproof Kindle is the 4th edition, and I have editions 2 through 12 on my other Kindle Paperwhite.)

Slowness and Variable Sensitivity: I don’t know what to do about the device’s slowness in waking up or its extreme variability in sensitivity to touch. I can understand when it doesn't respond to my touch but not when it responds multiple times to one touch.

Cover: I recommend not getting the “All-new Kindle Paperwhite Water-Safe Fabric Cover (10th Generation-2018).” It makes it awkward to open and close the Kindle and easy to accidentally touch the on/off button. According to some other customers, the fabric frays. (Wish I had read that before I purchased mine.)

Wondering why I kept the waterproof Kindle Paperwhite? My Kindle Paperwhite has “issues”—enough for SquareTrade to replace it, but it’s out of stock. Since I wanted a Kindle with the range of 14 sizes of font—rather than 6 which seem to double in size—buying a waterproof Kindle was my only choice."
toryja,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this one because I live in Amsterdam and it rains. A lot. After wanting to take my Kindle last week on my bike and another day on the bus but didn't because it was raining so much, thought why not invest in one that it didn't matter if a little rain came in contact with it.

Compared to the last Paperwhite, Gen 3, it's not a huge difference. Side by side with settings at the same levels, the backlight seems a little better and more evenly distributed on the new Gen 4.

The completely flat front of the Gen 4 is nice and annoying. It's easy to switch pages, touch the items on the edge like page/location/etc., and just has a nice feel to it. However, the Gen 3 raised edges do make it easier to not turn the page if your fingers slip a little too close to the edge. The Gen 4 does seem to pick up finger prints a little easier. The ""glare"" is the same as the Gen 3. It's not huge, but noticeable. The texture of the screen is different. The Gen 3 feels more like paper compared to the new one. The Gen 4 screen is more smooth, like a typical tech device.

They say this is the slimmest and lightest Paperwhite, not by much. It's just small enough you'll need a new case and honestly who can tell the difference between a few grams.

The Gen 4 does respond to touch input faster than previous versions. Makes it easier to leave a review about a book, post to Good Reads, Twitter or Facebook, and make notes.

Can't comment about the battery yet as it's just come in. But after reading for a couple hours today, it's gone from 100% to 96% with backlight at 10, wifi on, and bluetooth off.

For me it was worth the money at the reduced price (and I would have sent my Gen 2 in for the extra trade in value if it wasn't on another continent) to upgrade only for the waterproof feature and it'll be nice to have an extra Kindle laying around or to leave back in the US when visiting. If you're happy with your Gen 3 and don't need the waterproof or Audible feature, it may not be worth the upgrade. Unless you really need the storage or just love the latest gadgets.

For me here's the Pros:
- better back light
- waterproof
- flat front
- option for bluetooth if I sign back up for Audible

Cons:
- flat front makes it a little too easy to change pages
- needed a new case
- battery will drain faster if bluetooth is left on (but easy to disable if not in use)
- I had to spend more money
- I have another Kindle laying around the house

Leaving a review on the Amazon US site, purchased on Amazon German site. Because it wouldn't ship from the US site and the German site won't allow English reviews. Insert facepalm."
The Den,2.0 out of 5 stars,"In general I love the kindle devices. However, I specifically upgraded this from my previous kindle paperwhite device because it is waterproof. So that's nice. Here's what is bad:
1) When turning on, this thing goes super bright before adjusting to the previously set brightness. My ""old"" one didn't do this, and it is TERRIBLE when turning on in a dark room (e.g., in bed).
2) The ""od"" paperwhite had a slightly grippy texture that made it easy to hold and allowed me to prop it up on it's side at nigth leaning against a pillow. This is too slick, so it slides down and is harder to hold. I hate that I'm considering spray painting it with a grippy paint to regain this feature. Why the step backwards Amazon?
3) MOST IMPORTANT: My old kindle would go REALLY dark while still being illuminated, perfect for night time reading. It also felt slightly yellow, which is also good for sleepy time. The new one? The dimmest setting is so bright in a dark room that it's certainly destroying your melatonin production. There's no way to get it truly dim, and the light quality is much more blue, which again is bad. I'm upset that I bought this, and am now back using the old one. Guess this will be my ""pool and beach"" kindle.

Not happy."
Everett's Dad,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited far too long to buy myself a Kindle. I’ve use the app on my phone, on my iPad mini, on my fire tablet, so I didn’t really think I needed one. It’s so light weight and so easy to hold, it’s so comfortable. I have and use a lot of gadgets. I didn’t think I needed a dedicated E reader. But it’s so good! The field is really unlike any other tool I’ve used to read. I still have books that I will always need physical copies of, but for the other 99 gagillion books in the world, this is perfect!"
Ty L,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like reading on this. The resolution is good enough that I can read natively pdf's just fine for the most part or use pinch techniques to expand.

The send to Kindle option you can install on your pc is really useful to get your .mobi and pdf to the Kindle. Using the filter you just look for ""docs"" and finally read those humble bundle pdf's that have been sitting on your pc for years. If you have epub's that are DRM free you just change the extension from .epub to .png and your Kindle will automatically convert it to readable.

I back a lot of kickstarters and this is a nice feature as reading on my phone is annoying. I'm quite satisfied so far. Wish I'd purchased one years ago rather than a tablet. Reading really makes a difference that I hadn't grokked back then. Oh, and if you read pdf's just keep in mind it is really only good for sequential reading of the pages and not very good for zipping around if you're reading an RPG game book."
nob,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The lighting distribution is better than the previous model. I had to return a device when I bought the previous model because the light was dimmer towards the bottom of the page. This time around, the page seems more evenly lit.

There isn't a lot of difference in the reading experience between this and the previous model that I can feel. There are memory upgrades and all that--I'll leave that to the specs. But as a reader going through a book, not a whole lot of perceptible difference. However, the device aesthetics has improved:

* The screen is no longer recessed from the frame to trap lint and dust.
* The back now has a subtly soft rubber feel riminiscent of the Nook Simple Touch. I hope it ages well, but it's too early to tell. Unfortunately, it's still flat, and together with the small profile and the sensitive touch screen, it's still a bit tricky to hold for a long time. There is a mode, I learned recently, to turn off the tap-to-turn-page feature (swiping still works) that should help.

Whines:
* Amazon has invested too much in its proprietary format to support ePub. That's a shame. It forces me to constantly own a Nook and a Kindle. If they support ePub I would consider dropping the Nook, except...
* Night light! The latest Nook has an amber light option to night reading. While that device has its problems, the idea of having a night-friendly lighting is not new; all the laptops and phones have it (or apps to do it). I hope the next ""generation"" will have it."
Shaza,4.0 out of 5 stars,"seems I got a good unit. works almost perfect and after taking a long break from reading I am now reading daily and enjoying it on the kindle. this being my first kindle, I am very impressed. reading on the kindle is a pleasure, I don't use the backlight during the day and during the night the lights serves me just fine. read a bit of negative reviews that put me on edge but the price drop to 89 USD made me pull the trigger. the power button doesn't bother me much and neither do the adverts or slow start up but then again this is my first ereader. just hope it lasts
pros:
perfect size
perfect screen
decent battery life
very good price when I got it
cons:
fingerprints but they only affect the bezel and back so I can read just fine
the page jumps, they can happen anytime. you are reading a page and next thing you know you are a few pages ahead
only good for books but thats fine. pdfs and other docs just don't look as good and might need a tablet for that but I bought this for books

I wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars since I am really enjoying the fact that I am back to reading books but that option is not available. it's a good ereader, would definitely recommend it for a first time buyer and frequent readers"
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have pretty big hands and with the cover folded back I like to hold my kindle with a finger between the cover and the kindle so I have a better grip. You can't do that left handed. If you reverse the cover (so it opens to the right) you can do it but you lose the automatic power off/ startup.
Also, you can't switch page turning areas on the screen so it feels much less natural holding in your left hand. Clearly it is designed for right handed people and if I was right handed it would be a really nice device. But I'm not. Lack of equal accessibility = poor engineering. Bad on Amazon... If you are left handed you may want to look at other options. Sad... Edit- I got a nice surprise call from customer support. We had a good discussion about usage and handedness. There is no current solution to the poor engineering (my words not theirs) but at least the person understands the issue. In short- technology should adapt to people. People shouldn't have to adapt to the technology. Technology (or non-tech products) should be able to accommodate something as common as being left handed. Can you use it left handed? Yes but uncomfortably. Does it feel as natural as holding it in your right hand? No, or at least no, not the way I hold it.
Edit edit- Thanks Amazon for putting this on sale a couple of weeks after black Friday and cyber Monday when most items are discounted. Those of us who paid full price during that time feel pretty ripped off."
Andrew S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first e-ink kindle. I was really hesitant to move on from actual books. But now that I have it, I absolutely love it!! Now I can read in bed when I wake up early and don't want to turn on a light which will disturb my husband. I often use the light on the lowest setting, and the battery lasts for hours. With one charge, I was able to get through about 4 decent-length novels, with using the light at least 50 percent of the time.

The touch screen took a bit of getting used to, since it isn't highly responsive. Also, when it is dark, it is hard to turn on the light when you can't see the screen. But if the light used during the previous usage, it will automatically turn back on.

My only dislike is with e-inks in general, because after reading a book, I like to see what I've read to make recommendations for others. This was solved by having a spread sheet where I track the books and give them my own rating."
Gem,1.0 out of 5 stars,"1. I do not like opening the cover and seeing this ""Waking Up"" my 7 Gen did not do that
2. I have closed the cover for a short period of time, when I open cover, I got the 'static' screen and it did not open, pressed the power button and it still did not open. THIS HAPPENED 4 TIMES! Had to restart kindle.
3. I did a a hard RESET, pressing the power button for 40 seconds and STILL have had the SAME PROBLEMS
4. I set kindle to show PAGE and it has RESET ITSELF TO TIME LEFT IN BOOK or CHAPTER OR NOTHING and this has happened while I was reading!!
5. I closed the cover for less than 5 minutes, opened cover to read and KINDLE DID NOT OPEN, had to press power button.
I take vacations on cruise ship's and I do NOT want to have these problems while on the ship because, while we are sailing, we do NOT have WIFI connection SO I could not do a HARD RESET.
I will return Kindle, cover and extended warranty."
BLand,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far the batter life is amazing. I've had it for about two weeks. I would consider myself a night reader about 2 hours a night, and I haven't had to charge it yet. This battery is amazing! It's nicean light, but maybe a little awkward after a while to hold for extended periods of time. So I bought a strap so it's more comfortable to hold for long periods of time. If there is one big down fall it would be the touch screen and it's response time. Now it could just be me, being an impatient person, but when I click on something I want an immediate response. So it does lag a little bit when clicking links, but on the plus side, I haven't noticed a lag when turning pages."
Chad Hall,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been reading my Kindle books on my iPad for years but it’s fairly heavy for laying in bed reading and it hurts my eyes after a while, so I decided to try my first Kindle.

Let me said first that the reading experience is wonderful in comparison. This feels very close to paper and is lighter than most books. But after years of having the snappy response of the iPad the Kindle feels archaic. Most clicks take 2-3 seconds to even register. But honestly I’m not a nit-picker and if I’m sitting down to read, I’m not in a rush, so I guess I can adjust to going back 15 years in device speed.

The one thing I find annoying is that the Kindle (Amazon’s flagship device) has less features than the app Amazon makes for Apple. On the iPad you can listen to an audio companion and have the app highlight and flip the pages in sync. Not on the Kindle. You have two choices. Listen or read."
Dr. Hoenikker,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you already have a paperwhite or a voyager and consider upgrading. The only question to ask yourself is: Do you keep dropping your kindle in water? If the answer is no, there is no reason to upgrade whatsoever.

If you're buying your first kindle and choosing between this and oasis, get the paperwhite. Oasis is slicker and has a nicer bigger screen. But its weird square shape makes it hard to fit into most pockets, and for most budgets it makes no sense to pay twice the price for slightly nicer screen.

Finally, if you are considering adding on any upgrades to the basic paperwhite: an average book is about 2M, so 8G should be enough for pretty much anyone. Cellular connectivity COULD be nice, but Amazon doesn't offer that on it's own, you'd have to get ALL upgrades, doubling the price. So get the basic 8GB version, it's a pretty nice reader for the price"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought this to replace an aging Nook. I had some issues with the Nook not being able to work with Overdrive from my library, so it was time to retire it.

You might notice that some reviewers say ""the advertisements are not bad"".

The advertisements show up on the front of your Kindle when it is in idle mode... or off, or sleep, or whatever you want to call it. I'd like to point out that these are not advertisements for authors Clive, Cussler, Sandford, King, Follett etc. Instead, expect an illustration for freakish circus clowns, or my favorite... a Japanese Anime school girl in somewhat undersized clothing. Maybe ok if you are a 14 year old girl, but if you are a 57 year old dude with grey hair you get interesting looks on the plane.

I can't help but wonder if this is somewhat done on purpose, and how many of us buy the ""advertisement free"" upgrade shortly after purchasing the Kindle and having it pop up advertising for material that doesn't match our reading genre at all. It is so badly out of sync with what I read, that it seems contrived.

My other complaint is that this e-reader does not have a means to directly connect to overdrive. If you use overdrive, you have to log into overdrive, navigate to your local library, and select and download your books to Amazon first. WTH? This likewise has to be by design. They purposefully make it more difficult to borrow books than to purchase them.

On the plus side... my Kindle does not have any noticeable missing pixels or bright spots. It seems to be functioning well. I've only had it for a little more than a week. Short of the annoying advertising, I think it will serve me well."
Rose Girl,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m so disappointed in this Paperwhite. I purchased it because I was excited about the splash-proofing.
HOWEVER, the battery life is abysmal! I don’t know if I have a lemon, but for goodness sake, I expect better. I’m lucky to get three days on a charge. I only get to read for maybe 2-3 hours at a time. That’s with the backlight turned down to 1 or 2 and making sure I turn the screen off when I’m done reading. The button on the bottom doesn’t bother me, as I have a case on the Kindle. I can’t imagine how quickly the battery will drain if I use it with Audible."
James Clarkson,1.0 out of 5 stars,The product description on this page for this particular model states that it has cellular connectivity which was not the case with the one that was sent to me. I do not have wireless internet at my home and was therefore unable to connect the device to anything. My older Kindle which I am still using has 3g connectivity which is great. Not sure if they sent me the wrong one or what the problem was but I am very disappointed with this product and will be sending it back. Also it is advertised as having 8GB of memory yet when I turned it on it stated that it only had 6gb of available memory.
Jon H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had 4 Kindles since 2010 with the 3rd gen Kindle Keyboard. As far as improvements over the old PW, I don't see much difference, and wouldn't have bought it myself. As a gift though, awesome!

My wife gave me the new WP Paperwhite for Christmas. I promptly lost it New Years Eve. We thought it fell out of our car and was gone. This morning (1/3) I found it beside my Jeep. It had been outside, in the snow and rain since that night. I brushed the snow off, took it inside to dry and it works like new. No problems at all. Even with the cold (I live in Vermont), the battery was fine and it started right up. Pretty amazing.

I repair electronics for a living and really didn't expect that it had a chance of surviving. I'm a believer. It is definitely more rugged than previous versions. Put a good case on it to protect from drops and you've got a device that will last."
Natasha,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle paperwhite. It's beautiful and functional. The built in light is amazing for reading outdoors and it's very user friendly. The battery lasts forever and the touch screen is responsive. The small size is perfect for even my smallest purse and it weighs practically nothing. I no longer have to worry about messing up a book while throwing it in my bag. Plus, I can switch books depending on my mood or progress level without having to carry two or three books like before. I am thoroughly in love.

Some Cons:

The screen emits blue light with no option of yellow light. I love reading before bed and with the lights dimmed, the blue light is very strong. It would be great if for the next gen, we could have both blue and yellow light.

Organization. I wish you could filter the books by genre. I have thousands of books and it gets really hard to sort through all of them. It would be great if Amazon set up a better system for sorting through ""All"" and ""Downloaded"" books.

Overall, though there are some cons, I love my kindle and I don't regret buying it."
ShariB,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I started with a Kindle 2nd generation and a basic kindle 5th generation and I am very pleased with the new PaperWhite. I like the larger storage. I was concerned about losing my page turn buttons but quickly adapted to the touch screen (I read with kindle in my left hand and wanted to stay using only one hand to read). I also have a few books with audible and like that I can switch easily from read to listen to read and only need my headphones. The ability to set ""themes"" allows me to quickly adjust from books that come with different font sizes built in. I found the PaperWhite to be a very nice kindle and am happy with it. (I gave the basic kindle to my husband who doesn't read as much as I do - he likes it and really likes built in dictionaries)."
mangodrink,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My 2018 8gb arrived, and I compared it to my 2013 Paperwhite. The front panel material seems similar to past Kindles, seems like plastic, not glass; it doesn't bend/flex to regular pressing though. It is matted and anti-glare, but with a smoother finger glide comparable to coffee table book good paper vs. the 2013's rougher texture closer to mass paperback. It does pick up fingerprints and oils, but about as much as the 2013 does, including the bezel.

The frontlighting at max setting seems brighter and/or bluer-cooler than the 2013, but I don't know if that's because the 2013 lights are old. The 2018 still looks pretty white, but now it is closer to new white printer paper or styrofoam than the 2013 was to slightly yellowing/light cream 40-year old books. This difference seems to be from the light because at lowest brightness (the lights are still on) the difference is not as pronounced.

The frontlighting appears even to my eyes, no hotspots. My first 2013 unit, I had definite hotspots bad enough to show in photos, and near the middle of the display, the second 2013 unit, which is the one I have now, still has mild hotspots along the bottom of the display, but this 2018 unit has even more even lighting.

After updating to the latest software on each and opening up King in Yellow and setting both to the smallest and least bold Bookerly font, the 2018 seems a bit finer but still crisp and easier to read than the 2013, and setting the 2018 to the next bolder setting makes it a bit bolder than the 2013. The 2013 is still very readable but I'd say the 2018 is easier to look at, and flipping the screens upside down so the words are not distracting, the assessment remains. Again though, if I didn't have a side-by-side comparison, I wouldn't have noticed. Grayscale images have noticeably higher contrast on the 2018, although I don't have much use for that.

I can't say anything about the battery life yet, I give eink readers about a week after loading books before full charge and giving the battery a go, and my Kindle from gen 1, gen 3, gen 6 all had battery lives as expected. Responsiveness seems fine.

The size is close enough I can reuse my 2013 Paperwhite's folio case and TPU fitted back cover (not at the same time), which is good because I haven't seen any TPU back-only covers (I use mine with generic popsocket). There is a little bit more slop in the case, particularly around the bottom port and button, but the covers stay on and the charging port and button is still accessible. I have to read around if the usb port is waterproof like the rest of the unit without a port cover.

Specs are one thing, but it really does *feel* substantially lighter and thinner in my hand vs. the 2013. I wouldn't notice if I hadn't had one to compare but it should help a lot in my hours-long reading sessions.

Assuming the battery performs up to snuff I'm happy with paying $57 to get waterproofing and a new battery after 5 years on the 2013, and the flat front, smaller size, less weight are nice bonuses ($57 after the $100 December 2018 promotion, $25 trade in value on my 2013, and the additional 25% off with trade in offer). My time between upgrades are definitely getting longer though, so I can understand if people with Kindles less than 5 years old skip this one, even if Amazon stopped doing trade up deals like this one.

Anybody who doesn't have an eink reader yet, unless you read more than 2 hours a sitting and 4 hours a week, I think the cost of a new one is still better spent towards getting a better smartphone or a separate tablet, or printed books. E-ink readers are going to have to get a lot better on pricing or features if they are going to be more than devices for avid text and manga readers looking to ditch the space-weight requirements of physical books. $100 still seems like a lot if you already have a smartphone, and laptop (or tablet and desktop)--and this is coming from someone who early adopted the $400 Kindle 1st gen when it first came out 10 years ago, and upgraded to 3rd gen, 6th gen, and now the 10th gen (hmm at this rate I may not be upgrading until 15th gen). (Granted, the 2015 Paperwhite did sell for $80 a couple weeks ago new, and used units can also be cheaper).

It is a workhorse, a fairly specialized tool, and maybe that's enough, but since there aren't that many manufacturers in this market, I do worry that eink may disappear before other technologies can advance enough to take over eink's advantage in reading comfort and battery life."
Martín Elías Faúndez Valenzuela,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First, to start the review I have to mention that in the past I've had a Kindle (4th Gen) and there's a reference to compare it to. The outstanding thing on the new Paperwhite is the screen resolution. This thing holds up pretty well, and you really appreciate it when you have to read PDF's!
Also, I've been using the Everlast Rocketbook for more over than a year for college and other notes, so I enabled the PDF mailing function in the Kindle in order for me to send my notes over to it, and they are pretty well displayed thanks to this big resolution.
Battery life is okay if you are not a heavy reader, and in my experience is better to keep it in airplane mode and without the backlight on unless you need it.
It feels comfortable in the hand, and it feels sturdy, specially with the case on. The screen gets dirty easily, but as it's completely flat is easy to clean with any piece of cloth.
The only gripe I have with it is the absence of USB-C. Come on, we are in 2019 already!
On the software side everything works as expected. You don't buy a kindle expecting a screen and a navigation as fluent as your smartphone, but it's acceptably slow. The interface is not overwhelming, and it's easy to understand. What I like about it is the ability to customize it, and it allows me to put a clock on the top of the screen so I don't lose track of time when reading. Also, this thing allows connecting to wifi networks with a captive portal on them, which comes in handy when connecting on a cafe, a hotel or public spaces.
I'm overall very satisfied with my purchase!"
Avid Reader,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used the android Android Kindle app on my Samsung tablet for several years. I finally broke down and bought a PaperWhite, highly anticipating new features and functionality. To my disappointment, I had more features, faster speed, and COLOR on the Android app as compared to the reader.

For starters, the device is SLOOOOOW. I'd frequently find myself hitting an on screen button or link multiple times, only to find out that it had taken the first tap, it was just slow in loading/changing/doing what I wanted.

Secondly, EVERY TIME YOU TURN A PAGE, the screen flashes black for an instant. I found this INCREDIBLY distracting. This is a byproduct of the E-Ink screen and you can REDUCE it (but not by much) by going into settings and turning ""Page Refresh"" off. I did that. It reduced it from every page, to about every three pages. Still INCREDIBLY annoying.

I was looking for an enjoyable upgrade to my e-reading experience, but all I got was the hassle of returning this thing two days after I received it. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because Amazon is such a great company to do business with.

If you already have a tablet, save yourself some time and money. Download the free Kindle app. You'll save money while having a far more enjoyable reading experience."
M.C.A.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll boil it down for you. Here are the important new features of this model (4th Kindle Paperwhite, released in 2018):
-- flush screen (no bezels is a sleek upgrade and the correct design choice, although there is a visible color gradient at the screen's edge)
-- water resistant (probably shouldn't read it while scuba diving, but it can withstand a bath tub drop; cool)
-- Audible support, but only with Bluetooth headphones (listening to an Audible book demands the entire device's attention, so you're probably better off using the app on your phone anyway)

I upgraded from two Paperwhites ago, and the user experience feels mostly the same. I am glad for the 300ppi, which looks beautiful (my previous model had 212, and I could occasionally see pixels).

I will say that, although my previous Paperwhite also had the white ""Kindle"" logo at the bottom front, this one feels more distracting. Why have a contrasting color logo in plain view on a reading device? Seems silly and is my only real complaint. I know it's a Kindle without being told at the bottom of every page. I may cover it with black tape, which feels tacky but what can you do.

This model also appears to collect more fingerprints, though I'm using mine without a case now, which is probably a factor.

I should also note that, confusingly, this model takes longer to wake up if it's been sitting around asleep (maybe 30 minutes or more? I haven't measured). Why is a newer computer slower? Not a pet peeve, just strange.

Although I've read about charging and battery issues with this model, mine works perfectly. I typically keep it on airplane mode, which gives me 20-30 hours of reading time. That seems reasonable for an electronic device. Don't worry about negative battery reviews. You will most likely receive a device with a normal battery.

If you already have a Kindle Paperwhite, I'd say the upgrade is possibly worth it if you can find a deal and get a decent trade in. It's a tough call.

If you don't have an e-reader at all, stop balking and get this model. E-readers are a godsend, and this is your best bet for the next year. I read comics on my iPad and physical books when I receive them as gifts; otherwise, I read on this Kindle. I paid the extra money for no ads because I lead an ad-free life, but I'm told they're not bothersome and sometimes even advertisie great deals. I can't see a reason for mobile Internet connectivity for a dedicated e-reader. WiFi is perfectly fine.

Happy reading."
Kim,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle device, and I’m loving it! I’ve used the kindle app on my phone for years, but I’m starting to notice the eye strain from constantly using a phone to read. After talking to several friends who own a paperwhite, as well as reading the reviews, I decided to try it. It is small enough to take with me easily, which was a concern of mine. I have noticed a difference in the level of eye strain, which is a great thing! It’s super easy to download and buy books, as well as check out books from the library. It syncs with my phone well, even if it is a bit slower than I’d like. I love that it is water proof, as I love to read in the tub. The only complaint I have is in regards to the power button...why on earth would anyone think it’s a good idea to put a power button on the bottom of a device?!? I have accidentally turned it off several times while switching hands or just setting it on something. Other than that, I really do enjoy this device!

Update: I still love my Kindle Paperwhite, and recently bought one for my college son. He had rented 3 of his text books as digital ebooks from Amazon, and realized that he can’t have his phone out in class...which is where he was accessing the books thru the Kindle app. So we got him the newest Paperwhite, but when he tried to download his text books he received the error that none of them were accessible on the kindle device!!! What the heck?!? I contacted Amazon, and they searched the 3 books he rented, and all of them said they were compatible with the kindle app, but NOT the Kindle devices! However, my son ordered the books using the Amazon app on his phone. When looking at the book descriptions on the app, there is NO warning that they aren’t compatible! You can only see the warning using Amazon on a computer! Uggggggh!!! I just can’t begin to understand why the books would be ok with the app, but not the actual kindle device?!? Seriously frustrated right now!!! It is the perfect way to read books...especially text books! (A student can’t have their phones or tablets out in class, but can have a dedicated e-reader. Also, the great battery life, and ease on the eyes makes the Paperwhite the perfect solution!) Please fix this incredibly stupid over sight, Amazon!!!"
Crocophile,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in a keyboard Kindle and bought this one on Black Friday; still an extravagance to have an extra Kindle, but I will put it to good use. This 10th Kindle version is waterproof -- something I really haven't needed and expect not to put to the test. I like the new flat bezel design better. I also like the slightly grayish color of the screen -- still easy to read, maybe easier on the eyes. The lighting on this version is extremely even, much better than my older model.

I don't like the way the new Kindle is slower to ""wake."" I frequently put my Kindle down, do a lot of stop and start reading, and that little bit of lag, along with the message on the screen's botton edge telling me it's waking up, is a little annoying. I have not yet used this Kindle enough to know if there will be other functional issues."
W. Eden,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using a non touch screen /non built in light Kindle since they came out. To be honest, I like the buttons better than the touch screen for reading - I don't accidentally scroll two pages, and going back a page (or ten) is less finicky. That said, it was time to upgrade.

I love the light though, and the water-resistance. I'm not nervous taking it out on the beach to read. I obviously don't get the weeks of 4+hour a day reading I got on the old style non-lighted/non touch screen kindle, but I can go plenty of time between charges, and it charges quickly."
Amina H,1.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life is non-existent. I’ve spent hours with customer service and sent my brand new kindle back once already. It was returned to me claiming to be fixed and a day later the battery has dropped from 100% to 17% in airplane mode and not being used. I’m trying to return and even that is proving to be challenging with customer service.
Frederick Nunes,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My Kindle Voyage has gone to its grave after 2 1/2 years. I swore at that point to never overspend on a Kindle again. I caught this sale at $99.99 for the newest Paperwhite and bought one.

First, the bad. At this point, I do not understand Amazons thinking. By now, you would think they could come up with a better backing for their readers other than the fingerprint and oil from your skin magnet. This is an issue for anyone who prefers to hold the device in hand. If you use a book-styled cover? This is irrelevant. Secondly, for those who choose the non-ad version.... they use the same old boring screensavers as they have for years!! Why not have the actual book cover that you are reading for a screensaver? This is why at this point? Stick to the less expensive, ad version. At least you get variety and along with that, some good offers.

Now, for the performance. Looking at this in the front - it resembles the Voyage very closely. Holding it in hand for me is great. The display is sharp and the page turning is quicker than the Voyage. Now, I also own the last generation of Paperwhite. I chose this latest due to its low price, its flush bezel like Voyage) and its audible feature.

This is an e-reader that offers substance over style. At $99.99, you can buy 2 and still have 50 bucks left versus buying an Oasis. From my experience, there is no evidence that spending more yields a longer lasting product. Choose style (Oasis) or substance (New paperwhite) Lastly, I am looking to sell the last years version of the Paperwhite. I also now realize owning 2 is pointless. This is only my opinion."
DogsRunMyLife,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated review: I really wish I would have kept my one of my older Paperwhites. This new one has not worked with anywhere near the consistency that my older versions did. The screen has frozen multiple times necessitating hard restarts and in one case I had to completely de-register and re-register to get it working again. Often it is slow to wake. The bluetooth has been temperamental often not recognizing a speaker it was playing through the day before. Sometimes it will connect, sometimes it won't. Doesn't seem to be rhyme or reason. The battery doesn't seem as robust as my older Paperwhites and several times it drained to nothing within a couple hours of it being fully charged. With my normal reading of a couple of hours a day, the battery needs to be recharged weekly. My old Paperwhite seemed to last months before needing to be charged. One last little annoyance is the sensitivity (or maybe the location) of the on/off button. I can't remember if it is in the same place that it was in the older Paperwhites, but I am forever accidentally turning off my device while reading by touching the button. This never happened with the older versions. Overall, this newest version of Kindle Paperwhite has been a disappointment. I wrote to customer service, they said I'd need to call. Each time something

Original review: I was a slow Kindle adopter but now that I’m on board, I wouldn’t be without. Got a great deal on this new kindle by trading in two older models and getting a presale discount. Like the previous Paperwhite, it’s lightweight, easy to ready with one hand and this new one is waterproof (no more ziplock for tub reading) and has Audible (yay!) Not sure what more I could want."
Robert W. Thacker,1.0 out of 5 stars,We purchased the new paperwhite 06/25/19. The product was advertised as having better battery life than older versions. The battery life is actually terrible. With WiFi on the battery drains in 2 to 3 hours. With WiFi off (Airplane Mode) the battery life is less than one day. We returned the unit to Amazon. The 'refurbished' replacement sent to us has less battery life than the original new one. We have been given the 'run around' by the Kindle customer service people in the Philippines. We are now hoping to get a replacement that works. This is a disgusting situation for customers like us that have been using Kindle products for years. We would love have a refund for this defective product but Amazon is resisting our request.
anthony sherin,1.0 out of 5 stars,I traded in a 4 year old Kindle Voyager for new Paperwhite. After 4 years there are no improvements (except it's supposed to be waterproof) from Amazon. Instead the new Kindle slower and the battery life is not as good as a 4 year old Voyager. Shame on you Amazon. You get an F!
Swell,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite had such promise! I absolutely loved it for the first few days. Then it stopped working.

The device kept freezing, wouldn't start and did not hold a charge. When I tried to exchange it for a working one, the only options Amazon offered were a refund or a cumbersome IT support chat.

I spent 45 minutes on the useless chat, and despite my repeated requests to exchange it for a working product or to speak to a manager who could actually do something to help me, I was informed I had to send it back it for them to evaluate whether they could repair it.

Ultimately I ended up returning it for a refund. Unfortunately, I bought it on sale, so I won't be able to buy it again without paying much more than I paid when I first purchased it. Shame on you, Amazon. I won't be buying anymore Amazon devices."
Dave LaCroix,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this new Paperwhite because mine was several years old, and the battery had to be charged more frequently than when I got it, about once a week! When I bought my old one, it was advertised as being able to go a MONTH on a single charge, but I find that the new one has to be charged just as often as my old one did, which kind of defeats the purpose of buying a new one! Also, my old one was a LOT easier to hold! It has a rubberized feel to it, and easily stayed in my hands. The new one is the same slick plastic all over, and I find myself dropping it repeatedly! The new one is advertised as the lightest Kindle ever; technically, they are correct, the new one is a whopping 3/4 of an ounce lighter, barely perceptible! All in all, my ideal Kindle Paperwhite would be my old one with its original battery!"
StonelonesomeAQHA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered on Black Friday, received on Black Friday. 5 stars for shipping. Bought this to replace the Paperwhite I bought in 2017 and lost at the airport last week. Out of the box, it was easy to register, easy to download my almost 1,000 books, which all remained in the collections I had on my previous Paperwhite. It wakes up quickly, pages turn easily, font selection is just as easy. I can’t speak to battery life, because I’ve only had it for one day. I let the negative reviews of the 10th Gen Kindle scare me and I almost didn’t order it. Turns out that would have been a foolish mistake. While I’m sure that a flub will pop up once in a while, with the millions of devices sold and my always happy outcome with any Amazon returns, I’m going to trust that my Kindle experience will always be rewarding!"
dmoore,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This has been the worst kindle I have ever had, it keeps restarting it self, screen goes black or just shuts off. I called customer service it was awful. In the past I would have been sent a replacement and box to send old one back now you have to send your kindle in and wait until it is repaired and returned to you. I also bought the extended warrenty and they acted like I did not. I was told it was repaired, but it is still doing the same thing."
Catherine,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Disappointed...the navigation is elementary, am quite shocked. Page turning is clumsier than the original, which is hard to imagine, it skips pages easily, bookmark doesn't always work....forget typing a note..even the highlighting is clumsy. Browsing is also impossible.
Its like the Kindle went backwards."
BCoontz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't bought an e-reader in 8 years. I am so glad I waited to get the 2018 paperwhite. So different from my other Kindle. Love the backlight for it, makes reading in any light much easier. The battery will go pretty quick, if your reading a lot. I have a tendancy to ""binge read"" a series, so it lasts about 2 1/2 books, 1000 plus pages. Before I feel compelled to charge it. 2 things I'd do differently, one, not buy the bigger GB, I borrow from the library a lot... pretty much unnecessary, as you return them. Secondly, spring for no ads, they're just... annoying. If you don't upgrade a lot, but you're thinking about it, definitely worth it. I'm glad I did."
Tommy Bishop,5.0 out of 5 stars,An absolutely perfect device for what I need. This thing goes everywhere with me. This is my first e-reader and I don't think I could ever go back to normal paper books.
Chief of Stuff,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Kindle Voyage and found one day a hairline crack in the screen. Unfortunately, even though it was barely even visible it rendered the touchscreen inoperable so I replaced it with the latest Paperwhite and have been sorely disappointed.

First, the power button on the bottom is a TERRIBLE design. It's somehow always in the way and gets triggered accidentally far too frequently. It wouldn't be as bad if I could change the orientation so I could use the device upside down but that's not an option.

The time to turn pages seems much longer than on the Voyage, enough that I notice it each time.

The touchscreen responsiveness is terrible. There's significant touch latency.

I miss the adaptive brightness (that automatically adjusts based on light levels) from the Voyage. It wasn't perfect on that device but now it's missing entirely.

I also wish it used USB-C since that's the direction most phones are going in and I'd rather not bring multiple charging cables.

As for the features they added, they're nice, but I don't really use any of them. Waterproofness is definitely nice to have though I've never had a device get wet so it's not a huge deal for me. The Bluetooth isn't really necessary since I just use my phone for Audible. In fact I almost always have Airplane mode turned on on the Kindle to save battery and as a result my books aren't synced.

This is a regression in almost every regard from previous generations."
Jim C.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace my admittedly old Paperwhite (purchased 2012, second generation of paperwhite I think), which has been getting slower and occasionally hanging). Most of the obvious differences between the two are minor. The flush bezels are a nice touch, although you do lose the feedback about how close your finger is to the edge of the screen. The new one is faster, smoother operating and doesn't hang, but it's also 6 years younger. The new display is a little better matte which should make it easier to read around lights, but I never had any complaints with the old surface. Character display looks a little improved - the advertise better resolution and there may be better contrast under the same lighting conditions. I like the new hardware, particularly the waterproof claim, since I used to have to use a ziplock when I got near water.

There have been several improvements in the Paperwhite software over the years that look like they may be useful, but it will take a while to explore them all.

My only real complaint is battery life. I typically read several hours per day, background light on around 10, connected to a nearby 5GHz wifi. Under these conditions, I am not sure I can achieve a full week without recharging. The biggest drain on these devices always seems to be wifi - on my last one if I turned wifi off I could reliably achieve a couple weeks. Bigger batteries are heavier, so I won't say that Amazon has made the wrong trade-off. It just means I will need to be careful to turn off wifi if I go on a long trip."
Aundra-Lyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle I've had and I LOVE it, I'm so happy I finally bought one. What sold me, finally, was that I could change the text size. I kept ordering books that ended up having really small print that was hard and unenjoyable for me to read. I held off on buying a Kindle for a long time because I mainly read in the bath, but when I saw this one was waterproof I decided to give it a shot. I'm still hoping I never completely drop it in there but I've had no issues with water splashing on it like I have with other devices that aren't waterproof in the past.

I thought the process of switching from physical books to a Kindle would be more difficult but it wasn't at all. It's very easy to get used to and ultimately a much ""smoother"" way to read. Also love that it connects to Goodreads, and it's much lighter than I expected too. It's also nice because my bookshelf is already overflowing, don't need to worry about that anymore either.

If you've been curious about getting a Kindle but been putting it off for years like me, this is the one you should get. It's totally worth it!!"
flyfish,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered the paperwhite for my wife's birthday. came a few days before birthday. I was checking to make sure it worked,when I discovered that the charging cable would not fit. I believe the the kindle itself was defective. Returned it for a refund. Will wait until the kinks are worked out."
Jason W,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been reading on an older Kindle Paperwhite 2nd generation for years. It was still working perfectly fine and there was probably no need to upgrade except for slightly diminished battery life, but here's why I'm really happy I decided to trade it in for the newest Paperwhite:
- My old paperwhite couldn't update to the latest version of the OS these devices run. The new version changes the interface around - both in the home screen and the reading interface - in nice ways. The old one said it was up to date and I think the new software was only supported by the improved hardware capabilities. Page turns and navigation around my library feels a bit faster in this new Kindle.
- Better screen. I can tell. I think there's higher DPI, but most noticeably if the improved light. My old paperwhite wasn't bad but I could notice slight shadows. This new one is evenly lit with nice crisp fonts.
- Better bezel. On the old paperwhite, the screen was recessed in a plastic bezel. Once I had the new one in my hands, that old design immediately felt outdated. Plus, the way we all used to love a fresh, new, nicely printed book is the same reason I always want to read on a nice clean screen. Whenever I would clean up my old Kindle, it would just push the dust and build-up into the edges where stuff would get stuck in the crevice of the bezel. Then you turn the screen light on and it makes the nasty stuff practically glow. The new screen design can be wiped down perfectly. I know it seems petty but you know it matters.

There's other improvements, of course, but I'm not testing the water resistance and I've never had enough books to run out of storage.

I miss my old case, and I haven't bought a new case yet. The edges of the Kindle are nice and thick and rubbery and there's a slightly raised edge around the screen, so I think I'm good for a while without a case. I like that Kindles have always kind of a matte finish to the screen that prevents glare but also prevents the inevitable fine scratches that happen to our glossier screens.

I would highly recommend anyone who has an old Kindle to consider trading it in for this one before it quits working and loses it's value. It might not seem like much there's much difference with the newer model, but all the little things come together to make for a noticeable improvement, and I'm thinking this one will last me another 6 years of reading."
Susan B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received my new Kindle Paperwhite, couldn t be happier. The outlet for the charge cord wiggled so much I could not charge it. when I was finally able to get the cord to connect it took hours for it to charge. Time for a new kindle. First I ordered it before the holidays and paid $99.00, that being said, I would have been happy paying the $129.00. When I received it, I immediately charged it, the cord provided worked for me, I've read some people have had issues, thankfully I was good. Upon registering, my collections, with the books were immediately available, in the past I had to set them up individually. Has the same adjustable light, fonts as my previous kindle had. I like the 300 PPI text, it is thinner and lighter, I don't get a glare on the screen. it is maybe a 1/4 of inch smaller, so if you want a cover, which I did, make sure you get one that it indicates it will fit ONLY the new 10th generation, 2018. I bought one from UUcovers and it fits perfectly.. The only issue I have is the ""includes special offers,"" which is no more than ads when you power up, and you need to ""slide"" the ads away to begin reading, frustrating to say the least. In order to have them disabled, call Amazon, ask for kindle , then the teamleadership division and they will disable for a cost of $15.00, and request, nicely, that you do not want to be charged. I had mine disabled at no charge."
Khawes,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Kindle paperwhite excited about not having to charge it after 12 hours of reading. I have a Kindle Fire currently. I have hundreds of books in my Kindle Account and I subscribe to Kindle Unlimited. The Paperwhite is the size of a child's board book with a much smaller screen. The type allows for only 3 print sizes, and the compact is larger than what I would normally use: about a 10 point. There is no Arial Narrow option in the font options. Result? 1/3 less words on each page.
2: The page of lists of books that I can read from my account only allows 3 at a time. The remainder of page is filled with ""recommended readings"" for me. I want to read what I have, not what they want to sell me. To get away from constant sales efforts I had to go to list mode. And it was almost impossible to read 2 or 3 different books in a day, because the old ""touch and it opens"" only works if you can get to the list.
3. When a book is finished, it automatically makes me review on Goodreads. Then there is no button to submit so I could pull up my other books. It is not counted as read unless I wade through the back 10 pages with all the authors thank you notes, and excerpts from their next new novel. It makes the reader continually try to pull up the function screen at the top. But it keeps taking me back to reviewing on Goodreads. There is a function that allows me to designate a book as read, but I could not figure out how to mark an uninteresting book and make it disappear as READ or No Interest.
The cost of this paperwhite is substantially more, and I would have paid it, as I go everywhere with it. I read when I am waiting in lines. It seemed that Amazon is spending more time trying to sell me books and utilize their Goodreads acquisition, than looking at what my needs as a serious reader entail. I need lots of pages, fewer touches, and the old software gives me that.
If I want to search for a book, I can go online and find one at Amazon. I absolutely do not need a ""recommended reading for you"" that fills more than 1/2 a page, instead of my book list. I read the entire Paperwhite user manual. I used the Paperwhite for 2-3 weeks and then decided to send it back. A longer battery is not worth the other changes."
K. Oue,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I guess I jumped the gun with my purchase of the new Oasis in the summer. Prior to that I had always used a 5th generation kindle (1st or 2nd gen paperwhite), and I loved it. I had always wanted a waterproof version for use when soaking in the bath or hot tub. At over $200, it was hard to justify but I pulled the trigger.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed for many reasons (you could see my review for more details) but perhaps the biggest drawback was something I had not considered when looking into a new kindle: size. The Oasis was too large to fit in my pocket, which turned out to be quite burdensome in many situations. Thankfully, this new paperwhite is the same size as the old one.

Ive only had it a few days now, but I have not discovered any issues. Sure, it doesn't have as many LEDs or active lighting control or buttons, but I wasn't really looking for those in the first place, and at this price point, I will not complain. The lack of active content for new kindles is regrettable, but I've learned to live without them these past few months. For people simply looking to read e-books anywhere, anytime, this new paperwhite is perfect.

As for the Oasis... my less discerning wife can have it!"
Joshua S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally rated this a 1 star. Amazon sent me a new USB cable. After further research I realized my headphones where using an outdated Bluetooth profile. I feel Amazon should make the Bluetooth requirements more visible on their sales page. Many devises are capable of connecting to older Bluetooth profiles, but the Kindle Paperwhite will only connect to devices using the A2DP profile.

The Kindle works as expected otherwise. The touch response seems clunky compared to the previous Paperwhite. I feel shipping with a bad cable and the issues with Bluetooth devices are things that should not have happened.

Was excited to get this for the Audible and Bluetooth connectivity. First. The provided USB cable will not fit the USP port on the device. Second. It WILL NOT connect to my headphones. I get it, not adding the 3.5 headphone jack, actually I don't really get it, but I was aware before I bought it and I won't complain beyond that. However, if it has audio book capabilities, and it is being limited to Bluetooth then it should work with all Bluetooth audio devices. Bluetooth is not just a wireless method, but it has a set of standards. I expect that if it says Bluetooth, then it should work with any Bluetooth headphone. Neither the sales page or the online manual provide a list of ""supported"" devices. HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO KNOW WHAT DEVICES WORK AND WHAT DEVICES DON'T."
Neomass,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll start emotionally: I HATE THIS THING SOOOOO MUCH...HATE IT, HATE IT, HATE IT, HATE IT.

More seriously now:
This particular Kindle reader locks up, freezes, is slow responding, and data connection is slower than dial-up (wonder how many will get this).
The chances of getting an Amazon defective product is about 20% vs Google's that is less than 0.01%.
Not even talking about UI or performance issues which Amazon tech has a lot.
But it's worse, Amazon is garbage (bad company all around), bad tech, bad practices, bad logistics, and the worst part is that they acquire good technologies and manage to screw it all up afterwards.
This is in context because these poor practices sometimes break designs, break the product itself, or makes the product susceptible to breakage later on (e.g. stops working after a few months).

I'll provide context so you understand why this opinion matters. Not bragging.
I'm a technology and management expert. I consult at very high rates for large and small tech companies as well as GOV, got degrees in Engineering and Computer Sciences, and sold tech my companies developed to GOV and large private alike. Over 20yrs working on this field, even sold tech to Amazon affiliates (can't disclose more).

Life is too short to be wasting it in returning things that don't work and/or work terribly.
Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY from Amazon tech.
From AWS and fire sticks to Alexa and its devices they all have so many problems. It's all half-baked.
I've seen them make decisions and it's sad how Amazon's main strategy is market saturation to achieve larger market share as opposed to provide good technology and services. In some aspects they are similar to how Walmart handles supply chain.

I have my own issues with Google, Samsung, MS, or even Apple but at least their stuff works well (or well enough)."
Terry Curtis,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only owned this since May and the battery life has dropped off significantly. I can't get through the day without recharging.
The touch screen on this one is so sensitive that it jumps pages without swiping the screen.
I also lost the ability to open the books in my library, but finally recovered them by doing total reset."
mepa,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have enjoyed having a Kindle for all these years for ease in obtaining the books, and portablity of the units. I have not enjoyed the repeated problems with the units I have had, which has become consistent in the last for 4 units which I have tried and returned, from November 29 2019 to Jan 1 2020 (in 2 months). Problems encountered were consistent, despite if I asked for a replacement and got a refurbished one, or I ask for refund and bought a new one with higher price. Unit problems as follows: #1 New Model April 2011 Stopped working completely; (2 1/2 y/old)
#2 Refurbished Model August 2013 Began skipping pages without prompting and freezing on a page requiring reboot
#3 Oct 1913 Replaced with refurbished model same problems. (after 2 mo)
#4 July 2018 NewModel New Papewhite 300ppi, high resolution, problems same as 2. (after 4 1/2 yrs)
#5 Nov 2019 New Model paper white waterproof, 2x storage, Discount Christmas special, problems Freezing on page aprox every 1-2 pages consistently, reboot required, did not always return to correct page, changing Font and boldness degrees without prompting. Requested refund to get New unit, had to pay regular price. (after 1 1/2 years)
#6 Dec 6, 2019, New model Same as number 5, but now included at least daily indication power problem, requiring rebooting.

Jan 17, 2020 So today I again return this last unit ( used less that 20 days) after talking yet another representative, don't get me wrong I have had no problem the support teams, but it is just getting old. Will buy another NEW one and see if they can get right this time. Eternal Optimist I guess. Just can't see trying any other companies e-readers, who knows they might not be any better."
reader922,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought primarily because my old Paperwhite was starting to act up, like freezing up, turning off, etc, so with the discount and trade in of old kindles, and 6 months of Kindle Unlimited this was a great deal. So far, I do not find it any different from my previous Paperwhite from 2015. So if your old Kindle Paperwhite is working just fine, you may choose to just keep it. But if it is time for a new one, this is great. The Paperwhite Kindle is a great e-reader. A separate issue of the cover: because Amazon makes each new reader a slightly different size, it requires the purchase of a new cover, if you use a cover. I bought the leather cover,which I think is a little expensive plus the edge of the cover is too sharp. Maybe later versions will be better"
JB,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my wife to replace her Kindle Fire. I was about to buy a new Fire but realized my wife doesn't use it for anything but reading. She uses her phone for checking email and the web. Plus, the fire really doesn't function well as a tablet. The Paperwhite is super light and she is able to read print even in bright light."
Keri,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My Kindle Keyboard broke the first weekend in November, after 8 years of use. Sometimes heavy use, but a lot of time spent on my nightstand, because honestly I prefer regular books to ebooks - but not having the e-ink reading option if I wanted it was irritating, so with a little research, I bought the new Paperwhite.

After 3 weeks, it works fine. I like that unlike the previous versions of the Paperwhite, I can turn the backlight off completely, which may not make much of a difference to battery life, but makes me feel better about it. I also like the size - not having the keyboard buttons at the bottom makes the device a little more convenient.

I don't like not having actual buttons to press to turn pages. I've had a difficult time with my taps not registering or overregistering, and the left-turn space is way too small. The thing desperately needs discrete buttons on each side to improve the page-turn experience. Also, I'm constantly turning pages instead of accessing the top menu, which is frustrating, and even though the page-location slider is at the bottom, I have to tap at the top to get it to open, which is not intuitive at all. (More pages turned unexpectedly!)

But these are all complaints about a button-free experience, and I simply can't afford an Oasis device to get my buttons back. I've thought about looking for a gently used Keyboard elsewhere, or seeing if someone can repair mine, but I do really like the soft backlight when i'm reading at night - I set it to 3 or 4 - and I like the smooth screen. The lack of corners means when I'm inevitably eating croissants or the like, I don't end up with little crumbs crushed into the crevices.

The back of the device is a soft-texture plastic which picks up finger-grease like nothing I've ever seen. Within ten minutes of opening it up and turning it on, even though my hands were clean and dry, it was kind of gross looking. I immediately went to buy a case for it.

I don't like that I can't turn the device off completely. The best I can do is remember to turn on Airplane Mode, then turn the screen off. This caused problems with turning pages and memory after about 2 weeks and loading in my library, where the device hung or stuttered and I had to force a restart. It would be nice if I could simply shut the thing off when I'm not going to be reading for a while, and not have to worry about those restarts.

It's also a bit frustrating that the USB connector is still the old version, not a USB-C, which most of my other devices have switched to. I had been looking forward to being able to reduce the number of cables I keep around for charging.

So I guess on the whole, I dislike the Paperwhite because it isn't a Keyboard, and because I have always been mistrustful of/had bad experiences with touch-only input, but I've found myself liking the new features more than I expected. I'm certainly glad I paid a little extra for the 2018 model instead of a refurbished/dead stock of the previous version, or the regular Kindle. I just wish it had actual buttons."
Emopausal,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First thoughts about this Kindle is: SLOW. This isn't a tablet nor, obviously, does it have the processing speed/capability of a tablet making the overall experience a bit frustrating as you issue a command via a screen touch then watch the tablet wheeze and weeble to perform the request. It reminds me a lot of the first-generation kindles; there's little difference (to me) of the Paperwhite (in terms of performance and features) from the first generation kindle except it's got lights.

The light is ok - I've not figured out how to read without it/turn-it off which is annoying.

Equally annoying is the inability to get a sharp contrast screen. Unlike the kindle apps (android), you can flip the reading from black-on-white to white-on-black with two taps. For the kindle device, it's an easter egg hunt where you eventually end-up in the disability settings to invert the color. Then, what you get isn't a true black background with white text, it's more of an anemic gray scale that only gets worse if you attempt to dial-down the brightness. Geh.

Battery life is what you expect from a kindle - awesome. And, for what you're using this device for, it performs ok. The portability combined with the screen size/feel is what makes me drop this in my backpack and not use the kindle app on my 10"" tablet.

Navigating the store and your library is an absolute pain in the tortillas. The Kindle UI is just a mess. It's slow to the point of being non-responsive and whomever has organized the layout obviously hasn't taken the struggling CPU into account. (Example: simple page scrolling.) In terms of functionality, it's not a lot better; I've not yet figured out how to search my library (for a title/author) without the search tool (that was launched from your library page), to not end-up searching the kindle store instead.

Overall, I'd give the Kindle app (Android) much higher reviews in terms of usability alone than I would the kindle device. Hopefully, for these little monochromatic kindles, Amazon will invest in better backing hardware and update the UI so you have a fully-functional feature set comparable to it's same-named software.

If I were to make this purchasing decision again, I'd pass. You're paying 2019 prices for 2009 hardware and software. Cut the price in half, at least, before this kindle become a bargain at it's current configuration."
CIzac,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this a couple weeks ago (11/23) to replace the one I bought 2 years ago that just broke. From the time I got it I knew something was wrong. First, the cord shipped with it didn't even fit it. Why would you ship a cord with an item if you know it doesn't fit. The customer service rep said they were having issues with the cords and that they don't fit. Then after they shipped me a cord, It was very slow at 'waking' up. I hadn't even use it that much since I got it because I have had lots of time home and I read on my computer when I am home. Well sure enough one day I go to read my Paperwhite and nothing. It doesn't come on at all although it was fully charged. It was basically displaying the signs like my old one that just broke. I am in the process of returning this. I am now scared to buy another one. Should I? Shouldn't I? I'm reading other reviews to see if I should. I am presently using my PC and iPhone to read my books. UPDATE: I did end up getting another one but honestly I am not confident that it won't break soon. It takes a while to 'wake'. It never sync. I read on my computer sometimes and would just stop and switch to the Kindle - right close to each other and it wouldn't sync. My iPhone sync but not the Kindle."
Hugh Cowart,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Caught mine on special for 80 bucks so it was pretty much impulse territory. I got the second gen Kindle many moons ago and loved it but it was a very quirky device and the 120dpi screen was not what I had hoped it would be. Once iPad hit 300dpi screen resolution I really stopped keeping an eye out for the mythical hi rez e-ink e-reader that had been promised. They did finally pop up but were typically too expensive to justify in addition to my iPad. The only complaint I have about the paperwhite is also one of its advantages in some circumstances. That is its size. The device is overall about the foot print of a very thin paperback... think 100-150 pages. This means the screen is somewhat smaller than a typical paperback page and there are still margins inside that. So if you are a fast reader (and maybe have the font size bumped up a bit because your eyes are not what they used to be) you are flipping pages at a pretty good clip. Fast enough that the short (but noticeable) page load can become somewhat irksome. But it lasts multiple days on a charge and doesn't take up much space... and unlike my original kindle it isn't a massive risk to read with it in a tub or by a pool, and it has a backlit screen for reading at night to go along with that magical 300dpi (printed page quality) resolution all at a pretty affordable price. Ambient lit E-ink still makes for a better reading screen than backlit high res IPS/OLED screens. But I have found this backlit E-ink is really much of a muchness when it comes to low light. Overall: Solid well sorted device for those who love to read but hate lugging tons of books around or constantly having to find a plug to top up when reading long form content."
Mainiac,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this ""upgraded"" version of the Kindle PW for the audible books feature. What a mistake ! The audiobook feature used Bluetooth to connect to earbuds and this sucks the battery down incredibly quickly. This combined with the general high battery use (even in airplane mode with the wifi and BT off) makes the device need charging an a daily (sometimes multiple times) basis. Even setting on the shelf with all wifi,bt and the screen shut off the thing will kill the battery in a week. I traded my older PW 3 version in when I purchase this one and I'm kicking myself for the oversight.
I find I now use the kindle app on my tablet instead of the kindle. It's more comfortable, reliable and uses less battery.
I've enjoyed my kindles over the years, but I don't see myself buying another at this point."
"Pamela H., Las Vegas",1.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is supposed to have come with built-in wi-fi (which it does - recognizes wifi signals and connected to my home (one of the very few places where I'm comfortable connecting to a wi-fi network)); however, when I was at the club pool I wanted to download a book and was unable to do so. This is the 2nd Kindle Paperwhite I've received within 30 days that states it comes with BOTH WIFI & CELLULAR CONNECTIONS and yet the device is missing this very important component. The whole purpose for buying this model was for the connection. I can waterproof my 11 year old Kindle by inserting it into a quart size ziplock bag and it works just fine. I wanted to be able to finish 1 book and immediately download another either from my library or by buying a new one, but Amazon failed miserably on this one. Utterly disappointed that the rates keep increasing and the service keeps decreasing."
David,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit: reduced rating to 4 stars because after two weeks the backlight failed. About half the screen no longer illuminates on its own. I'm going to return it. However, I have enjoyed using the kindle enough that I'm willing to give it another try. I will buy another one (with a protection plan) just to see if maybe this was a defective unit.

Edit: I also bought the Kindle Oasis with Warmlight because I wanted to see a comparison. The Oasis was okay, but I don't think it was worth $250. I ended up returning the Oasis in favor of this one.

PHOTO: It is a bit hard to make it out in a photo, but in real life it's very clear. The backlight in the bottom right half of the screen is not working. That isn't a shadow, it's the light.

I want to address 4 things, good and bad, that I see listed in most reviews: Glare, Waterproof, Backlight, and Size/Weight. I have been very interested in buying this for a while but I held off. I had the original paperwhite back around 2012 when it first came out, but I accidentally broke it. So while I don't have a recent comparison to make, I did know what my original expectations and impressions were for the product. I believe this product fits the bill. I am very happy about it.

Glare: Biggest complaint I see in other reviews is about glare. In my experience with it so far, I barely notice the glare. Now this is coming from someone who hasn't used this product in almost 7 years, so I don't remember what the glare was like before. But, if you are someone who hasn't used a kindle, I suspect you will be in the same boat as I and won't even notice it. There is a bit of glare, but not at all comparable to what you would get on a glossy iPad or Kindle Fire. In direct sunlight it reads just fine as well.

Waterproof: The tablet is waterproof. One of the first things I did was throw it in my pool. I specifically bought this thing so that I could read by the pool, so if it didn't hold up to this test then it would have to be returned. It worked just fine. I even quickly dunked in in the hot tub for good measure and it was the same result. That being said, there is one downside I noticed. In one video review on youtube I saw the reviewer said that the touch screen gets disabled underwater. From what I saw this was not the case. I think he was using cold water while my pool was maybe a little warmer? Either way, my tablet was reacting to an ""invisible hand"" and all kinds of things were getting pressed, settings, brightness, font size, and pages were getting moved randomly. It is possible to deactivate touch controls, and I don't plan to read underwater so this wasn't a huge deal, more of a mild annoyance.

Backlight: Something I was concerned about was eye fatigue. I was really considering the Kindle Oasis because of the new ""warmlight"" feature, however I'm glad I gave this a shot first. It's a very soft light, which is the effect of the lights pointing in at the screen instead of out at your eye. In day and night reading I didn't experience any issue, even after extended periods of reading. I actually find the faint white-blueish glow to be very calming, and with brightness control, there is no chance that you can't find a setting that suits your preference and environment.

Size/Weight: The size was originally something I was concerned about. In store I thought this tablet looked really small (when sitting next to it's other big tablets) and while this is the case, I think this is a strong point of the design. It's very small and light. When I used to hold up the fire or iPad, I used to think they were kind of heavy. However holding this, one reviewer said it felt ""hollow and cheap"" but I think it's very light and pleasant. For something I hold up to my face for hours at a time, a light weight is a huge benefit. And even the size is very pleasant. I don't feel like I'm reading a tiny, cramped, screen. It feels fine to me. And I love that I can easily fold over the cover and throw it in my pocket and not even think about it."
Janet Blair,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd Paperwhite and I love it. I have traded up twice now. Finally it has the reverse contrast text feature, and that is the one thing I missed from my old Nook touch (it is under Accessibility in settings)/ plus it is waterproof so now I can read in the bath. The battery lasts a really long time, at least a week or more, and that is with a lot of use."
Saltwater Soul,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s very lightweight, and I love the memory capacity on this... However, I am just really annoyed by the placement of the power switch. What genius decided putting it on the bottom of the kindle is a good idea? It’s where you hold the kindle - at the bottom, so you’re more likely to press this stupid button and put it into sleep mode while holding it. It would’ve been perfect on the top. I HATE THIS FEATURE. It just doesn’t make sense to me.
The touch screen is a bit delayed on mine. I touch to turn a page and it doesn’t do anything, touch again then it flips two pages. Quite annoying. The ads when it goes to sleep are pretty obnoxious. It’s always some shirtless dude in an advert for a cheesy romance novel. I wish I’d paid the extra $20 to remove it, but at this rate I’m already in the hole a bit for this kindle. So I’m leaving it as is for now. I’m not in love with this kindle for those reasons, but I do like it for its convenience. Things I do like about it, is highlighting as I read, notes, and being able to tap a word for a quick definition. Helps me beef up my vocabulary as I read. I love saving money on books and just buying kindle versions. Also saves me on space since I am a voracious reader and have WAY too many books as is. Holding this is way easier on my hands than a big heavy hardback book. So points for that. I love that it’s waterproof. Haven’t tested that out yet, but I have a tendency of spilling water on my nightstand - so it’s nice to know I won’t have to worry about ruining my investment. I put a PopSocket on the back of my Kindle also, which really helped with comfort of holding my Kindle for long periods of time. I’ll definitely have a Kindle in my future. I do recommend it - just be aware it’s not quite perfect yet."
Jealith,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a lefty. For me this has to be one of the worst kindles I have ever had. It's my third. The first two didn't need a cover to keep it from shutting off if I rested it on a surface. This one has the on/off button on the bottom. Dumb idea. With the cover it weighs twice as much as my last kindle. The last two I could hold in either hand and just by flexing my thumb could turn a page. The advance page on this one is only on the right so if I hold it in my left hand, normal for me, I have to swipe with my right. I do not exaggerate when I say my right arm is actually sore from swiping pages. Must be a great idea for people who don't actually read a lot. Care must be taken so you only advance one page. Three months in and I still have times when the thing jumps 5-6 pages and then has a problem going back. Swipe 10-15 times just to get back to the correct page to continue reading. Last two kindles I had all my saved books in ordered collections. This one I can't figure out how to manage that and there is no way to get to the cloud to find books I already have and want to read but it will easily take you to the store so you can buy them-again. Forget search. I have typed in the name of books I own and they don't come up so I have to go online, download them and then try to find them in the kindle library. Good luck with that. With this setup I wonder why I needed all that extra room. The light? As far as I can tell it isn't actually needed unless you read in the dark, just a waste of battery power. The one thing I do appreciate is the fact I do not need to recharge every day. I'm saving up to buy a different version kindle that doesn't have a button on the bottom or a touch screen if I can find one. Maybe check out other reading devices."
TechGeek,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 7th or 8th Kindle. I purchased it to replace my trusty Kindle Voyage (after rejecting the Oasis last year). Reasons for upgrade: I have only 1Gb left available on my Voyage (so I purchased the 32Gb model) and the added water resistance was appealing.

On arrival, I set up my WiFi and went to the Amazon website on my laptop to send my library to the new device, leaving the device plugged in. With the device fully charged, I settled into bed and read for 20 minutes before closing the cover to shut off the screen. Next morning: zero charge.

I plugged the device back in for a full 12 hour charge. Last night, once again, I read for 20 minutes. This morning, I have about 10% battery.

This is unacceptable. Yes, my WiFi was still on. But if a device manages WIFI Use so poorly that you lose a full charge overnight, then you will never be able to rely on it as a travel companion.

So this is going back.

My tip: pick up a Kindle Voyage and pray they refresh that model with more memory soon."
Runa Fernanda,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got my new Kindle Paperwhite that is supposed to be better than previous ones. I find it the same as my old one except that the battery runs down faster. Weeks of battery life on one charge--serious overstatement. If I use it in exactly the same way as my old one, the battery will not last even a week, if that long. It has dropped 20% in one day. The old one never did that even with many hours of use. The ""airplane mode"" is a nuisance to use, and yet it seems to be the only way to save on battery use, and even then it's not saving much, at least so far as I can tell. If I want to use any of the features such as looking up the meaning of a word in the text, I have to switch off the airplane mode, then switch it back on again to save battery juice. I don't see that as a feature but rather a bug. Now, if there is something I am missing, and there is a secret of some sort about the battery use, I'd really like to know. Anyone?"
Laura,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth kindle. Yes, I am an early adopter. Yes, I love technology. However, with my kindles, I don't jump just because Amazon has a new one each year; I needed to be wooed.

WOO me, Amazon DID!

Water resistant? YES!
More memory? YES!
Better battery? YES!
Brighter screen? YES!
More intuitive layout? YES!

I'm trying to find a con and I truly can't! I even traded in my old one and got a credit towards the new one! I use my kindle for at least an hour every single day, sometimes significantly more.

I would hesitate to buy it again, gift it and I HIGHLY endorse it! Do yourself a favor and buy yourself something pretty!"
Dink Dingerson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely tiny.

Ever tried reading a book on a cellphone? That’s going to be your experience with this. I took the box out of the box they shipped it and I thought “wow this thing is kind of small.” And then I unboxed the actual Kindle and it’s about the size of a large cell phone. It’s basically big enough to put a tiny picture inside of and set on your nightstand. I even compared it to some of the actual books I have around and I have no books that are as small as this goofy thing.

How am I supposed to read something on this? It’s absurd. It doesn’t even have a magnifying glass with it which is what one would need to even see a full page on a book on it.

I’m not even turning it on at all. I’m going to return it right away. Highly disappointed."
DiDi,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the first Kindle ever and loved it. Fast forward 20 years or so, and I haven’t read as much - or I’ve used an iPad or my phone. I was away last month and decided I really need to be able to read in the sun. So I picked this up.

I am just not one bit impressed. I much prefer how the books are managed on the iPhone. There just seems to be no rhyme or reason to how they are there. Also I find the touchscreen to be a beat behind every time.

Reading is great for sure. But the organization and technology is terrible in my opinion. Reminds me of something that just hadn’t caught up to the 21st century yet.

And the battery doesn’t last for weeks if you use it a fair amount."
anny11,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older version Paperwhite that I loved a lot, but it started to deteriorate and the screen stopped responding to touch. It became quite frustrating so I ordered a new 10th generation Paperwhite. Now I'm frustrated for different reasons. I love the lighter weight, sleek look, and smooth feel of the 10th generation Paperwhite. The text is sharp and I like be able to adjust the brightness.

What frustrates me to no end is that Whispersync does not work on the new device. I often download books to my Kindle and then also download the audio version from Audible. With my previous Paperwhite, going between the Kindle and Audible was seamless. I'd open the book on the Kindle or in Audible and get a message about going to my furthest read position. It went back and forth, no problems.

With the 10th generation Paperwhite, Whispersync only works one way--Audible will tell me where my furthest read position is, but I do not get the same message on the Kindle. I've worked through all their troubleshooting tips. No dice. I've spent hours on the phone trying to get help. No dice. Amazon let me return one device and sent another, and it didn't work either. It's extremely frustrating. I hope Amazon does something to resolve this issue. Whispersync was a feature I really enjoyed and I hate having spent this money and not getting something that works as it is supposed to."
RBN,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like how light it is.

I even pull the Paperwhite out of the cover when I can if I'm reading for a bit.

I probably would have gotten a sleeve instead of the fabric cover, even though I like the cover, if I had known how much I liked how much I liked the lightness.

The rubberized case that the Paperwhite comes with feels good but you can see fingerprints on it easily.

I like the screen and the customizability.

After about 4 hours of use battery is at 75% so I highly doubt that it'll last weeks for me but the Paperwhite battery life seems ok... probably better than the Fire.

I really which that I could flip the screen to any side that I want (you can only flip it to two of the four possibilities so the power button location can be a problem for some), but there is one minor issue that almost made me want to return it:

Even with refresh turned off, the screen flashes all black when you turn pages.

Customer Service tried but didn't really help.

I finally realized that with refresh off, the screen only flashed black for page turns when there was a small gear icon floating around the page, and it wasn't every time I turned the page so currently I'm leaning toward not returning it because the reason I got the Paperwhite was so I don't drain my phone battery when I'm not at home...I use my phone heavily.

We'll see."
Chemmamma,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought an original Paperwhite in 2012 and have loved it. It finally started to have some issues and will be handed down to my daughter soon. I found the new on on sale and bought it for a replacement.

First of all, I like that there are much more choices available for font sizes. I'm getting older and like ""large print"". The older device had about 6 or so sizes with a huge jump between the largest and second to largest. It was either slightly too small, or 15 words on a page. The new one is much more flexible and seems to have several sizes in between. Good for my middle-aged eyes.

Like other reviewers, I dislike that it goes to full brightness when it ""wakes up"". The old one was either off or on, and never ""woke up"". The light decreases to your set brightness after the wake cycle is complete, but it is jarring to have the bright light suddenly shine at you when you are trying to read in bed.

I'm personally not fond of the lack of a bezel on the front. I liked using that as a grip and physical barrier to the edge of the pages to make sure I don't change them accidentally. This one seems a bit more flimsy (you can twist it more easily), and my hands want to ""poke"" or ""pull"" on the edge to fidget while I read. This wasn't an option on the older model and probably won't be good for the Paperwhite, so I fight it.

Battery life seems OK. I haven't tried out the bluetooth as the books I've been reading don't have the Audible switching. It's a feature I really wanted, though.

Being used to the old operating system, I'm still getting used to where to find setting and how to quickly change things like brightness and font size. It's annoying, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it with use."
Jody C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a LOT of tablet products and most of them are outfitted with Kindle Reader BUT this version does what it does very well and does something none of my other tablets do. It is readable in almost any light, the battery lasts forever (well, at least 10 days in my experience), is easy on the hand and the eye. It does e-books very well, but equally important . . . wait for it. . . it doesn't pretend or try to do everything else. I don't have email, web-browsing, solitaire, productivity products, etc. etc. When I pick this thing up, the point, my dear reader, is to READ--not ""multi-task"". It gives me just enough ""extra-tasking"" [my phrase for ""just what is needed""] (dictionary, highlighting, connectivity to order other books, etc.) NOT distractions (no bleeping, ringing, or vibrating). This is the device for settling down at the end of a long day or gently and mindfully starting the new day, or just taking a break during a hectic day. Love it!"
Jonathan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because the glass is flush. I truly hate the unflushed design in the other kindle, and the Oasis is too expensive, even though it is really nice (but I do also own it).
However, this review is about the Paperwhite, and I love it thus far. It's light weight and thin. But I can truly say that the difference in screen size takes some adjusting from the Oasis to the Paperwhite. The light is adjustable, but will not acclimatize to room lighting, which is okay, because I always keep it at level 12 anyway. The print is fine and detailed. The reading experience is great as well, but I did notice that there is some glare on screen, which is the reason you would want a Kindle in the first place, the paper experience digitally. The glare kind of takes that away. I would suggest the Amazon invest in truly antiglare glass, or invent something that will improve this dramatically for their next kindle.
Overall, it's a great product and I Love it. I would recommend to anyone who wants to enter the Kindle world with a flush screen and lightweight design."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Paperwhite E-Reader. It was recommended by my Dr since I do read just before going to bed and was having trouble sleeping. The Paperwhite eliminates the blue light that is on cell phones and I have found this helpful falling asleep.
For me the Plus's are
No Blue Light.
Battery Life
Con's
To large to hold in your hands comfortably if you have small hands. I solved this with a cell phone ring holder to get a better grip on the Reader.
On/Off button is on the bottom of the Reader where you can accidentally hit turn it off while holding it. Or if it's in a stand turns off too.
No Rotating screen to avoid hitting the button.
Hard to get back to Library
Software update wipes out your place in your book.

I'm going to keep my E-Reader but I think Amazon could have done a much better job of design and SW features. The Kindle App I have on my cell phone is so much better."
sam cappas,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I just don’t get it. As technology advances, these devices should get better. Not so with this new Kindle Paperwhite (waterproof). I have had two earlier versions of the Kindle (I don’t know what model, about 7-10 years ago), a Voyager that I left in a hotel room, an Amazon Fire 7”, and this new Paperwhite that I sent back after 4 days. I had another Kindle just before this one that was worse, that I traded in. I have had two problems: 1) I can stand 3 feet from my router and the Kindle will say, “No WiFi signal.” That happened with this new one and the last one I sent back to trade in for this one; 2) Battery drains from full to %14-17 overnight. This is with it being in airplane mode (I read the other reviews) and the device being OFF.
Maybe there is some kind of trick to get the battery to last longer, but why should I have to figure it out? They tout it as having a battery lasting for weeks. Bull hockey. It doesn’t last overnight! The older ones had a better battery life. I am going to research and figured out which one I had before and get a used one. This one is a piece of crap. The Amazon Fire has better battery life, and it’s not that good. I may go back to the Voyager. I don’t remember having problems with that one.
OH, I called customer service also. Simone couldn’t care less about the problem. And I received a %25 discount when I traded in my old one. Kiss that goodbye. She said the system won’t apply that again to my return.
So, I was induced to upgrade by a %25 discount and $25.00 toward my trade-in. Now they won’t extend the %25 back to my next purchase when I return this one after 4 days. I feel like they should have offered the %25 to me again. I say don’t buy this new junk. The technology should be more advanced for the battery life.
On a lesser note, you don’t have as much freedom of choice to choose font size. Only 3 choices. DON’T TRADE UP!"
Matt Bailey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my favorite Amazon Device. It is compact and can be carried anywhere. 8 GB's of memory is enough for a decades worth of reading and audible books. The new waterproofing makes it almost indestructible.

The new Paperwhite's Audible capability should not be under rated. One of the quickest ways to get through a book is to combine both Kindle and Audible books in this device and go from reading to listening to reading with whispersync.

Everyone reads much faster than they can listen. The Audible part is great for continuing a book while commuting or doing something else. If I want to retain or review materials I'll look at my notes in the Kindle portion and set the Audible to play that chapter.

The waterproofing makes this ideal for either using it in the bath or on the beach. This device can work after being submerged in water for an extended period. Great insurance for the person on the go.

If we are talking just text 8 GB is about 3,000 books. That's about 6 books a week for ten years. Audible files take up a lot more space. This device is ideal for carrying your library with you.

This is ideal for someone like me who hates reading on an LED screen. The E-ink enables me to read in comfort. I can read on my kindle about as fast as with a physical book. There is no way I could do that on a tablet or computer.

Finally the battery lasts forever. I charge mine about once a week. I read about three books a week. The battery is still usually at higher than 50%. Excellent for traveling when charging things is at a premium.

The light is convenient for reading at night. It is front lit so it lights up the screen, not the room. Ideal for not waking other people.

Finally there are a lot of great deals on the Kindle. I've found great books from $2-4 on sale. This device pays for itself. Also 2 day shipping becomes 30 second shipping when you order a book.

This is one device I always have with me."
pthorn91,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Micro-USB is crazy outdated. I don't have anything that still uses those cables. My solution was to buy a wireless charging receiver. GAME CHANGER!
I set my kindle down on a $9 Anker charging pad where I drop my keys and wallet, and it's always charged and ready to go when I am. No fiddling with cables.

I've owned kindles since 2011. I always purchase the 3G option.
My last Paperwhite was amazing, absolutely loved it.
I didn't even realize this one wasn't 3G until it was in my hands and wouldn't go anywhere without wifi.
I even saw free cellular in the description.

There wasnt/isnt a toggle between wifi or wifi + free cellular on the product page.
Come to find out it's only the other model.
I'm disappointed and I think the marketing could be much clearer.
Grabbing new books and whispersync anywhere has always been core to using a Kindle for me.
I probably should have just bought the cheapest model.
I've never dropped a kindle in the bathtub in 8 years. I stepped on one killing the screen and one was sold by the MCO airport's lost and found department.
Either way, this feels like a step down from my 7th gen Paperwhite.

Grab an INFILAND case/cover and the wireless charging receiver to enjoy an updated Kindle experience."
D. Boyken,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fifth Kindle e-reader and my third Paperwhite, and this is the first time I've had complaints with the battery. I've had it about two weeks and have had to charge it twice (not counting topping it up on its first day). It's not unusual for the initial setup to eat up some charge, so I wasn't concerned with the drain the first day or so, but ... I'd rank its battery somewhere better than my Fire tablet, but ... I charged it two nights ago and it's down to 85% already. At this rate, I'll be charging it every week, not every three weeks like I did on my previous Paperwhite.

This isn't a deal-breaker, as reading devices go, but it's such a drastic change from the last two, I wonder what on earth was changed!

Other than that? It's still a Paperwhite. I love the screen, love the light, love reading on it. I haven't downloaded any audiobooks yet (none of my headphones are bluetooth compatible), but appreciate that that is now an option. I'm just going to miss the freedom from the charging cable for trips."
Billard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife wanted a waterproof Kindle. We first got her a Kobo H20, which she liked well enough, but a short drop of a couple feet ended its life. After that, I'd have to be nuts to get her another expensive e-reader, right?

Well, I was nuts and got her an Oasis. And it was great: page-turning buttons, bigger screen, and yes, waterproof. But she hated it ... for good reason. It weighed significantly more. It was slippery. It's battery life was atrocious, compared to other e-readers. (Still beats a tablet, I suppose.) So, when this came out, she wanted one. And she got it.

How does it compare to our old Kindle basics, Paperwhites, Kindle Keyboard 3G, Kindle DX, Oasis II, and Kobo H20? (Yes, we have had a lot of e-readers.) Well, compared to the Oasis, it is better in most ways: lighter, better battery, and it isn't slippery. The only two things the Oasis has over this are page turn buttons and a slightly bigger screen. Personally, I'd go for the Paperwhite: it's cheaper, lighter, and the trade-offs are worth it. Plus it has a more durable screen and is pocketable. But I'll always miss the page-turn buttons. I held on to my old Kindle Keyboard for years just for the buttons. I'm happy to have my wife's old Oasis for the same reason. But I wouldn't pay the extra personally just for that one feature."
robert cheung,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I read a lot, together with the fact that I'm somewhat forgetful, lends to the fact that I've owned almost every kindle to come out. This is by far the worst of them. It seems to be following a trend with the kindle product line in the last three years. The voyage was incredibly good. First round of the oasis, pretty good. Second Oasis was definitely a regression being so slippery and unwieldy. I thought this, being the newest, would reflect all the lessons they've learned about making effective e-readers over the course of their history. This was totally wrong.

1. The power button, as every one has mentioned is positioned terribly and is very sensitive. It turns off when I'm reading it, and turns on when I put it into my bag. To add salt to the wound, you cannot even rest it upright against something if you want to read while doing something else with your hands (e.g. have a meal), since it will hold down the power button.
2. The battery life is terrible, and has only gotten worse despite being only a few months old. This week I've charged it fully four times, after reading about 4 hours a day. Somehow charged it to 50% this afternoon, read a couple of hours, brought it home, and it had died.
3. The touchscreen seems much worse than my previous kindles, and I find myself mis-highlighting all the time, and needing to try footnote links many times before it jumps to the footnote rather than page turning.
4. This is probably pervasive to all kindles now, but the new home screen riddled with suggestions and my 'reading list' is gimmicky / patronizing / distracting / not useful. Just land me in the library, please."
Grey Parrot,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Edited to add: Waiting for a refurbished replacement unit because this clunker died just three days before the warranty expired. My first generation Kindle bought in 2010 still works. Bought this paperweight on October 18, 2018. Dropped dead November 9, 2019. Such quality!

I like the sharp, bright screen. It’s lighter. Has the same annoying arrangement as my iPhone Kindle app. It’s irritating to tap and get something you’re not looking for. Have had no trouble retrieving previously purchased books.
Big negatives for me is the device must not shut off entirely when you shut off the screen. There’s no other explanation than worse battery life than my dear old circa 2010 model. Same deal on reading a few pages on my phone during the day, hitting Sync Kindle on this device and not getting to the last page read. Works fine on a second generation model, why not this? I can’t find a setting to fix this.
It’s not awful and I’m not sorry I bought it; but this is nothing to get excited about. Disappointed.

November, 2019. This inferior product died. They are sending me a “refurbished” product because this piece of junk failed four days before the warranty expired. I’d probably be better off trading this one in, but too late. P.s. my ten year-old Kindle still works. What happened to product quality, Jeff?"
Linda K. Buckley,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Kindle Paperwhite. The older one stopped letting me charge it, and I thought a few upgrades were in order because I read more on the Kindle than anything else. I bought the one with the mega 32 GB because the associate at the Amazon store said this one would let me enjoy audio books. I like to do jigsaw puzzles, so how perfect to have a new use for the Kindle--be read to while playing puzzles at the same time--sounds perfect to me! Sure, I'll try! What a hassle, though to pair with a Bluetooth device. I can't believe how long it's taking me. Oh, and there are a zillion books out there in audio, but the Kindle only likes its own format, which is on audible.com, which costs about $15/month. No thanks to that. I'd like to borrow audio books from my public library in the same way I get other books to read, but no can do. I spent two hours chatting with customer service last weekend to figure out what I can do to get a no-fee audio book or to even buy one once in awhile without joining audible.com. It's not easy. But of course to listen to an audio book I need headphones, earbuds, or a speaker connected. This is a scream, a plea on bended knee to Amazon: OMG you guys need to get your act together! Add a freaking speaker to the Kindle! How about an audio jack? How about some color on the pages for a few pictures now and then (I love biographies, and there's always photos in those books.) along with some decent resolution (There were a few pictures in one book that landed on my older Kindle, but the resolution was too poor to enjoy.)? The Kindle should be so much easier to use. I would happily add a dongle to plug in my wired headphones to, but guess what? I can't even find one on amazon.com! I asked the person who sold me this Kindle at the Amazon store, and they don't sell Kindle dongles at the store, either! I went to Best Buy, and they don't have them! It's a good thing I love to read text, but I don't need so much memory for my small library. I do want to get into audio books, though. Very frustrating experience. I'd give lesser ratings, but the truth is when given a choice, a choose the Kindle to read from. Oh, and the bit about it being waterproof, well, the $40 case I bought for it (of course the case I had with the older Kindle doesn't fit the new one since the standard size has changed) is not waterproof, so watch out for that, too. I hope someone from Kindle reads this!!!!"
nrthwdswmn,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to this because of the extra space and the waterproof feature. I got what I wanted out of that. But, I am not a fan of the yellow tinted screens. I read a lot. An average of 6 hrs. A day. I want something that is really comfortable for my eyes. I truly wish for the people who like this yellowed tint, that they also made a choice option of the bright white screen of old. I have problems reading on this one. Also, I couldn't believe the amount of fingerprints. I suppose this comes from no plastic bezel around the screen. Like some other reviewers I also don't feel like the response time is up to par with previous versions and I don't like waiting for my pages to turn. It will serve its purpose for me, but it could have been so much better."
Sarah Bos,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: no glare, backlight, and it does look like paper

Cons: slow (loading and page turns), has a tendency to not flip and then flip two pages when tried again (very annoying), no page turn buttons, which I was expecting

Over all this isnt a bad device, but I was expecting better for the price. I have not tested the waterproof ability yet."
Greta Gustafsson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a Kindle fire user for years and have been a big fan. But I realized i really just use it for reading and thought I'd try the paperwhite since it's lighter and made for that. The first problem is the light, it is so dark and hard to read, no matter what settings I used. And speaking of settings, they are really hard to find, thanks for hiding them under 'accessibility', really? that's just dumb. Also, forget about the internet, it is so slow it feels like the world's first computer. I use the kindle for library books as well and getting online to anything other than an Amazon site is pointless. The other issue is the fabric cover - why make one that doesn't have a notch in the back so you can actually hold the thing? It's slim and light, but impossible to hold with one hand, which negates the whole point. Unbelievably frustrating, do not waste your time."
C.A. Tetley,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My biggest complaint about the original paperwhite was that it wasn’t waterproof, and got crumbs stuck along the screen edges. This model had a flush screen, that’s waterproof which is a great new feature. The downside is they’ve redesigned the default home screen, so you don’t default to your book collections, which is a pain in the bum, but not a huge deal. The battery however does not seem to hold a charge as long as my old one. I used to charge once a month, reading daily. Now I’m charging ever other to every week, which is a bit of a disappointment. Still the only way I can read in the car, still has adjustable back lighting, good text contrast, and adjustable font, so I’d still consider it the best eReader brand I’ve ever used, and highly recommend it for the heavy reader."
Jon Shemitz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, this would be better labeled ""water resistant"" - there's a standard USB charging hole, and a mechanical button, and we are instructed to dry the device carefully and immediately if it should get submerged. Still, this is enough to let it be used in a bath or by a poolside, so it's still pretty nice.

This is my 3rd Kindle. It remains outdoor legible, but the backlight lets it be read in the dark or gloom. It's faster than my old DX, and the photos in periodicals look a lot better. (This might be the backlight at work.)

The touch screen means there are no more mechanical buttons for navigation, which is nice, BUT the touch screen is not very sensitive (I'm always tapping it forward, and nothing happens) AND the 'back button area' on the left is just too narrow (it seems I go forward probably three quarters of the time that I try to go back). It would be very nice if these were settings-adjustable: I'd happily trade a little battery life for better touch sensitivity if that is possible."
Maria,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this kindle because I wanted one I could take into the bathtub with me to do my readings for school. It appears to function as well as my kindle voyage, though I wish this one had physical buttons for page flipping. I also noticed that the keyboard is finicky and even when I'm touching the correct letter, sometimes another letter gets typed instead. However, these are not big enough gripes to dock any stars - the kindle does exactly what I wanted and needed it to do, and that's being my bathtub buddy."
NCmomof4,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I spent DAYS reading reviews and weighing my options about this tablet, and I never saw a review like this so I hope I can help someone else make a decision. This Kindle is ok. It's very small -- my cell phone isn't much bigger, and I don't own a huge cell phone. It's black and white, not a drop of color, which shocked me for some reason. There is NO BRICK to charge it, only a cord in the package, which means you have to buy a separate accessory (that's $20) just to be able to use it! I found that sad and ridiculous. The charge most certainly does not last weeks. I charge mine on Sundays and it does last all week when I read a few minutes at work each day, and some at night, but not weeks. There is NO WAY to access the app store which means if you use your local library Overdrive like I do, you have to download that on another device, then find your books, and have them sent to the kindle, which is a gigantic pain in the booty. I got 3 months free from kindle unlimited, but I have yet to find a single book that I wanted to read on it, it's very limited on selections. It's not super user friendly ...I had to google how to even get out of a book once I was reading it. I have difficulty navigating it and usually once I figure something out, I've tried for so long to get there, I can't remember how to do it for next time.
There are some positives. It will hold thousands of books. I love that it's waterproof. I did buy the no ads version so I have nothing cluttering up the front. It will get pretty large in font -- a favorite thing to do, so I can make the words bigger and read in bed without my glasses. There are many, many accessories to personalize it. I picked an adorable cover for it, and I love that there were so many options. It came quickly and was well packaged. The light is just bright enough to see in the dark, but not so bright it hurts your eyes. There really is no glare, I can read in full sunlight with no issues. If I jump through enough hoops, I CAN access overdrive books, and read them easily on my tablet. They transfer quickly. There are millions of titles to buy, if you would like to do that.
Overall, I would not recommend this ereader. I will take some of the responsibility because I had only owned tablets to read from before, never a basic e-reader, but still overall it's just not worth it. I paid more for this than the Amazon Fire 10 inch tablet that I was comparing it to and the only thing that was positive for this product over it was, it's waterproof and had more space. It's seriously annoying to have to go through SO MANY steps just to pick out a book from the library and get it to my Kindle, and I still can't believe they didn't even send a charging brick so you could make this product work. Also, the lack of charging brick is NOT made clear in the product description, I checked so many times. If you want something super basic to read on, and you plan to buy the books, or you just HAVE to have it waterproof, then this might be ok for you. Happy reading either way!"
whirledpieces,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an older Nook with e-Ink display and have always really enjoyed the premise, but wanted something more modern. When I saw that this was waterproof, I was hooked. It reads just like a paper book, the light feature is gentle and perfect for night reading, the battery lasts for weeks, I'm not worried about water damage at the beach or pool. 100% would recommend, if you're an avid reader like myself."
J. P.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The physical design is perfect. Light and comfortable to use,however, at the end of every single document, the device gets stuck on the rating screen, and I have to restart the device. Plus, for a device that is only displaying txt in black and white, it is pretty sluggish when clicking through options. Very disappointed and going back to my nook tablet.

Update: 6/7/19
So after my Nook passed away, I decided to give this another shot, and have bumped the review up a star because, so far, no more stuck books.

I've read about 8 books with this thing so far, and I do like the physical aspects of it. Lightweight, easy on the eyes, nice dark theme for night use.

I've also kind of gotten used to the slight sluggishness, and the weird page refresh, other reviewers are right, eventually you just stop noticing it.

However, the thing that keeps this review at a 3 rather than higher is the terrible system interface. There's a settings button at the top of the quick menu with a few tweaks like brightness, but if you want to turn off the wifi, you have to go to the full system settings. What's needed is a single, responsive and logical interface. By the way, another thing that would be nice, is a way to turn off the wifi. I just use the Airplane mode, is that what I'm supposed to do?

I bought this thing to read books. I can read books on it, so I'm happy enough that I won't return this one, but I am optimistic that someday there will be a system update that fixes some of these issues."
Patrick Mrowczynski,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Picked this up for a Christmas / Birthday gift for the wife. The Christmas part was the Kindle and the birthday was the cover (pt 2).

It's very light weight. For those of us who grew up with reading PDF's on tablets (cough, apple, cough), it's so much lighter. The eye strain is nearly non-existent as you can read it in normal light with the backlight off, or in the dark with it on and low. The battery says it'll last for weeks ... in standby. But she'll get a good day out of it before having to charge it up (don't ask me, I don't know what she does with it).

Most importantly, it's waterproof! This is the huge selling feature for me (for her, happy wife, happy life) as she can get to use it in the hot tub or keep it where it may be wet / moist / foggy / steamy without damage. She ran into problems with finding a convertor to make the ""library"" of books she has in different formats work - but she was very happy with the conversion and readability.

Great for flying, great for hot tub, and great for a happy wife ... hence happy life.

Photo? Her using it in the hot tub? Nay...."
Laurie Berger,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this in February and it worked fine until June. It wouldn't turn on so I followed web advice and held the button for a looooonggg time until it hiccuped and came back. Unfortunately, the battery only lasts for about 7 hours now. I'm disabled and I read a lot so I'm constantly recharging it. Can't afford a new one at this point and I'm extremely disappointed with this iteration of Kindle."
Celeste M.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My All-new Kindle Paperwhite background is not as bright white as my 2016 paperwhite, actually not even white, more like an old paperback. A major difference, is this normal or do I have a defective product? Nothing wrong with my original Paperwhite, I just wanted more GB. I don't read near water and won't use the audible, so just wondering about the difference in lighting."
Sunny Side Up,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can i say...amazon e-readers are the best. Comparing to my older paperwhite reader the following are much better. There may be things i haven’t figured out as of yet.

Pros:
1. Screen is so much clearer and brighter. When the light is dimmed its easier to read the words as well. With the older paperwhite if i took the light down to far it was hard to read because the darker background would blend into the words.
2. Weight difference. Older paperwhite heavier, not by that much but enough that i can keep a case on the new one and not hurt my wrists. I know that probably sounds pretty wimpy...but it is a problem for me having arthritis.
3. Wasn’t sure about the bluetooth if i would even use it, but i have listened to a couple of books, and the sound is clear.
I didn’t run into any connection problems either.
4. Haven’t yet experimanted with the water proof so I can’t fairly say anything in regards to that. It is one of the reasons I purchased this reader. More to follow on this.
5. The setting are just a swipe away. Swipe down and the menu is available. No jumping through hoops to reach your destination.
6. You can now set a book to show the page you are on and the time of day at the top of the book in progress. (Love that option)

Cons;
1. There is no way to listen to your own audiobooks it only works with audible or a book from Amazon that includes free audio.
2. There is no way to add music. I envisioned this reader to be able to lay by the pool, (water proof) listen to a book and if i tired of that switch to music. So BOO HOO thats a huge con for me.
3. Device is NOT compatible with the libby app. This is another biggie for me. It would be nice to have the option of listening to a book on ANY of my kindle devices. So i can pick up where i left off on all of them.
I did contact audible and there is no way to use the libby app. I’m hoping this can somehow be a software up date or something. PLEASE...don't make me need another kindle in a few months.

I am keeping this reader even though I have cons that really bother me because the screen is so much easier in my eyes and less weight easier on my wrists."
jeremyeb14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had a little issue figuring out how to redeem the 6 months of kindle unlimited that came with it, but found the redemption email after a representative called me from amazon.
The email to redeem it was found in my spam box for my email and I profusely appologize for my former 1 star review because after chatting with amazon representatives I thought there was no way to get the 6 months of kindle unlimited.
It was corrected quickly and I appologize for not checking spam earlier as all other emails from amazon came through my main inbox fine.

The product works great and customer support was very good, thanks amazon"
Joan from Sloan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a huge improvement over my old kindle for one main reason: the light. I’ve included a photo of both kindles sitting on my kitchen table in the daytime. There was no way I could read the old kindle without adding an overhead light. I don’t want to read in bed; I just want to sit in the living room recliner and read without an overhead light.

Aside from that wonderful light, I don’t find that many differences between old and new kindles. The new one is a touch screen, which takes a little getting used to. I don’t understand the complaints about the light. My friend has an older Paperwhite and I can see little lightbulbs at the bottom of the page on his if I tilt it just right. Mine looks as smooth as the screen on my iPad. OK, maybe if I tilt it reeeeally hard, I can see five little light spots on the bottom, but no little lightbulbs. The on button is at the bottom. Same place as my old kindle. The screen has a slight sheen to it, same as my old kindle. I ordered a new leather cover, but my old cover, which held the kindle in place with elastic bands, fits the new kindle too. Both kindles have “special offers,” which means that when the kindle is off a screensaver with an ad for a book comes on. Really, not worth getting excited about.

I very seldom buy books. I get my books from the public library through the Overdrive app or through Kindle Unlimited or Prime. For that reason, I find the “your reading lists” category, which apparently just gives suggestions as to my next purchase, to be useless. It’s the only feature of the new Paperwhite I could do without. I took care to add the “parental control” so I couldn’t accidentally buy something without meaning to while browsing.

I took off one star for battery life because I know that, with the light, it will be impossible to match the old kindle’s battery life.

The new Paperwhite is totally worth buying. Since your entire library is up in Amazon’s cloud vault somewhere, you really don’t need more than the 8 gb storage on the pad itself. And you can get it in BLUE!!! What more reasons do you need?"
Grammy B,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had several Kindle devices over the past decade. I purchased this Kindle as part of a trade-in deal during Amazon Prime Day 2019, and it is not nearly as good as the old one I traded in (I think it was 7th or 8th generation). I regret doing so. In fact, it's downright unsatisfactory.

Soon after purchase it began to shut itself down while I was reading it, and removing the downloaded books from the device with a notice that the books were removed and no longer available. Customer service was helpful in getting me to the stage where I could get the books back. I had to do a factory reset in order to get them back (deregister, then reregister, put in Amazon settings and wifi passwords.)

Unfortunately the problem kept happening. The screen began alternating between a blank screen and the Kindle page with the silhouette of the boy reading under a tree. Each time I would have to deregister then reregister the device. I returned the ebook and Amazon sent me a new one.

The new one began doing the same thing. I began to see a ""quality control issue"", so I contacted Amazon again. They told me that they could not replace it again, but it was still under warranty, so I should send it in for repair. If it could not be repaired, they would replace it again.

In a short time it was returned to me with a note that it had been repaired satisfactorily and had received a software update.

Well, as you may have surmised, it has happened again. It no longer removes the e-books from the device, but it shuts down unexpectedly and has to go through the restart process again. When the book I'm reading comes back up, it's frequently at the page at which I started reading earlier in the day so I have to swipe through until I can find the current page. I have not contacted customer service again, but at this point I doubt they would do anything again. I have borrowed my husband's older Kindle and it works perfectly, as had my older one. I must say I do love Kindle e-readers, just not the generation I recently purchased. Unfortunately, they're lemons.

So, if you want a new Kindle device, my advice is to wait for a new generation so the bugs can be worked out."
sparrow,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The latest paperwhite is very light. It has the perfect feel in my hand, weight, size, dimension, everything. I also really like the blue color backing. The download speed is at least 3 or 4 times faster than my previous paperwhite. Love it! The one thing that has not improved, however, is the touch screen. Swipe and scroll is not smooth - choppy and klunky, but that has always been the case with the paperwhite.

One thing that has gotten worse is the bookmark feature and hit-spot detection. Previous version the bookmark just appears when touched then you can toggle it on or off. Current version you have to hit a little plus (+) sign and the dropdown below it is just confusing and annoying. Current version also seem to not detect hit-spot very well. Highlighting is problematic if you want adjust the highlighted text using the end handles; most time it is just easier to delete the highlight and try again. There are also other little oddities that pop up unexpectedly when trying to search. The [Clear previous search] button does not always respond when touched.

Speaking of the search feature, really please get rid of the ""Search Everywhere"" option. Almost 100% of the time I am looking for something within the book I am currently reading. The ""Search Everywhere"" is highly undesirable and frustrating. To date, I have yet to find something in the book and have had to resort to scanning through notes, bookmarks and table of contents to find something. Please, please bring back the search functionality of my previous paperwhite. It was simpler, easy to use and actually works!"
James Joshua Whitaker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle Paperwhite review
I read many reviews and did quite a bit of research in selecting a Paperwhite. I purchased one and want to be over the moon with it but I'm not. I have found that it is much easier on the eyes than my pixel phone or my Samsung tablet. Especially at night. I also like that it only has a platform for books and audiobooks (with Bluetooth speaker or headphones.)
I was expecting the Kindle Paperwhite to be smoother in it's transitions. To me it feels looks like the transitions on the Home page are ""jerky"" and ""slow"" when scrolling. Almost as if the system has to replace one screen with another but can't do it fast enough to make a smooth scrolling transition. For example on a tablet, scrolling is smooth. The pictures and words move and stop in smooth transition when scrolling. Not so with the Paperwhite. It may be that I need to get used to this new format to me. Or it may be that the system needs to be more like the app for Android or iOS so there are no surprise false expectations. I really want to love this but I don't.

Three week update.
The above is true. However, I have gotten use to the quarks and don't mind them at all now. I have found that reading with the Kindle Paperwhite is awesome. It's the perfect size for reading and taking with you. There is no eye strain while reading. I have only charged it three times and have been reading for an hour to an hour and a half at a time. Well worth the money. Three stars to five stars."
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"** UPDATED REVIEW**
WHOEVER THOUGHT TO PUT THE POWER BUTTON ON THE BOTTOM OF THE KINDLE SHOULD BE FIRED. When I put it on a stand to read, it shuts off. When I lean it on me to read, it shuts off. The only way to ""fix"" the problem is to read it in landscape mode...

This is my first experience with a kindle. I had high expectations due to the price.
Pros:
1. Very customizable, can change language, font, font size, back light, ect.
2. Pretty glare free, yet of course, screen is glass, so some glare was expected.
3. Very compact and light.

Cons:
1. Screen smudges very easily. Which is bad as there are no page turning buttons, so you HAVE to touch the screen to turn page.
2. Smudgy screen affects how clear the text is, which is very clear in areas not smudged.
3. Slow to start after asleep, I'm not sure what other versions were like compared to this.
4 & 5(I'll combine these as they are related) I feel as it needs a case, and case selection is very limited. I wanted to test how it would be without a case, but as soon as I got it I had to get one. I didn't feel comfortable putting it in my purse since it smudges easily I figured it would scratch easy too. (Maybe instead of a whole case, a screen protector could be a good substitute?)"
Joshua Knarr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a barnes and noble simple touch, and a first generation kindle reader. B&N really stopped supporting the first gen simple touches, and the kindle I have is one of the ones with a weird shadow on the bottom of the screen which is visible when reading in the dark. The kindle always looked nicer, for whatever reason, but the simple touch was nicer to hold and having clicky buttons meant I bounced between the two fairly regularly, stealing the nook from my kids when I wanted to go to B&N and let them hang out in the kids section.

So now on to the review: Upgrading from the first generation of each device to this is a definite improvement. The display is miles better and can display a full page of tiny text when reading books with illustrations which require it instead of tiling those illustrations. Technical manuals and text books are vastly improved as a result. I also like the screen not being recessed anymore, I don't feel like I'm looking into something so much as reading an actual book. The back light seems very even, and can be dimmed as not to disturb others. Since the screen is no longer recessed, this lets me read holding the screen so the light won't disturb others without occluding the page.

The store still goes stupid sometimes and books I have purchased on the computer aren't automatically loaded or displayed. The home page still needs some shortcut or something to immediately jump back into the book I've last read. The UI seems largely the same between the first gen one and this one.

Page blanking still is a thing, with a brief, noticeable but short blacking of the screen on a page turn. Theres a few options to play with this but they don't seem to make much of a difference to the user experience because there's simply no way to disable it entirely. I suppose this is a result of the eink display.

The touching-things portion is good, although it seems that a ""tap"" anywhere implies ""next page"" rather than dividing the screen up into logical quadrants. Or maybe I'm not used to it. Swiping seems to be the default for ""last page"". Page highlights work well, the highlighting is intuitive. Note-taking is also good. Footnotes are well done although I would appreciate an MLA citation rather than simply ""title and publishing date"" but that's probably a result of who actually authored the footnotes. Touching a footnote is sometimes wonky and will turn the page instead which is sometimes aggravating. There has to be a way to calibrate the display for that?

The keyboard is sufficient, although the web browser is dreadful. Don't even try to use it. Wikipedia is good but I wish it downloaded the references ahead of time rather than depending on an active internet connection. Translation, when it's available, is typically accurate enough for every day reading but reading legal documents or poetry in a foreign language becomes a chore. I speak both French and German and while I couldn't knock the machine translation (when available) I would be hard pressed to trust it's accuracy in a greater scope than individual words.

Audible: Why is this a seperate thing? I would appreciate the e-reader doing the voice itself, even if it was weird and robotic. The bluetooth has connected to everything I've tried it with so it's not a huge problem.

No regrets buying it, the Kindle Unlimited trial is great and will offset the cost a bit, and the screen is amazing compared to previous e-readers in the house. Also it's pretty easy to snag those $1 credits for books from various places, which makes the already cheap books pretty close to free for the eagle eyed shopper.

EDIT: I don't remember fingerprints being a problem on the last one but on the new paperwhite it's a thing. If the screen gets ""smeared"" text, it's not a screen defect, it's just oily fingerprints. I first thought my screen developed a weird spot, but then I cleaned it with a gentle, very diluted soap and water and it's like new again."
Cristina Kiefer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my highly awaited new Kindle Paperwhite Waterproof ereader yesterday. I have a 2015 kindle fire that I treat as a glorified ereader, but was having issues with the glare. I was excited to get this device. I also have a nook glowlight waterproof reader which I love, but found it a pita to download any of my previous nook content. This new kindle offered the best of both worlds. Low an behold all my kindle content was easily accessible on this new device once I registered it. It arrived with a 52% charge. When I tried to charge it fully using the charging cord that came in the package, it wouldn't go in the port fully and would not charge! Total disappointment! A call to Amazon CS suggested I use another charger! Really...well, the kindle fire charger worked like a charm. Still disappointed in Amazon's CS response, though."
KK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I grew up an avid reader and bought a first or second generation Nook many years ago when eReaders were new (and clunky). I ended up using it once or twice and eventually gave it away for free years later, resigning myself to being a ""physical book type of person"". Unfortunately, the free time to browse and linger in the library that I had growing up is now scarce. I turned to purchasing my hard copy books online. Choosing which physical book to spend money on and devote bookshelf space to resulted in a kind of decision paralysis that led to not jumping on many titles that looked interesting. Also, I will not lie to you - somewhere in the last decade I transformed into a screen addict that spends too much time on her cell phone. I clicked around the internet and read lots of things online: well-written news and columns along with a more-than-healthy share of poorly written news articles, list mills, Facebook posts, click bait...you get the idea. This kind of screen conditioning has resulted in me being more likely to pick up my little screen when it comes time to choose between it and the book it's sitting on top of on my nightstand.
I decided to revisit eReaders and see what had changed. This new Kindle Paperwhite has pretty much everything that was lacking in that first Nook - super lightweight, no buttons to accidentally press, built in illumination, high resolution, fast page refreshes, seamless store integration, AND waterproof. The amount of digital content and the way it is available through Amazon to nearly instantly appear on the Kindle has opened a new world of reading to me. I signed up for a few newsletters (Goodreads and BookBub) that deliver recommendations and discounts to my inbox, and I can send a free sample to my Kindle within seconds and read at my leisure before deciding whether to purchase the full thing. My whole reading and want-to-read library fits in the little side pocket of my purse. As a hybrid with the positives of easy-to-read paper and my cell phone, where the world is accessible at my fingertips and is always bright enough to read, I find it infinitely easier to pick up (and just as hard to put down when it's time to go to sleep!) I find myself reading so much less internet garbage now, and way more thoughtfully put-together, researched, and absorbing titles that are easy to start reading as that clickbait headline. If you too are a phone addict that misses the days of reading books, but finds the real thing hard to pick up during that nightly competition - this device and platform can trick your brain back into reading the good stuff all the time instead."
Jacki,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My Kindle Paperwhite was stolen, and I missed it desperately, especially for bedtime reading, but I really resented having to pay so much more for the upgraded version than I had for the last one. Is it lighter weight? Definitely, but I never found the last one too heavy. Is it waterproof? Don't know -- I never take it to the beach or the bath. I can see why that might be an appealing feature for some people. Longer battery life? Don't know -- I haven't owned it last enough to say. It seems to be a bit harder to return to a previous page using the touch screen. I've found myself a couple of pages ahead instead a few times. Font and light adjustments work as well as they did in the previous version -- my favorite feature."
Ankit Garg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally bought the Oasis 2 after I accidentally threw my 8 year old Kindle Touch and broke the power button. It came at a huge premium cost, but I figured I earned it after keeping my old Kindle for so long. It turned out to be an extremely awkward device to hold, and the battery drained constantly with minimal use.

Luckily, the new Kindle Paperwhite 4 was announced within 30 days of my purchase, so I returned the Oasis 2. The Paperwhite 4 is pretty much the Oasis 2 minus the larger screen (which was never a plus for me since the device no longer fit into large pockets) and the adaptive brightness (which is a really unneeded feature and likely drains the battery faster).

A lot of people keep saying their battery life is terrible. I received my Kindle Paperwhite on 11/7/18. I charged it once to 100%, and it is now 11/13/18 and my battery is at 84%. WiFi is on. Admittedly, I've used it minimally (perhaps 5 hours total) since I've been working. However, the passive battery drain some folks are reporting has not been my experience. Either there are some defective units out there or their Kindles are indexing their books.

I'm very happy with my purchase, though the price is a bit steep. However, the 25% off for device trade-in was quite nice since my Kindle was pretty old. I'm sure I'll have this device for close to a decade before I buy another one."
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The All-new Kindle Paperwhite - Now Waterproof has outdated software. It is unable to list your collections in alphabetical order. It will not allow you to custom sort your books within collections. And yet, the Kindle app for android phone does this perfectly. The Kindle Paperwhite software seems better suited for those who do not own e-books but instead subscribe to Kindle Unlimited. It will easily keep track of the 10 books you have checked out and show you the books who have on your reading list to check out next.

The actual touchscreen lags so much in response time as to seem non-responsive. The device is not worth paying for if you can use your phone as an e-reader."
Sean Dibble,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this newest Paperwhite because my 2012 model finally quit after 6.5 years. After reading mixed reviews about the newest version and with my old one as the standard, I was a little skeptical about this one. Not to worry!! After a little confusion about when I would get my new Paperwhite (it came on time) and some time setting it up and downloading a couple hundred books, I am as happy as before. This Paperwhite (8 Gb storage and no ads) is more adjustable and more comfortable than the 2012 version and it reads in daylight at least as well. Don't know about the review that said no anti glare, no readability in daylight, etc. but I can verify this Paperwhite is still excellent. I don't know about features like audible, etc. that I will never use, but this reader is the best!"
Lane,5.0 out of 5 stars,Battery lasts way longer on airplane mode. Love that I can bring this in the bath.
Katybeth Jensen-Ruscitti,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My 6th Kindle just died after two years. None of them have lasted more than 3. It is a battery issue.
Before buying another one, I contacted Amazon through chat--which is just a person with a script. Customer says this--you say this. I asked how long the average Kindle should last. After being directed through troubleshooting (which I already had tried), I was told the life span would vary based on the usage and how I took care of the Kindle. Below are the instructions I was given for improving a Kindles lifespan.

""You need to low the brightness and turn off WiFi when not in use, and while charging, you need to low the brightness and see that device is in no activity and then charge it by leaving it Idle. These are the precautions you can take for device long life.""

(side note: Amazon--you need to hire a better scriptwriter) Ok, so now you know. I find all of this somewhat annoying, but I do like the size and convenience of the Kindle. However, these instructions should be included with the Kindle (if they are I missed them), and I may look at other options with a longer lifespan."
Michael L. Talbott,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the third Kindle I have purchased. This new Kindle pretty much operates the same as the last Kindle version I have, so there was really no new learning curve. The light is brighter and the words are more crisp on the screen. The touch screen works exactly like my previous Kindle. The battery life is about the same, if not a little better, as long as you leave your Kindle in airplane mode while reading and only turn it off while purchasing materials for your Kindle.

I paid a little more this Kindle because I didn't want all the advertisement flooding my screen. I also jumped up 32 GB since my last Kindle was slowing down with so many books in it. It was probably over kill but I want to make sure I have plenty of storage for the next few years.

I am very pleased with the new 10th generation Kindle."
lgndavison,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded because I bought into the marketing language of waterproof and the slightly smaller and lighter build. Once I received the new Kindle I did notice that it actually felt lighter, slightly smaller, and a little more portable. I liked the slimmer profile and trimmed bezels. After using it for a day though, I found some annoyances that made me retreat back to my previous version. With this new update, you lose the ""paper"" feel of the previous screen. This screen (which covers the entire front of the device) is smooth and slick to the touch, leaving fingerprints everywhere. It also produces a significant amount of more glare (still way less than an iPad) than the previous version. My device had some residual glue from manufacturing on the right front of the device around the edges. Another annoying feature was the ""waking up"" from being locked that took an extra few seconds to get into reading. I'm aware you can turn off this feature, but doing so quickly drains battery life, which already occurred at a higher rate than the previous version. Lastly, while the backlight is brighter than the previous generation, that also means it doesn't dim as low. I do a lot of reading at night in bed, and I found the lowest brightness setting to be several levels brighter than the lowest setting on the older model. For now, I'm sticking with last model's paperwhite and will just continue taking extra care around the pool."
aryxus,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had a paperwhite for four years, but it plotzed out on me and nobody at Amazon could help, so I figured I’d upgrade.

Though upgrade isn’t really the word. The cost has gone up (I paid $80 4 years ago), and none of the features I got for that price increase are useful. If I wanted audiobooks I’d just use my iPhone, so Bluetooth is unnecessary. Waterproof is nice, but I don’t use mine in the bath. Not sure what other new features there are, because I just want to read!

I do know the interface has gone backward. For some reason, it’s slower. When I hit the button, it now says “Waiting ...” for long enough to be irritating. Also, while waiting, the backlight is turned way up. So now when I’m in bed I have to hide it under the covers for a bit when turning it on. What’s up with that? My 4-year-old kindle didn’t do that!

And they still haven’t moved the button, so I still can’t lean my kindle on the table against a stand, because it shuts the damn thing off. Who puts the power switch on the bottom of a device?!

So, yes, the Kindle changed my reading habits. But this particular Kindle kinda sucks."
C. Coppinger,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 7th Kindle, 3rd Paperwhite. While I am a confirmed Kindle user, this unit has several significant drawbacks IMHO.
1. The most annoying feature is the location of the power button. I read this in reviews by others, but didn't think it would be a problem. It is for me, The natural position for my hand ( I hold it one-handed) is such that I have repeatedly turn it off inadvertently while reading. The first time it happened I didn't realize what I had done to precipitate the shutdown; as the button is small, When I realized what had happened I thought ""Huh, gotta be careful about that."" And yet I do it regularly. Never had this problem with my older unit as the power button was high on the back of the unit.
2. I suppose I should have known this would be the case; but because I got the water-proof version this unit is noticeably heavier in the hand than my previous (non-waterproof) unit. Not a deal breaker, but I preferred the feather light previous edition. The irony here is that I never read in the shower, pool or tub; if it starts to rain I'm prone to go inside anyway. I mainly got this one figuring if it was waterproof it was probably sand-proof; and I do read a lot on the beach. We'll see...

I don't dislike it enough to return it, but when (inevitably) it gets replaced I will bear these features/bugs in mind."
Brendon G.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi all,
I have had the original keyboard Kindle for years and love the product for the ability to read my documents to me. I have a reading disability and having the audio as I read helps the words stay in the right order. I was happy to see that the new Paperwhite had VoiceView so I decided to upgrade. The reading part of VoiceView works fine, but the functionality of the system, while it's in Voice View, is abysmal. In order to turn on the feature, I have to go through three menus, which is required to turn on the feature, off the feature, or just adjust either the volume/ speed of the feature. On top of that in order to navigate while the feature is on, I have to double tap every button to get into the menus. The first tap is to get it to read the menu item to me which is fine but it normally reads the item to me then returns the selection to the home icon before I can make the selection. So when I tap the second time to go into settings instead I am returned to the home page and have to start the process again. In the old version of the Kindle, I could turn the feature on and off in the quick menu and adjust volume in that same quick menu as it was running. Please put that quick access back into the system. Last but not least when you put the system in sleep mode while you are in Voiceview mode it prevents you from unlocking the screen. Instead of being able to ""slide up to unlock"" the system forces me to double tap the add and then go through the process of selecting through a bunch of menus again to get back to what I was reading. Please put that quick access to VoiceView into the system make it disabled on the lock screen.

I will say I love being able to read in the Opendyslexic font. This font is very helpful and allows me to read long before my reading disability starts to cause me problems. pair this with the reading feature this Kindle is amazing. the only reason, I am giving the two stars is because of the Voiceview navigation, fix that and this would be a five-star Item for me. I miss the 3g feature for downloading books too but in the modern age of wifi everywhere it is not that much of an issue, and the waterproof and light features make such a world of difference I will gladly live with looking for a wifi signal to download my next book on the go."
kalyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this kindle for 3 weeks now and use it about 30 minutes a day, some days for an hour or more, and have not had to charge it since the day I got it; and I still have 23% battery. I'd say that's a darn good battery life for anything.
-The screen does show fingerprints and such sometimes, but I can't say that's complaint-worthy. Just wipe it down every now and then.
+ It seems to have more than adequate space for books, as well as audible capability which is a nice touch that I'll probably never use.
+The back light is great and has many different brightness options.
-I have only accidentally powered it down because of button placement once and it literally turns back on in like 30 seconds so again, not a big deal.
+Perfect size for almost any purse, comfortable in my hand, easy to use.

Overall, great buy. I have not owned the previous versions so I can't compare or say you'll like this one better but my general opinion is I can't see how this would be a bad purchase for anyone who reads enough to consider this as an option."
Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle. I own the 'other' device from the competition for years. When you google the differences, the 'other' was allegedly 'better' until this new Kindle with the light, waterproof, etc The biggest difference (they are the same size, weight, memory, etc.) is that when you want to download books from your public library, it's one button with a Kindle! That's why I got one Also if you belong to Prime, there are offers and discounts and deals and specials/sales. If you want to shop on your Kindle, you can buy, borrow a book in one click and with the other kind, one has to go online (off the device) and separately place the order. Everything you want to do can be done from the Kindle itself. With the other brand, no discounts were ever offered on ebooks. So, if you are not sure, I recommend this version because it is simple and idiot-proof. The other kind is complicated and more steps."
Love To Read,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had Kindle's since they first came out. My old Kindle voyage was getting so I had to recharge it everyday so I thought I would try the new paper white. Have to say I am disappointed that it is not really improved other than being waterproof. They really need to work on improving the battery, they say ""weeks"" which is totally not true if you read daily. The charging cord that came with it did not fit the plug, it was too big to insert in the hole. I contacted them and they told me to buy another cord and they would refund the cost which they did. The cord took a week to be delivered. Thankfully my cord for the Voyage worked because it needed charging before using."
kimberley,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Was very excited when this came out. With the 25% off trade in plus 6 months free of kindle unlimited I jumped on this great deal. Unfortunately it is just not as great a deal as I hoped.

I started with the kindle (that had no built in light and had the keyboard bottom) loved it but it was so bulky with the cover so I have for the last few years been using the kindle phone app (which I absolutely love). I thought this kindle would be perfect to balance the phone app so I would not be draining my phone battery while I am at the gym, beach, etc. Sadly so far it does not. I can never get the kindle paperwhite to sync with my kindle phone app, I always have to manually find the last page read every time I switch devices which is extremely frustrating. Other issues I have with the new kindle paperwhite is certain times while turning a page it will skip multiple pages at a time, there is no option for black screen with white letters (which I prefer), and with the power button on the bottom whenever I prop the kindle on any flat surface it triggers the off button and turns it off.

Due to my experience so far I would not recommend spending the money on this device."
Sandra Ashworth,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: Changing my 2 star to a 4 star rating. Finally about to get in touch via chat to get a replacement. It definitely took some time to verify information, but it was worth it. The only thing on the screen was an image of the battery with an exclamation mark. I guess this is similar to the blue window of death on your laptop. Customer service was excellent and patient as we worked through all the questions. While my daughter is insistent on using the Kindle and loves it. I have found the app for my phone enjoyable and never had an issue with it. I have not used the app on my iPad, but would think text would be easier to read. This comes down to personal preference. I leave as a 3 star rating since I am rating the Kindle product and not the Kindle service.

Worked great until you can’t charge it. Can’t even return for an exchange because I can’t get a response from Amazon on return. My daughter loves to read and now that going anywhere is difficult, this was a great alternative. Not sure what to do. We’ve already tried the chat page to find solutions on the-setting and trying new chargers. Nothing.
Only thing we can do is exchange for a replacement. Hopefully, we will get help with this sometime soon so I can get her back to reading."
Kiki,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this device for my mom. We figured it would be easy for her to use. Despite the simplicity of the concept of the product, it is impossible to find support. We were excited she would be able to switch between reading the book and listening to it- no support online on how to use this feature. Upon set-up, we were forced into making her a GoodReads account- no way to bypass this. Once we set up her bluetooth headphones, we found that she needs to buy each of the audible books she wants to listen to, along with the kindle version so she can switch between the two. SUCH A WASTE. The more I try to set this device up for her, the more I realize we have to sign-up for more accounts to otherwise meaningless platforms. I've looked online for support. Amazon's recommended form of using the kindle is through the apps you can download on your phone. I found that I need to download some other application called WhisperSync to use the audio version of this device? Another platform that we need to integrate to this already infuriating device. My mom has a hard time with technology but has been trying to push herself to learn more. I am really upset that her first venture was this wasteful device. It is discouraging that such a profitable company cannot offer support or tutorials that I can direct her to. Instead, I'm pouring through endless forums trying to access features that were specifically marketed to be main features. Shameful."
Kathy M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wish it came with a small printed booklet to help people, new to Kindle, with simple instructions. Things like how to borrow a book instead of purchasing etc. I purchased the instruction book but find it annoying to look up and read instructions on the same devise I'm trying to learn & use. Love the touch screen, built in light is great for reading in bed or on night flights and the long battery life is great. I also like being able to make the print larger. It should have come with a wall plug adapter as well as the charging cable. Overall a nice way to read!"
L.G.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this Kindle (which I purchased via preorder) for exactly one week now. I hadn't gotten around to reading a book on it yet until tonight, where I found the screen will not respond to my touch. The only button on it still seems to work and it will show up as charging and on my computer when connected via the USB cable, but all functionality is lost because the touch sensor on the screen is not working."
Zelda,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ""upgraded"" to this version from a 10 year old Kindle and am very disappointed. The organization options stink, it's nearly impossible to find what I want, and the screen is half filled with Amazon's recommendations instead of the books I've purchased and want to read. Navigation is horribly unintuitive. The battery life is much shorter than they claim, even with the lighting turned to lowest setting. I wish I could get my old one back, but Amazon claims it arrived at trade in with a broken screen and not working even though it worked perfectly and screen was not broken when I sent in, wrapped very well for protection."
Nicole Del Sesto,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I mostly love this, but like others have mentioned I'm constantly turning it off by accident, which is SUPER annoying.
Accidentally lay your finger there, and it's off. That's almost a deal breaker. I'm hoping once I get a case for it, that will stop. Which brings me to another issue - finding a case which actually fits it, and has a stand. So far I tried a Moko, but it was super bulky so I returned it.

It's super annoying that every case says ""not fit paperwhite 2019"" so when you search for cases for Paperwhite 2019, guess what comes up? All of those. I wish I'd bought the bundle.

I'm not sure I understand the ""weeks"" of battery life. I mean, if I don't read at all - yes, it lasts. But I do read and thus, I don't get ""weeks"" of battery life. Seems misleading.

The positive - my last Paperwhite is 6 years old and still going. I just felt like I wanted some of the new features and wanted to treat myself. I love the lightness and all the software updates including the ""read"" books feature. The screen is fantastic. It's a great reading experience. This is my 3rd Kindle, and I can't imagine switching to another eReader.

Also, pay the extra and get ad free. You don't need to be Amazon's indentured servant for $20.00."
Steve Cavender,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall it works pretty good. I've had several Kindles. This model has pros and cons, relative to an earlier model Kindle Paperwhite.
Pros:
Overall it works well. It easily and quickly connects to the wireless internet, is quick and responsive.
The touch screen seems to work very well and the processor is more powerful than my previous Kindle Paperwhite.

Cons:
The battery life is about half the life of my previous Kindle. That said, it is sufficient for my needs as it will last about a week, reading a few hours a day.
The biggest frustration I have is the placement of the power button. It's on the bottom of the Kindle and I inadvertently turn it off because it's in a location that is a natural placement of my right hand while reading. When I repower it never returns to the last page that I've read, so sometimes takes a while to find where I left off.

Unfortunately, after a few years my previous paper white finally gave up. I was enthusiastic about ordering a new one, but after a few days of use I wish I still had my old one.

Overall at the recent promotional cost it's a good value. I only hope that I can get used to avoiding the power button on the bottom. If not I'm only going to become more frustrated with it. I believe that this could have easily been avoided by placing the power button on the top of the unit, or recessing the button itself. I'll either become comfortable holding it differently or become more frustrated over time. As they say, time will tell 🙂"
Robert Washam,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So I just received this product 2 hours ago. And I'm going to return it immediately. Whatever you do if you really want a good ebook reading device, don't buy this one. Here are the basic problems I found with it so far and why it's completely unusable:

1. I've registered this five or six times. It keeps unregistering itself when the top of the screen on the left displays ""verify account."" This is interesting because in the browser is clearly showing me my account page.
2. The wireless was also very difficult to set up and apparently it doesn't support the 5 gigahertz band because it would only connect to the to gigahertz band. In 2019, this is ridiculous.
3. The device honestly feels like a $20 children's toy instead of $150 tool for being able to read e content. I can't see the screen well I certainly can't see anything well in the browser that comes up. Oh, and about that browser-- it's so slow and updating the Paperwhite display. Scrolling with it is futile. I can't imagine actually using it for anything much less getting on the Amazon website which is feature content excessive. All of the animations and scrolling and ads and such on the Amazon website make the browser so painful to use. Also, getting back to the ""settings "" screen is impossible at times. Like when the web browser is running.
4. Just looking at the screen and the Amazon website on it (since without it being fully registered I can't get any of the paid Kindle content that I have, given the fact that I'm a Kindle unlimited user) I can't imagine using this to actually read a book. It's just simply not eye friendly.

To give you an idea of what I was expecting, I have an original Kindle Paperwhite. It had pretty bad software but it was nice having the 3G built in so you could download content. The web browser and the PDF viewer on it were very primitive and they didn't work well so that's when I started going to tablets. I have the top-of-the-line Kindle Fire tablet from 2018, Kindle unlimited which I run on every device that I can which includes my six other tablets and I have seven cell phones around here. I also view the content on my various laptops and what I really was looking for is a portable device with the Paperwhite screen that I would be able to actually use not only out in the sun but also indoors were it was darker because of LED illumination. I thought that's what this was going to be and it certainly is not for me.

Buyer beware."
Carol Lucara,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was purchased with 3 months of kindle unlimited. Unfortunately, once given to someone, it was found that the kindle unlimited subscription could not be transferred to the amazon account that has ownership of the kindle. I spoke with a rep and a manager and nobody would allow for the subscription to be available to the appropriate person."
BadWolf221b,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When e-readers first came out, I received a Sony Reader for Christmas and I absolutely loved it. The display was exactly like looking at the page of a book and it didn’t glare, and the books for it were really cheap. Eventually the battery wouldn’t hold a charge, and it was harder to buy books for it so I quit using it and went back to plain old books. I finally broke down and bought the Kindle Paperwhite on Prime day. I’ve been using it for a while now, trying to get used to it so I could leave an honest review. But no matter how hard I try I can’t make myself like it. It has a glare sometimes so it’s not truly like a book page, and for some reason glares drive me crazy. It’s supposed to be waterproof so I’ve used it a bit out at the pool, but after being outside for a while it gets so hot I’m afraid I’m going to ruin it if I keep it out. Turning pages is a nightmare. Sometimes it turns the page, then sometimes it doesn’t do anything at all. I’ll try to turn it again and it turns a whole bunch of pages, so I have to figure out which page I was trying to get to in the first place. A lot of times it doesn’t register when I’m trying to select something with the touchscreen, especially on the Kindle store. I’ll have to try to select something multiple times before it will ever open. Kindle books are also more expensive than I expected, many books I’ve looked at haven’t been much cheaper than their print version. It’s a lot easier to carry around instead of lugging a bunch of books with you everywhere, but that’s the only positive I’ve been able to find so far. I’ll probably use it when I’m going to be moving around a lot to save from carrying a book with me, but I’m most likely going to stick with my plain old paper books and hope I don’t run out of space to put them."
C. Loyd,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am the type of person that always has a book to read and like to actually have the book in my hand. For awhile I have wanted to try a Kindle, but thought I would not like it since I’m a book collector, too. I got the Kindle App and really liked it. I ordered the new Kindle and absolutely love it. I can read all types of books and in some cases get the audiobook for free, but I’ve never used audiobooks before. The Kindle itself is user friendly, but I wish it was in color because the book covers are hard to see for me, even when on a bright setting. Plus I’d like to see an off white background instead of stark white or black. I do like the inverted feature for reading at night and you do not need a light on which helps to let your partner sleep for late night reads. also it’s really neat that you can change the font as well as the page layout and make the text bigger to fit your own needs. I highly recommend the Kindle due to convenience to order a book right away and download it instantly as well as if you are one that likes to carry a book around. It’s smaller than I thought but it’s slim and fits in a purse nicely. I did not think I’d like it but I love it and glad I purchased it. Now I can carry thousands of books with me and always have something to read."
silvercrayon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an earlier version of the paperwhite. Easier to use, downloaded faster, setting and features easy to intuit. This one is slow to download, shuts off if you leave it sitting and doesn't continue download and except for the built-in light, is an inferior product to the older version. I can't comment yet on battery life but just letting it set, face down for a week drained almost 40%. Either this is a terrible upgrade of a formerly great device or I got a lemon.

Update: Had a call from customer service. Some idiot (my impression) changed the display so that the number shown in the corner of the book cover is not how much has been downloaded but shows how much of the book you have read. Frankly, I think knowing that the book is downloading is more important than telling me how much I've read. So, except for a POSSIBLE battery issue, there isn't any malfunctions. Also be advised to go into advance settings and get rid of the crap you see and have your library come up without fumbling around."
PeP,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I already owned the previous version of Paperwhite but wanted to add my Audible account with the new waterproof Bluetooth version. Of course, I can use my phone for listening to Audible, but why run down its battery? Plus, by listening on this new Paperwhite you don't have other apps, calls, or notifications interfering or slowing down your listening pleasure.

So far, I'm really enjoying it, however, navigating the VoiceView screen reader accessibility has a bit of learning curve (Kindle does have an onboard tutorial to follow) and I suppose this would seem more difficult for anyone who is legally blind, at least until they get the knack of it (that’s just my guess anyway).

The voice itself is impressive and sounds quite a bit like a human female (and unsure at this point if it can be changed to a male), instead of more like a robot. You can actually have some of your kindle and kindle unlimited books read to you in a nice voice. And of course, your purchased Audibles read via the book’s actual narrator.

I really like the fact that the Kindle itself seems a little lighter and a tiny bit smaller than its predecessor. I actually wanted to see why my old cover wouldn't fit the newer version...but realized the old cover is just a micrometer too big for this new model…you will have to buy a new one for a proper fit.

I also read some reviews here that mentioned they got 6 months of free Kindle Unlimited with their purchase, however my device got only 3 free months’ worth.

And BTW, I haven't tried immersing it in water yet to see how that works, but I don't plan on it either..."
Rainer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my new Kindle, until about a week ago. It disconnected from WiFi, and would not reconnect. It kept saying that the password was incorrect, so I tried it on several different WiFi networks between home, work and friends houses. One of the WiFi's was not even password protected, but still received the same issue.
I contacted Amazon support, and after trying everything they asked me to, they finally decided that they would send me a replacement, only to find out that the replacement they will be sending me is a refurbished Kindle. This would be understandable if my Kindle was more than a few months old, but considering that I only purchased it at the end of November, making it less than 4 months I've had it in hand, I strongly feel this is unacceptable. The issue with the Kindle was not due to anything I did - it sits on my bedside table, and is used for 1-2 hours a day, charging over night only when the battery gets to 5% or less. This maybe a negative that is more against Amazon, but as it was this device the review will be here."
Deb66,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say I am not very impressed with it. I love the battery life. It is longer than my older one. My older one also has a built in light and touch screen that works well. When I heard that I could transfer my books from the one to the other, I was excited. What I didn't know was that they would not be transferred in the book collection that I had most of them in, so I have to go through my new Kindle and put my books in the book collections. They should have transferred the way they were, but now I have to do it again. I had to do it the first time. Also, I paid for audio and don't see anywhere or anyway to use that. So I am a bit disappointed in it."
Professed Read-aholic,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved, loved my Kindle Fire that I bought in May of 2017. Unfortunately, last week it simple died. Will not charge, cannot boot it up, just done for which surprises me because I would think it would last longer than two years. So, I looked at the current Kindle tablet options and am not savy enough to figure out if that would be the best replacement for my Kindle Fire. As I predominantly used my Kindle for reading, I decided to order the Kindle Paperwhite. I have now used it for four days and really have to say I don't like it. It is small, there is NO color anywhere (I am used to seeing the color of the covers of the hundreds of books I own), it only holds the chosen orientation for reading, not for the home page, I want my home page to only have books on it that I have not read or am currently reading but I can't make that happen. I am considering returning it and ordering a tablet but I read a number of problems with that device also. Any advice would be much appreciated."
Aristotle,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned two previous kindles spanning a few generations. So I was looking forward to upgrading to this version since it’s waterproof and it has compatibility with audiobooks. However, I can not recommend the product for people like me who mainly read at nighttime or in the dark. More below.

MY USAGE CONTEXT
I’m a light sleeper. For years I would get up at night and watch TV or use my cell phone. Then I learned about how bad that can be - it is for me - and a doctor recommended reading instead of watching TV. But I did not want to turn the lights on to read, as it would definitely wake my body up even more and wake my wife who was sleeping soundly. So eventually I stumbled upon a kindle reader and that changed my life. I could now read in bed without turning on the lights and it would help me fall back asleep pretty quickly.

So given that context, here’s why I don’t recommend this kindle for night reading.

IT HAS TO “WAKE UP”
This one was surprising to me. This new kindle actually needs to “wake up” much like a computer. It takes about 2-3 seconds for it to do so. It’s a nitpick, but my previous models did not do this.

WHEN IT “WAKES UP”, IT USES THE MAXIMUM BACKLIGHT
This is my real issue with the “waking up”. No matter what level you had last left the backlight on, when it wakes up it shines extremely bright for those 2-3 seconds. It actually causes me serious discomfort b/c I’m in a very dark environment (remember my context) and this bright light just blasts on. I also lights up the room you are in, like a cell phone flashlight. So if anyone else is in the room they will notice the light.

IT IS A WHITE BACKLIGHT
My previous kindles had a blueish backlight. That was a lot easier on my eyes. This one has a white backlight.

THE BACKLIGHT IS TOO BRIGHT
Not sure if it’s b/c of the white tone backlight, but this kindle is way too bright. I have the backlight set to 1 - the lowest it goes before turning off - and it still lights up my room like a weak flashlight. I can’t read it in the typical darkness of night b/c it causes me so much eye strain.

So those are the reasons that I will return this kindle and looked for an older model. If you are going to use this kindle outdoors and in a pool or beach scenario, then this may be the one for you. If you are a night reader like me, stay away from this model and look for one of the models with a blue backlight."
DrMommy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this product so I could read in the middle of the night while feeding our new baby. My iPad is just too bright, so I needed something that wouldn't wake the baby with all the light it put out. I also hated the on-screen glare from the iPad when I was trying to read around fluorescent lights.

To preface this review, I do have an engineering degree, and I'm also an eye doctor. So I have high standards for my vision and am picky! And I was not impressed with the clarity of the words on the screen. It took me almost a month to adjust to how they are not as crisp as what I was used to on the iPad. It drove me batty that the resolution just wasn't there. No matter what the font size, the words just weren't clear. Also, I still had glare on the screen in certain circumstances, although much improved from the iPad. I also didn't like how when scrolling to a new page, it takes too a few milliseconds too long to load. Again, this is all compared to my iPad.

Overall, though, this is an inexpensive device that is lightweight and easy to carry it around. The battery will last for at least 3-4 books, and the device does not put out enough light to wake the baby. For that reason, I did still give it a good rating!"
Willow H.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: I’m changing my rating because amazon contacted me about my kindle. They were extremely helpful and professional. We reset my kindle and updated the software. That seemed to do the trick! The battery is behaving perfectly. I’m so happy to have my kindle back.... (if anyone is having battery issues try resetting it! It really works!)
So I ordered a new paper white first of January. Less than 24 hours after I had it it wouldn’t keep a charge. Literally delivered at 2 pm on Saturday and by Sunday mid morning it wouldn’t hold a charge. So it took about an hour with amazon chat to get a replacement sent. They kept wanting to just try a different charger. But because it was so brand new I insisted on a replacement because I knew it wasn’t the charger. Well I’ve had this replacement since then and it’s been fine. The battery isn’t as good as my 3rd edition but still I could live with it. Well now I can’t even finish a book without the battery going dead! Charged it Friday night and read two hours. Saturday morning it was at 12%. So I charged it Saturday morning and read for maybe three hours and when I went back to finish my book that night the battery was dead again. So I charged it this morning. Guess what? The battery is dead at 9:30 pm. After being fully charged this morning and I didn’t even read on it. I’m. So. Frustrated. No WiFi on and the lighting is down lower than I like just to conserve the battery. I’m not even sure I want a replacement at this point. I think I’ll just go back to my 3rd edition that’s 6 years old. That thing will hold a charge forever."
hougal,2.0 out of 5 stars,"my 2 year old kindle didn't seem like it was holding a charge the same way it used to. So I ordered one of these. Went to move my collections to the new Kindle. Old collections NAMES showed up on my new kindle. With the old kindles, the books came along with the collection. Sure - the books came along, but you have to INDIVIDUALLY load them. Since some of my collections have over 100 books, that wasn't going to happen in my world. CHatted with amazon to find out why this was working this way, they told me they would get back with me, and they never did.
Plus the font was different. 2 kindles side by side on the same page - old kindle had more lines than the new one.

I was supposed to get a credit by sending my old kindle in. I kept waiting for an answer about the collections, but decided to send the new one back and keep the old one."
Edishop,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Kindle to replace my fifth generation version, because of a few features that I really wanted. After 6 months of use, here's the good and bad I've discovered to date.

The Good:
Backlight feature. A main reason why I upgraded from my old Kindle, was the backlight. I really appreciate that now I can read in low light settings (hello airplanes and while in bed). It's the main reason why I upgraded my Kindle, because trying to read a Kindle with a booklight just got annoying over the years. Now I don't need the light anymore.

Book covers on the home screen. Viewing book covers on the home screen was a delightful surprise. I know how much work goes into every feature of developing a book, including the cover design, and it's fun to see some of the amazing work that's been done. It also makes shifting through what books and samples I have to read easier to manage than with my old Kindle where it was just a page after page of a list of titles. Now I feel more like I'm browsing in a bookstore, which I've always loved to do.

Waterproof. I don't plan to drop this thing in the tub, but I do associate being waterproof with being a bit durable. Only time will tell if this will be true or not.

The Bad
Battery life. My number one complaint with my new Kindle is the awful battery life. Even when the back light and wifi settings are turned off, I can barely get a day out of this thing before it dies. I'm shocked because my fifth generation Kindle used to last for a week before needing a re-charge and I expected a newer version to last longer, not shorter. I can't imagine this thing lasting on a long plane ride.

Forced into Goodreads services with one touch. I shy away from all things social media as much as I can, and just about had a nervous breakdown when after one touch of the finger a Goodreads account was AUTOMATICALLY created for me. Then I had to run around trying to figure out how to get RID of the Goodreads account I never wanted.

Look I get it, some people adore social media and don't mind having their name and habits broadcasted for all the world to see. BUT, that's only some people, not ALL people. Plus, while I find reviews are important and I try to be diligent to write them for anything I have tried, I do not want my habits broadcasted for the world to see. What I'm reading and when is my business, not others. While I was eventually able to close the Goodreads account, I should not have had to run around trying to opt out, I should have been asked if I wanted to opt in, not be forced into it. Even worse, I still haven't figure out a way to remove the Goodreads option from the home screen, so I try to be very mindful that I do NOT want to touch that thing again.

Page turning. The touch screen option is fine, but you can only go forward when touching the right side of the screen which means you can only do so with your right hand. With my old Kindle which hand didn't matter I could turn the page with either, but now I constantly have to readjust when I want to turn the page. It's also annoying that sometimes my finger brushes the page and it will turn. That touch screen is sensitive!

Ads, Ads, Ads. I purchased the ad free version, but the default home screen is so buy with recommendations, and what's new, etc, that I felt like I was dealing with ads anyway. I couldn't even find my purchased books at first! Thankfully you can turn off all of the noise and now I have a clean menu with only the books I am reading, but it was a bit of work to clean everything up.

Overall, I don't think this new Kindle is bad, as it does have some nice features (yay backlight and book covers), but the few things I've run into that are bad, for me are really bad (battery, auto sign-up to Goodreads) and why the rating is not higher."
Mr Ken,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this during prime day for my wife who reads lots of books. We've used the paper white (one of the original versions), but most recently the typical fire tablet. I dislike this reader and is hard to use. The screen is too busy for a black and white screen that is ink driven and it simply is too much. The menus are difficult to get around and the feel is cheap. Piece of advice to Amazon, enough with all the pushing of stuff, ads and cluttered screens. This is a book, first and foremost, something to read and enjoy, not be overwhelmed with.

I really hate leaving reviews like this, but for me - it was a waste of money."
Jennifer Bull,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded my previous paperwhite to this one and I have regretted it ever since. This Kindle moves so slowly that it is difficult to tell when it is moving glacially slowly and when it just isn't registering that you've touched the screen. Both are constant problems.

I can't even figure out how to return it as that doesn't seem to be an option, even though I am still paying on the stupid thing.

This isn't a better paperwhite, it is simply a newer, more clunky, slower, and infinitely crappier version of the previous paperwhite. I was so excited because I loved my previous paperwhite and I figured a newer one that is also waterproof would be great and it is the worst product I've ever wasted my money on.

My old paperwhite has two spots where the screen is a little messed up and it is still better than this POS

Don't buy this, it is a complete waste of money and in no way an improvement over the previous paperwhite. I'm thinking of just reselling this one when I get it paid off and using the old one instead of this one, even though I've given it 5 months, is consistently awful.."
Michele Zmich,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love love love this. It’s perfect I took this to Ireland with me for three weeks. So much easier than carting books. I did not have luck with other E readers in the past when reading in sunlight. This one is perfect.
Ronald S. Cresap,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is waterproof. Otherwise I would have kept my old Kindle wihte model 5.. I use t for all of my reading of fioction from my library. I lve it.
Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was previously using a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 to do my reading and watching videos. I decided to switch to a Kindle Paperwhite because the kindle fire was too heavy and the backlighting was straining my eyes.
My first impression of this new device is that it is definitely slimmer and lighter which is good (it even feels like its lighter than my iPhone 7). It is also waterproof and has inversion of text so that it is easier to read at night (no comfort lighting though). I also liked that they included bluetooth for audio book listening. However, my Kindle Fire already had this function plus Immersion reading (which this doesn't have). This wasn't too much of a big deal, since I don't really use audio books and if I did I guess I could always use my kindle fire.
One of my complaints is the power button position on the new 2018 paper white. The power button sticks out and is in a position where my hands accidentally press the power button. My kindle has the power button on the side and it doesn't stick out, so I never have the issue with accidentally pressing it.
This new device has a flush screen which I am pretty use to since all of my devices seem to have one (cell phone and the kindle fire). It does attract more fingerprints but so does my other devices. Its easy to clean and doesn't really bother me. People have said that this device has more glare than the previous model, but I can't really compare because I've never owned the previous models. All I can say is that there is less of a glare compared to my iPhone and kindle fire which is a huge difference for me. I do wish they had the color white like they did for the previous model. Overall, it looks aesthetically beautiful because of the flushed screen and I have seen pictures of the previous model on the bottom where it was a bit thick, this one is flat and slim. I also like the fact that you can temporarily disable the touch screen (if the previous model didn't have it that would be kind of annoying for me because I accidently touch the screens pages and go to the next page). As for the battery life amazon says that if you read for 30 mins a day with the light setting at 10 it should last for weeks. I'm not sure how true this is I read for a couple of hours and the battery life went down by 10%. I don't think this will be an issue because it still lasts longer than my kindle fire would and I can always just plug it in to charge it. I would recommend this device if you need a waterproof and lightweight reading device."
Jeepers,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really like the new Paperwhite. I upgraded from an old generation of Kindle. I like the size and weight of this one. Touchscreen works well and the battery lasts a good long time. It has rekindled my enyoyment of reading again. I got the bigger storage though it may be a long time before I fill it up. Screen reader is difficult to get used to but the voice quality is pretty good. Easy to listen to. Requires Bluetooth as there are no speakers. Sparseness of controls is nice. Simple is better for me. The only thing I would change is to move the power button off the bottom. A couple of times I've accidently put it to sleep trying to hold it on the bottom and hitting the button. Oh well. Not a biggie.
J Anderson Williams,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I rest my Kindle on flat surfaces to read & have done so for several years ... until I bought this model

Although it sometimes takes several pokes w my finger to get the Kindle to power up, it frequently partially or fully powers ... sometimes losing my place in the book, sometimes erasing my library off the device! ... unpredictably when I place bottom on flat surface to read.

Thinking I had just purchased a lemon, I replaced a Paperwhite that was less than a year old (2019) rather that wait for repairs. Sadly, the Replacement unit (this one) does the same thing

Previous Kindle models did not have this issue. It is difficult to rate/ heavily weight the utility of bells & whistles the user has available when the unit is on. ... when the user’s attention focused on hoping the unit will stay energized"
Jason Pratt,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Lots of people have their own reviews, but be aware that although this is still marketed as having 3G connectivity, apparently it isn't being offered with 3G connectivity anymore. This was a major annoyance for me when it arrived: I had searched to find the 3G option, and never found a distinction to choose that or only Wi-Fi; so since Amazon was still marketing it with 3G, I inferred it must come automatically with any of these models. NOPE!

This seems to be a leftover marketing promise from prior versions which did feature the option to pay one time (a higher price of course, it isn't really ""free"") for permanent 3G. This option has now been migrated up to the larger new Paperwhite -- and removed from this model. Marketing just hasn't caught up yet.

Fortunately I only used 3G rarely on my old Kindle (which had a physical keyboard, too, so I wouldn't smear the screen touching it all the time.) But it was great to have when I needed it, so... sigh."
nina,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle Paperwhite failed after 7 months - yes, one month after the support limit. It randomly skips and jumps pages, goes unbidden to the dictionary, does whatever it wants to do with no direction from me. It is unusable. Needless to say, this is a great disappointment. I have not been able to find out how to contact Amazon about this problem anywhere on the website."
Kitten,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I picked up this new kindle because of the waterproof feature - there's nothing else to recommend it over the Gen. 6 Kindle which I've been using for 4 years. I read extensively while sunbathing, so the waterproof feature was a welcome upgrade for using outdoors around water during the summer months. HOWEVER, I have found that this Kindle cannot take the heat. Earlier today I was reading outside in the sun on an 82 degree day - with the Kindle inside a cover - and after only 55 minutes, an error message popped up saying that it was overheating and would be suspending soon. This was the 2nd time that has happened. So, unless you're only going to use this device inside in a cool environment, you might want to skip this until the engineers get their act together and figure out how to make this new Kindle work as well as all the other previous models. I have spent hours reading outdoors in much hotter temps than 82 degrees using my 4-year old Gen. 6 model and it continues to work perfectly.
Update 6/25/19:. An update came through for this Kindle shortly after having this problem and after installing it, I haven't had the overheating problem again. I've used it multiple times now out in the heat and have received no overheating notifications. So, fingers crossed - it's working as it should."
Monika,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite is my first e-reader, and I have a massive pet-peeve with it. The power button is on the bottom, which means that I can't read while my kindle is ""standing up"" (i.e. on a table, leaning against the wall for hands-free reading), because the weight of the Kindle on its own power-button triggers it to turn off. Furthermore, the most comfortable position for me to hold the Kindle with my hands is to make a sort of L-shape with my thumb along the side and pinky-finger holding the base, with the rest of my fingers supporting the back of the Kindle. There have been several instances where I'm completely absorbed in a book, not paying attention to what my fingers are doing, and my pinky-finger hits the power-button and turns off the Kindle! If only they had put the power-button on the top or side, or programed an option to rotate the content on the screen 180degrees.

SOME SOLUTIONS / POSITIVE ASPECTS OF THE KINDLE PAPERWHITE:
- A bulky case could protect against accidental power-off's, but I love the minimalist/sleek design of the Kindle.
- Battery life is fantastic (not sure what what everyone else is complaining about). I took it on a 2-week vacation, read an entire 500page book, and never charged it once.
- Love how easy it is to rent library e-books and load them on my Kindle!
- USB-microUSB charging cable is super convenient
- I was skeptical of e-readers in general, and avoided buying one for a long time because I love the tactile sensation of a book so much. But the current series of books I'm reading is massive (each individual book is ridiculously large), plus I travel a lot. So I decided it was finally time to check out what these e-readers were all about. It felt strange at first, but I got used to it pretty quick, and it's absolutely 1000% better to travel with than a paper book."
N. Richards,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read myself to sleep every night, so the light is a real blessing. Also the battery seems to be upgraded -- lasts much longer than my older Kindle. The unit is very light, so when I drop it on my face, it doesn't hurt as much as when my iPad falls over on me. :--)) It is also light enough that I don't get thumb pain from holding a ""real"" book. I read 10 or 12 books a week and, while I enjoy ""real"" books, the Kindle is a blessing."
Donate Life - Organ donation saved the life of my loved one!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are buying this as your first Kindle you will love it! If you have the 2015 Paperwhite, not much of a change. I was not impressed with this new version. I LOVE my 2015 paperwhite. I convinced my 83 year old mom to get one and she loves it as well. For her, she can make the text huge and read it without her glasses. For me, I can read it in bed with the light turned low so it does not bother my husband. I bought this new version assuming it would be faster and better. It was not any faster. There were a few small improvements, but not enough for me to justify the price so I returned it. So glad I did not already ship my old kindle for the trade in deal! So again, if buying your first paperwhite you will love this. But if you have a 2015 paperwhite, I would keep that."
Tina,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the latest in my collection of Kindles, starting with a big ole' 2nd generation dinosaur that I gave to my sister when I bought a Kindle Touch. The Kindle Fire HDX I bought to replace the Touch stays on my nightstand for reading right before bed. I debated turning in the Touch for credit toward the Paperwhite, but my husband said he would love to have it so it's staying in the family. The Paperwhite is slightly smaller than the Touch and so light! I can easily keep it in my purse. The leather cover I purchased for it looks great and gives me a subtle ""holding a real book"" feel. I love the adjustable screen brightness and more fonts to choose from (though not all of them work in every book). The battery life is fabulous - I've seen reviews stating that wifi is draining so I only turn it on to sync and download. I hope I don't ever have to put the waterproof feature to the test... All in all, I love my Kindles!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle and so far I am very pleased. I was reading books using Libby on my phone/ipad but my eyes would get tired from the screen. I would also get distracted from reading by seeing notifications or having the internet at my fingertips when I wanted to look something up. I can still borrow books from Libby (which is what ultimately sold me), I love the look of the e-ink, and the battery life is amazing! I've been using my device for about a month now, reading every now and then and I'm still at 60%! I only turn the wifi on when I have to download or a return a book to the library, which definitely helps the battery last longer.
Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and I look forward to reading using this device. I love the highlight/notes/dictionary options while reading and the fact that I can leave my phone in another room so I can have screen-free reading time. I think it's worth it for people who love to read as I can imagine this would make a great companion while traveling, and it's so light and easy to take anywhere. I am honestly thinking of buying more as gifts for my family members."
CD1,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Mostly going to echo other people’s comments with the added note that the fact that patches STILL haven’t been released for the blinding light issue is sloppy and unconscionable.

1. When you wake up the device, it goes to full brightness before restoring to the user settings for lighting levels. This means that the device is blinding in a dark room. This has not been an issue with my previous Kindles.

2. The battery life is hot garbage and I leave mine on airplane mode. I had one of the earliest Kindles on the market followed by a couple of later versions and have never had such a short lived Kindle battery. This has been the only Kindle that’s made me nostalgic for paper books whose batteries never threaten to die mid-sentence.
3. Turning the pages of your library is an absolute nightmare with the touch screen. There’s an insufficient margin around the text such that if you’re trying to go to the next page of your library there’s a better than even chance that you’re going to unintentionally open a book instead. Doing so renders the “recent” sorting option rather useless.

4. I’m trusting that it’s waterproof. But I had a perfectly good waterproof case for my previous kindle and it had none of the issues of this version of the Paperwhite.

So I’m going back to my old Kindle and when it well and truly croaks, I’ll likely switch brands. I mostly get my books from the library these days anyway."
That Guy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My first kindle was the kindle keyboard. This was near perfect in every way for me as a student. This new Kindle is ok, many good and a few bad things. I will list them all here.
Good - The screen is clear, and smooth. The missing boarder and lack of bezel is a very welcome enhancement that improves the reading experience. That is about it, other than that its a kindle e reader.
Bad- For some odd reason I cannot figure out why when I brush the right side of the screen to change pages it pops up with the font size like I want to change the font size, this happens fairly regularly.
Battery is nothing like even my 4 year old Paperwhite that it replaced. I turn off bluetooth and turn airplane mode on for 95% of the time i use the device (I use it to read, and rarely have to download a new book or something). I get 3-4 days without charging, thats with 1-2 hours of reading per day and the other 23-24 hours in standby. I charge it about every other night so its not a huge deal but its far less than advertised.
Audiobook support, this was the feature I was looking forward to the most and let me down the most. It will only sync up with audiable. If you get audio book by any other means such as the library there is no way to play them on the kindle. Iti is only available to listen to on bluetooth, no speaker and no 3.5mm port for headphones. I wasted money on the 32gb model hoping I would be able to use the audiobook function, the keyboard did and if only it had a backlight I would still be using it (and the battery would still be better than the battery on this model.)"
Natasha S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I keep upgrading Kindles; I’ve had four previous to thus version. I upgraded to have a waterproof version and to invert black and white. I gifted my previous one.
I wish I had kept the old one.
Suddenly, instead of the already-meager week I get between charging (original Kindles gave me almost a month at my useage), I’m only getting a day. I’ve had it six weeks, my usesge hasn’t changed. I have the Bluetooth off, wireless off, I even paid to remove ads. It was at 100% yesterday morning at 10:45. At 10pm it was at 6%. I plugged it in overnight. I unplugged at 6:15 this morning, I’ve read maybe 45 minutes, and I’m down to 73%. It’s like the sleep function isn’t sleeping. Thinking of calling customer service.
Keep your older Paperwhite; the upgrade isn’t worth it, and that’s from a dedicated Kindle user since 2008.

UPDATE: Amazon Tech Support called me after this review went up, which was nice. We did a hard re-set. The battery problem only lasted a few days and then it went back to 7-9 days I was getting before the weird glitchy weekend. It’s possible my case wasn’t properly ‘sleeping’ the device, though why it would only be for two days, after six weeks of working fine, is a mystery. I also spent the $20 to remove the ‘special offers’, which I think was also helpful as it was less processing it had to do when I opened up. So, battery life is back to this version’s normal, which could definitely be improved. I don’t know if the lack of bevel (which is nice) and waterproof (nice) and invert black-and-White (nice) are worth the upgrade and reduced battery life. Bottom line: not a huge change, so probably not an urgent upgrade. But it does have some nice features. Amazon, you seriously exaggerate the battery life, which really needs improving back to original-Kindle performance."
Suellen Helinski,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this Kindle Paperwhite as a gift. Amazon had a great deal of trouble sending the reader to me: the first one didn't arrive until weeks after I was informed that it had arrived; the second was mailed to the wrong address (in the wrong state); the third arrived at last. After registering the Paperwhite I tried to charge it. That's when I realized that the cable was included, but not the power plug. It wasn't missing from the box, which was too slim to accommodate the power plug. My husband has an older version, from 2017. That version was cheaper and included the power plug. I wish my gift had been the older, cheaper, version which was mailed complete."
Joseph Blanton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife attempted to buy the previous generation Kindle, because of some of the negative reviews about this kindle. Thankfully Target didn't have the previous gen so she got me this one instead. I love it, it is light, has a super fast page turn, it's nice knowing that a little splash of coffee won't kill it and it has made me a fan of kindle reading all over again. The backlight is perfect, and turning it all the way down is perfect for reading in the day/sun. I am back to my minimalist ways after getting tired of books piling up around the house. Here are a couple of the negative comments that people have been leaving.
1. ""the glare, oh the glare, how can it say anti-glare and then I go out in the sun and I have to squint!""
First of all, that's just drama. Try wearing sunglasses next time you are outside or sit in the shade. I am pretty sure, the last I checked, even paper books can be hard to see without them. First day I had it, sat by the pool all day and read. Not once did I notice a glare.
2. ""the slick glass layout of the design makes it prone to chipping, my toddler knocked it off the couch and it chipped the screen a little bit.""
hmmm, I have toddlers. You leaving your device in their reach is not the kindle's fault. They are known to destroy everything in their path, and no fortress is strong enough to withstand their furry. This is definitely a ""you"" problem.
3. Here are some highlights of other comments.

“It’s infuriating that Amazon went to market with this machine. Do not upgrade from prior Paperwhites.”
Amazon producing a new kindle is infuriating? Forget everything I know about human rights issues. Sound the alarm bells.
“To unlock the device, it goes through a long “waking up” period where the backlight is turned up full blast for some reason. It then reverts to your normal backlight setting after unlocking. I blind myself every night reading in bed.”
Please just go to a doctor, any doctor. They should be able to help you with these feelings.

“Bottom line: this is not a finished product, and they shoved it out the door because they wanted to have it out for Christmas.”
Hey you are the one who wanted it for Christmas, so there is that part of it as well.

“Without Wi-Fi, you can't use it.”
Yeah that’s been true for a decade now. But since it’s waterproof, you can use it as a coaster.

I am being sarcastic because people are drama about the funniest things. It’s a great kindle. Buy one, and remember you do need Wifi lol."
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars," When I go to turn the page or just slide my finger down, if it's been idle, to be sure it doesn't time out and the font will just start changing. It will not stop until I turn it off. I did let Amazon know but no response. It just seems to have slow response compared to previous version. (See video)"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed!! I bought this as a gift for my grandson, so he could read along with the text while Audible is reading it to him. But, unlike the Kindle App on android and iPhones, where the text being read is highlighted while Audible is reading it, this device only seems to allow one or the other. You can either read the text on the virtual page, or listen to the narration, while looking at a fixed screen showing only the audio controls. Why would Amazon limit this latest and ""greatest"" version when their Kindle App allows this? The reason i bought the dedicated Kindle Paperwhite was so that the child could enjoy the book without the distraction of all the other apps that are on his iPhone. This device will have to go back.
UPDATE:
Still disappointed, but I'm adding 1 star for the simple reason that within a few hours of my origin review, a very sincere Amazon customer service associate called to see if he could help make it right, or assist in the return. He confirmed the limitation that I reported and said he also didn't understand why this dedicated Kindle would not have the same capabilities as the kindle app for Android and iPhones. He reported he would submit the concern to the kindle development engineers and hopefully they would upgrade the software with equivalent capabilities in the future. So my message to the Amazon IT engineers is: Consider ALL your potential users and ALL the possible ways they might use your products. This device is prefect for a young student to help develop their love of reading while also developing their reading skills. I have decided to keep it and hope that it gets used for its intended purpose. (This is one of the advantages of brick and mortar stores, I would have detected this limitation prior to purchase)"
MLT,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon still hasn't addressed a basic design flaw.

The battery connection - the USB port - is incredibly fragile (moreso than most such ports).

I strongly suspect this is a bit of built-in obsolescence.

Get a magnetic charging dongle and plug that in - leave it plugged in - never take it out.

I'm not a big fan of how much they've desensitized the touch-screen.

I know there was some complaining about how sensitive the prior model was but it doesn't seem impossible to make that a user setting.

I find myself having to shift the device and very deliberately ""turning the page"" because it's set too low (for me).

If there were a serious competitor that could easily download Amazon literary material, I'd get it instead, but there isn't.

Amazon has settled for ""just good enough"" for the most part and that's disappointing."
Maria Elena,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle reader is an excellent device. Once a book is downloaded (free from your local library using the Overdrive app) it can be read anywhere! It is thin enough to pack in your carry on and can be read at airports as it needs no further wifi connection. The lighting is perfect to be read in the brightest of sunlight, even at the beach. It is thin and has a very long battery life. I have left it in my beach bag for days and it is still charged and ready when I am. The best part is the font can be enlarged for easy reading. Also, once the book is read it automatically returns without a need to go to the library!"
Brandon M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't buy from amazon I bought it from best buy

It looks like moving paper on a screen that can emit light and hold has as much books as you want basically, waterproof and still light as a bag of feathers the only bad thing is if you get water on it its so sensitive that it will turn your page for a couple seconds, but i still give it a 5 star because it's everything i need to read."
Linda Losch,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My new kindle would not work. When I was reading, sometimes when I touched the screen to go to the next page, it wouldn’t go to the next page. I would keep touching the screen & finally it would work. I am in the process of having it replaced, which is confusing. I was supposed to have it Sat 11/10. As of Tues 11/13, I don’t have it. My original one is to b picked up Wed, 11/14. Confused in PA."
Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I know a lot of people seem to have mixed thoughts on the kindle paperwhite. Personally, after using it for a few weeks now, I still haven't had to charge it since the first time I did. The set up was relatively fast. I did have an issue where the book covers for the ebooks didn't show up but after about 2 hours it was fine.

It does take time to fully integrate! For mine, it was about 2 hours with a consistent internet connection. Some ppl might be less or more, but I was able to have everything there fairly quickly.

The only real downside I can find is that there seems to be a slight lag when pressing on the touchscreen. I imagine it's a processing thing with the operating system where it isn't as sophisticated as other tablets but it's not a big deal.

The screen is really what I bought for it. It is a LOT easier on my eyes than any other tablet I've used for my ebooks. It makes reading for hours a lot better so it's nice to not have the eye strain.

A lot of people mentioned the ads, they only show up in the ""Recommended"" and when the screen first opens up. Besides that, its no big deal. I can read for hours without any type of ad bothering me if that is a concern. You will only see the ads when you start it up and on the home screen.

So I guess my only complaint is the slight lag I see when I press on the touchscreen. I imagined something a little better for price I paid for it, but it works and it doesn't freeze up. IT just needs a few seconds.

I would still recommend this to anyone looking for a better eReader. It's nice and small and much easier on the eyes."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this new paperwhite based on the advertisement saying it was so much better than the previous one. I have had this one since May and absolutely hate it, I hate it so much I am going back to my original paperwhite that never gave me any problems. While there is a good battery life, it is no better than the one I bought in 2014. The downloading time seems about the same. It will frequently change font size while I am reading causing me to have to get out of the book and go into settings which also doesn't respond very well at all. Just today I got a new book and had to turn my machine off in order to reboot it because when I tried to read the new book a smaller version of the first page came on and no amount of touching the X would make it respond. All in all I am EXTREMELY disappointed, also embarrassed that I have suggested to many people that they should buy one because I love mine so much. Unfortunately, I am now out $119 for something that doesn't work as advertised. Lesson learned, don't be fooled into thinking that newer is better."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Paperwhite. I also have the original which my husband is using now.

I love my Kindles because they are just like reading a book. Especially with the backlight they are perfect for reading in bed.

I upgraded mainly because the new one is waterproof and audible compatible. I have not tested the waterproofing so I can't say how well it works. I also didn't realise that audible is only accessable through bluetooth.

What I do like is that the touch screen is more responsive than on my old one.
It would be nice if the lighting would auto adjust like on the fire tablet. I hate having to still change that manually.

Overall they are very similar and if you have an older Paperwhite it's not really worth to upgrade. Unless you are into audiobooks and/or need the waterproofing.

Something I would like to see on future Kindles is to be able to zoom on the screen. Since the display text size can't be changed, it is sometimes difficult to read reviews or look at pictures."
catherine s fisher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was shocked, actually, at how small this reader is; not because the dimensions were not given, but because I was thinking it was the size of my husband's Paperwhite which is about 2x as large. However, once I started using this compact little reader, I found it to be excellent. The lighting is good. Using it outside was really good. My older Kindle was not useable in the sun. This one seems to work fine. Also surprising is the battery storage. Kindle's overall have very good battery life but this little one is better than the older models. I think the dictionary access is also better.
I am not wild about the touch screen, yet. Maybe it takes getting use to. There is no home button on the bottom of page as on the older models. I find this inconvenient. While a small thing, I miss the blue book mark. There is a bookmark but not as appealing, to me anyway. I do wish the chargers were interchangeable. Amazon sends a cable but no converter (transformer). Luckily the USB is standard and I could use my iPhone converter. Not convenient though. Overall this reader fits the bill of easy to read inside and out. An added plus is it fits easily in a handbag and does not weigh too much to carry around."
Sashin,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted this new paperwhite for a trip I was going on. I was disappointed from the outset because the cord, included with the device, did not it in the charging port. I chatted with Amazon and they had a fix right away for it...which leads me to believe...and rightly so...that this is an ongoing problem. They credited me the price of the cord and there was no shipping. When it arrived 2 days later it did indeed charge my paperwhite. So I got to try it out for the first time. Preregistered so that eliminated that hassle. I also read the updated Paperwhite mini book to figure out how to use it. Seemed easy enough. I down loaded my books and wanted to start reading but it was very annoying to do so. The screen was not a bright as I had hoped..and that was at night. When turning a page, the screen jiggled from white to black to white again. It was a second or so but it drove me crazy. The print is rather...fuzzy? Not as crisp as one would want when reading. I returned the paperwhite and the extra cord and the cover for the device."
Lyle Clayton,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They need WRITTEN instructions on how to get to the instructions within the device. I got to them by accident, but then could not get back to them. I may not be the most technologically advanced, but it should be something in the settings.

I purchased primarily to check out electronic books offered by our library, many are only offered in e-books. Four days after checkout, message received that my loan expires soon. I don't understand why the loan period differs from a standard library loan.

I like the size and adjustability for reading. Font and brightness adjustement, etc. But it is just not an enjoyable unit to use. I had to do an online search to figure out how to turn off the touchscreen.

I want to love it, but sitting down to relax and read turned into a frustrating experience. I will work with it a little longer, but most likely it will be returned."
Myndi,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this! Its like reading a real paper book but having the convenience of the small size. It also has a built in light for if you are reading in the dark but has the option for no light at all so that you can have the closest to a paper reading experience as possible. The only things i dont like is that you can only purchase books from amazon. This is just inconvenient for me because i used to have a nook and i cannot transfer the books i purchased with them onto this one. Also, when it is sleeping, there is always an ad for the kindle store books. You cannot choose your own background. This is super annoying. Idk if there is a way to turn that off or not though. I have not been able to figure out a way."
Tammy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband bought me the 32 GB (Wi-Fi, without offers) for Christmas. I have until the end of the month to make a decision on whether or not I want to keep it. I have owned the keyboard, touch and the previous two Paperwhite's. I still have the previous Paperwhite and will keep it as a backup - or go back to it if I return this one. I had no issues with that one...I just wanted something with more storage for my Audible books and I really liked the idea of the screen being one continuous piece without the bezel.

Like many have said before me, this thing is a fingerprint magnet and there is absolutely no way around it short of wearing gloves when you are handling it. I find I'm constantly wiping the front off off because it drives me nuts. Maybe if they come out with a white one it won't be as noticeable on the casing surround the reading screen, but it sure is on the black one. Just entering my pass code leaves little marks on the screen as does when you turn the page, hit the home button, etc. I'm not sure why they changed the texture of the screen when the previous one was phenomenal and didn't leave prints. I ordered a skin that will cover the black portion, which I've used on all my previous Kindles to make it look more original. With that taking care of the fingerprint issue on the case I will only have to worry about the actual reading screen. Hopefully that will be enough to curb my OCD.

I also experienced battery issues. I fully charged it on the 30th, unplugged it and went back to it an hour later and it was at 94%. I did what others suggested and did a hard reset to see if that would help. I will keep an eye on it - I'm a heavy reader and charged my previous one every 2-3 weeks. I was busy the past few days and didn't use it as much as I normally would have. I also have this one set up with the same day and night settings as my last one to compare. As it is, it looks like it will have to be charged every weekly, if not sooner - it has already dropped to 56%. That's a considerable drop from my old one. Disappointing and no where near as long lasting.

On the plus side, it is soooo light - easy to hold and balance and use the same hand to turn pages. Buttons for page turning would be awesome, but not a deal breaker for me. I also want to point out the on/off button placement. It does seem more sensitive - I never ""accidentally"" turned off my other one when handling/reading. I've done it several times with this one.

So with that being said...I'm on the fence. It's a lot of money to spend if I'm not 100% happy with it...so I'm going to use it for the next couple of weeks and decide from there whether it's worth keeping or not.

1/9/19 Update - Sending it Back
Still having issues with the battery. Went ahead and ordered the expensive Amazon charger to give them the benefit of the doubt...It kept getting hung up anywhere between 95-98% even after the light showed fully charged when using the old one. I let it get down to about 15% before I tried the new one. It took forever to charge up and show the fully charged green light. Turned it on and it's stuck at 95%. Plugged it back in and gave it another 15-20 minutes. Still at 95%. Went to their help page and did a hard reset for the second time and tried another charger. 20 minutes later I can get it up to 99% after continuously inserting and removing the USB cable. Glad I didn't get rid of my previous version Paperwhite...would love this one if the battery/charging wasn't such a dud."
Niki Abram,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded my 2016 model Paperwhite to the 10th generation 2018 model and I love it so far! It is defintely thinner and lighter, something I didnt think I would really notice until I held it and then my old Kindle for comparison. I love the screen how it no longer has that little lip that can trap dust or dirt. I mainly upgraded because I wanted the waterproofing as I love to read while taking a bath. Now I'm not worried about dropping it in the tub as much! The touchscreen does seem to have a little lag, it could just be because it's brand new and still downloading my library, so I'll give it a few days before passing full judgement on it. I've also run into a small annoyance where the book cover art is not loading for more than 3 or 4 books. When I did a search for it, the help basically just said give it a couple of days as it updates and downloads everything. Same with the battery, it may die more frequently in those first couple of days then increase in how long it lasts, so keep those in mind!"
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought new 10th generation Kindle Paperwhite as my prior Paperwhite was 5 years old and the charge port no longer worked. I loved that Kindle.
New Paperwhite is horrible. Battery lasts at best for a day, with light and WiFi off and screen powered down whenever I'm not using it (vs my old one where I'd just close the case cover). I could go WEEKS without charging the old one, and I used it nearly every day, and WiFi was on and whatever amount of light I needed. I am so disappointed in this new one. I'd send it back and upgrade, but it doesn't sound like the Oasis battery isn't any better, so what's the point. Extremely annoyed and disheartened about the need to have to charge my new Kindle Paperwhite so much. If it only had an POWER button, I think that could solve my problem.
9/15 Follow up....an Amazon tech support rep called me, I wasn't home but amazingly I can now go about 3 days without having to charge my Kindle (coincidence?) It's still not 3 weeks like it used to be on my old Paperwhite. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy my Kindle but wish it was like my old one."
twright3,4.0 out of 5 stars,"- One feature I'd love to see is control of the images that show when the device is off. There should be two additional possibilities: 1) a user supplied image; I'd put my picture and how to return the device if found or 2) the cover of the current book being read. One of the joys of carrying a physical book I'm reading is strangers make comments on the book or others by the same author. This can lead to an interesting exchange.
- The battery life is so long I tend to forget about it. It would be helpful if the ""waking up"" image showed the battery charge state.
- The display is so good in all lighting conditions, I'd love to have such a display on the back of my phone. Then I could switch to Paper White style display to use my phone in bright sunlight. I know there'd be no color but it would still be better for many tasks on the phone in certain circumstances."
Jane Dear,3.0 out of 5 stars,I thought very seriously about buying the 8 gb or 32gb because only $25 difference in price. I bought the 8 gb and found out after I received it that there is only 6 gb on it. The other 2 gb was for the reader to run. I debated about returning it and buying the 32 gb due to the False advertising!!! Don’t say it’s 8 if it’s not! I get really upset with lies! Just say it’s 6 gb! I’m still on the fence about returning it! My concern is they won’t give me my money back. At least now I know even the 32 gb is only like 28 gb after buying mine.
Junior Clouseau,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Although the product was received promptly and appeared to be of the very highest quality, I just could NOT enjoy reading from it. I have had 2 Kindle Fires and I loved them both. I (reluctantly) gave my first one away to a friend after using it for several years because it seemed to need charging more often so I bought a newer version. After using it for a while, it became apparent that the Kindle Fire just didn't have a very powerful battery since the brand new one didn't seem to hold a charge any longer than the one I had given away. So then I started researching the new Paper White and was overwhelmed with the user reviews, especially on battery life and the actual reading experience so I bought it. Upon receiving it, I was impressed with the size and quality, but the more I used it, the less I liked it. The screen is quite a bit smaller than the Kindle Fire, but I don't think that's the main reason for my disappointment since I frequently read on my phone and enjoy it on a much smaller screen. I also read a lot on my 10"" tablet while I ride a stationery bike at the gym and really like it. The problem seems to be more subtle, but the best way I can describe it is that it took one of the things I really enjoy (reading) and turned it into a job. I know that I am the exception, but I feel awkward giving a Kindle product a 3 star rating so I needed to explain why. I returned the Paper White and went back to my trusty Kindle Fire and the annoyance of charging it more often."
Jeanne,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got this yesterday.
This is my third kindle (started with the old-school keyboard model).
Same size as the regular kindle I got a couple of years ago. I got a case with a light for that one, and wasn't very happy with the light, so thought I'd upgrade to a paperwhite.
Why doesn't this come with a wall plug?

Two big drawbacks I've noticed so far:

1. When you sync the paperwhite, it doesn't download the actual books... just the titles. In order to read a book, you have to be connected to the internet to download it. (This is what I have to do when using the kindle app on my phone.) Now I have to download each of the 700+ books in my library individually. This is fine for at home, but the big benefit of a reader (for me) is to take a ton of books without taking a TON of books ... especially when I'm away from wifi.

2. When you turn a page, the whole screen blacks out before displaying the next page about 70% of the time. I know it's not critical, but it's just irritating after paying $150 for a tiny black-and-white tablet...

I do not recommend this model of kindle."
MJ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Two bad units in a row. They both had dead pixels and severe ‘dust’ or something behind the display causing starlight whith the backlight on. The display is great otherwise. But they are certainly going for quantity or quality.
Starting to regret giving up my voyage."
L.A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am addicted to tablets and have more than I can count. I carry a tablet with me in my purse everywhere I go. My tablets range from 7 inches all the way up to over 10 inches. I am a voracious reader so anytime I am waiting somewhere, I pull out my tablet to read books on my Kindle app. The only issue is that my purse gets heavy from carrying around a tablet all the time. Even with my smaller tablets, my purse often feels heavy.

I was in a doctor's office recently when I noticed a woman reading from a very small device and asked her about it. It was some version of a very small Kindle e-reader, so I decided to look on Amazon. I came across this Kindle Paperwhite and it looked to be a pretty good deal at a reasonable price for an e-reader.

I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. The first thing I noticed was that it is very lightweight. I couldn't believe how lightweight it is compared to all of my other tablets, even my smaller tablets. This device is actually lighter than my Samsung cellphone. It's also very thin. I can comfortably hold this device in one hand without it feeling too heavy. As you can see from one of the pictures above, I have already purchased a case for the device, and even with a case on it is still very light and comfortable to hold even with just one hand.

The battery life on it appears to be pretty good as well. I have downloaded over 40 books so far and I still have 20% battery life left.

This little device will be great for me to carry around to appointments now, as it will not be heavy and I can still access all of my reading materials. Another great feature is that it is waterproof. In the past I always worried about taking my tablets to read at the pool because of all the people splashing water around me. Now, I don't have to worry if my device gets splashed while I am reading in the pool.

If you are looking for a lightweight device to carry around so you can access your books no matter where you are, then you should seriously consider this little device."
Flatflo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using for nearly 2 months now and have some thoughts. I have been using ereaders for decades, including Nook and other Kindles as I am a voracious reader and due to a disability can't hold a book open or lug around tomes without pain. I hadn't realized how bulky and heavy my Kindle Fire HD 8 was until I started using this li'l sweetie.

Pros:
Lightweight: 6.4 oz. (wifi only)
Compact: 6.6” x 4.6” x 0.3”
Battery Life: I read hours each day with brightness at 12/24 and in airplane mode unless I need to download or look up word and only need to charge every couple of weeks (more precise would require a time study and who has the time for that?!)
Waterproof: Finally! I don’t have to worry when enjoying a leisurely soak in the bathtub or by the pool
Case: I struggled to find a tent-style case so I can stand it on my bed or a table and not hold in my hands (see more below in Cons) but I finally found MoKo Case Fits Kindle Paperwhite (10th Generation, 2018 Releases), Premium Vertical Flip Cover with Auto Wake/Sleep Compatible for Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 2018 E-Reader - Swirl
Library Borrowing: I can at last return titles right from my device instead of having to log into my local library’s website

Cons:
Vertical mode: Power button and charge port are on the bottom when viewing vertically, which makes using case awkward when having to power back on if I’ve stepped away or difficult to stand if charging whilst reading
Horizontal mode: No cases with a stand for horizontal viewing go right side up
Dark mode: There is an accessibility feature to invert black and white, but it is not an easy toggle as you have to hunt through many menus and then it is grainy
Port: Still micro-USB instead of USB-C

Final thoughts: My first choice these days as the hardware rocks, but software changes to make the 2018 Paperwhite more flexible for their readers w/disabilities would be greatly appreciated!"
mrcrappola,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Only giving this one star because I can’t give it negative stars. I bought this Kindle exactly one month ago, and immediately put it in a protective case. Wasted money trying to protect a device that doesn’t work to begin with. Half the time when I open the case, the device doesn’t wake up. I have to restart it, which doesn’t always work the first time I hold down the restart button. I sent it back for a refund. Usually I would request a replacement, but I just returned an Oasis that didn’t work. Amazon, get your act together and make sure your products work before releasing them. I’m here to tell you your waterproof kindles don’t work whether you use them in a wet area or not. I’m just glad this one didn’t start acting up right after the return by date like the Oasis."
shannon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This item makes for a good transition from physical book to e-reader. The e-ink screen is less distracting than trying to read on my phone or laptop. It's lightweight so you can hold it up for extended periods of time. Definitely get a case, any case, because the smooth plastic back causes worries of slipping.

Avoid the Special Offers, however. It riddles the device with adds! Your screensaver is an add, there are adds on your home screen, books start off with 1-3 adds. And there's a permanent banner at the bottom of your library even if you manage to take off the suggested book adds that takes up precious real estate in the screen.

8GB is more than sufficient for strictly books. If you need it for audiobooks *maybe* think about the upgraded storage. If you delete audiobooks after listening you may not even need the additional space."
M Tucker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got my first Paperwhite in September of 2017 and I absolutely loved it. I am a reader and it immediately became the only way I could or would enjoy my favorite form of entertainment. My son liked it so much that I got him one too.

I read outside a lot and trying to pack-up my stuff and get the ereader inside before it got too wet when the rain came was a hassle. I always worried that I might have destroyed my device. Now I don’t have to worry.

I worried about transferring all my content to the new reader. I started transferring my collections then the reader seemed to take over. Soon all my content was on my new device.

It is thinner and lighter than my old Paperwhite so it is easier to hold and it has twice the storage capacity. Amazon made the trade in offer so attractive that I just had to upgrade and I am very happy I did.

I am not so thrilled with the Audible addition but it does not really get in the way. I do not listen to my audiobooks on my Paperwhite. My Paperwhite is my book, actually my entire library. I do not expect my books to talk. I have a Fire tablet for all other forms of entertainment I require including audiobooks. I am glad all my audiobooks did not automatically download to my new Paperwhite.

I am a very satisfied Paperwhite customer!"
Rawan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The following review is primarily a comparison to the previous generation Paperwhite (Gen 3).

I've had the previous generation Paperwhite (Gen 3) for a few years now. My first impression, upon receiving this, was 'this looks nice!', but that soon subsided when I turned it on. The text was simply not as crisp and well defined as it was on the previous generation.

Of course, there's nothing wrong with it. It's still a brilliant display, especially compared to tablets and their glare. Likely, most people will not notice anything different unless placed side by side next to a previous generation Paperwhite. But for me, I placed them side-by-side, and simply being aware of this fact made my reading experience is a little less enjoyable.

My recommendation: unless you absolutely need it to be waterproof, I'd stick to Gen 3.

Main differences:

- Now has double the capacity, which I assume for most users would be inconsequential as it's quite challenging to even approach the storage limit.
- Slightly smaller, only noticeable if you put them side by side--also inconsequential.
- Now has Bluetooth for audio books--inconsequential as you could use your phone for that.
- Flush screen: a nice design change, but not a game changer--also tends to attract fingerprints more.

The only real advantage I see is it being waterproof. If you see yourself reading at the beach or around the pool, this might be of use. Else, I'm unfortunately not impressed with the update.

NB: My rating is primarily due to how this compares to the previous generation. In absolute value and without the previous generation to compare to, I would give it 5 stars. It's still a very capable device, lightweight, easy to hold, and the screen looks and feels as close to real paper books as can be. But compared to the previous generation, I would give it 3.5 stars because it feels like a step down in the important areas rather than an upgrade."
softball grammy,1.0 out of 5 stars,The only thing I like about the new kindle is that it’s lighter. It seems like every time they come up with a revised edition it gets worse because they try to make it a mini computer. And I believe in the kiss method and this new kindle has too much and is too complicated with too many changes and takes the enjoyment out of reading. I like to read to relax and I certainly don’t like having to deal with all of the changes and looking up how to do a font change and how difficult it is to download books from one kindle to the other etc. I actually went back to using my original paperwhite and had this is not been a gift I would have sent it back!
Jen,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an old Kindle generation 2. I loved that thing. It finally died, forcing me to upgrade. One of the things I loved about the gen 2 was the free 3g built in. I could buy books on the beach. I never had to worry about wifi. Imagine my surprise when I saw 4g in the specs for the new kindle paperwhite. However, this is a smoke and mirrors game that amazon is playing. This paperwhite does NOT have 4g capabilities. That is a different model, but they use the same description for both. I've called customer service because I legit thought Amazon had sent me the wrong item. I complained about the misleading advertising. I was assured it would be fixed. It hasn't. As for the device I've received. It's great. But, now it is tainted by Amazon's falsehoods. In the future, I would probably just buy a different (competitor) device and download the kindle app. Same thing right?"
P Tidwell,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The touch screen is kind of iffy at times. Intermittently, it takes two to three swipes to get mine to change pages. I haven't had it long enough to truly rate the battery life, but I charged it to 100% when I received it and after three days of reading on it 12-14 hours of reading), it was down to the 40% range. That is not quite the ""weeks"" specified in the description.

I probably didn't read the description closely enough, but mine is quite a bit smaller than I expected. It is not much larger than the typical smart phone, meaning that either the text must be configured fairly small, or the amount of text displayed on the screen is small. It isn't appreciably larger than running Kindle for iPhone and II don't find it any easier to read than any of my Kindle Fires. All in all, I would probably stick with my Fires if I ordered another reader.."
Diana Diaz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 2nd Paperwhite. I previously had the 7th generation for 3 years. I purchased this product because my older kindle's battery went bad and as I read for many hours, needed a long running device. I love the waterproof aspect since I love to read in my bath tub and don't have to worry anymore if I drop it. The size is smaller but the screen size is the same. The only thing that bugs me is the slow response. It seems like my new device is slower than my older one. I haven't tried out the Bluetooth for audible yet so I can't comment. As with both, you can read it anywhere, bright sun or dark room. People are always surprised when I show them the difference between say, a Kindle fire or laptop, and this reader. There is no comparison. Realize that you only use this device for reading and now also listening to audible books via Bluetooth headphones or speakers. The battery lasts for weeks, even with many hours of reading.
I hope they improve the touch response and add in automatic scrolling. Also, keep the ads as it only gives ads of books and as you read more books, it shows you books similar to the ones you've read. I have found many great books this way."
Bernice Weisgrau,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Hard to turn pages; does not accept e-books from e-pub as other Kindles did so cannot download any books other than
Kindle. Hard to place charger into Kindle -- this is after new charger sent to me because the first one did not work at all.
DISAPPOINTED! FRUSTRATED! AND SAD because I love my old Paper White Kindle. I HAVE RETURNED THIS ITEM."
Bre Landers,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this kindle paperwhite!! I have an issue reading on my phone and my kindle fire. Optometrists said I couldn't read on them anymore. Which doesnt work for me since I read and review books for authors. My husband bought this for me as an early Christmas gift and I couldn't love it anymore!!! The light is perfect, doesnt keep me awake after reading at night. I actually like that it's black and white vs the kindle fire color. So lightweight and slim. With the case I can take it in my purse everywhere. The battery life is CRAZY AMAZING!! I have charged it twice since I got it and it wasnt below 56% either time. I throw it on airplane mode and that battery doesnt go anywhere. He bought the case that goes with it and if I flip that over it's like an automatic bookmark and when I open it its right where I was when I closed it. My charger fit just fine and no problems."
Jen Jobart,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned several generations of Kindles. I have hundreds of Kindle books in my library. This is the worst e-reader by far. Slow to boot up. For no apparent reason, the screen sometimes hops forward or back a few pages and you're totally lost. The mechanism to change the page display is front and center in the UI and as a result I'm always inadvertently changing the font size. The GoTo menu should be there instead. Font size is set and forget but I always need the table of contents when I'm reading. I bought three of these Kindles and they all have the same issues. They will all be going back.

Amazon, if you're going to take over the publishing industry, can you at least try to have a usable product, and care just a little about reader experience?"
FakeName Jones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"* This requires wifi to set up for no good reason. All my ebooks are offline.

* Once you give it wifi access, it makes you go through a bunch of ads (subscribe to our audiobook service! Connect to twitter and linkedin! (Why!!???))

* No, Amazon, I don't want to give you my wifi password (that's the default option)

* The device automatically downloaded a bunch of books from a linked family member without asking me

I seriously had to tap through dozes of entirely useless prompts before I could actually use the device.

Honestly, the hardware seems pretty good so far, but the UX is *so bad* that it drags the entire device down to 1 star. SHAME on whichever idiot middle managers at Amazon decided this was a good idea."
DoubleH,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a new paperwhite Kindle in July. I found that it has a programming defect in the definitions. When you tap on a word for the definition it does give you the definition but does not allow you to tap on a word in the definition to get a definition for that word. I asked Kindle to give me an earlier version of the software to allow getting a definition for a word in the definition and they said they could not do this. They said they would note my request for future programing.

I am returning the new Kindle and going back to using my very old Kindle which does allow getting the definition of words in a definition. Unfortunately Kindle is only giving me an 80% refund as I am past the 30 day mark on returns.

I want to say that it is very foolish to eliminate the feature of allowing you to get the definition of a word within a definition. It makes me think that the programming was done by someone who does not read."
Momoftwo,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Adding on to the review after about 6 weeks:
THE SWITCH AT THE BOTTOM IS TERRIBLE! I am CONSTANTLY turning the thing off an on while I read. I bump it with my hand or it switches off as I turn the page off when kindle is propped up. This is a MAJOR design flaw!!!

Originally, I just wanted to compare it to the Voyage.... it is not as nice

This is bigger (lengthwise) than the Voyage although the screen is the same size. I believe it may be a bit thicker and perhaps a tiny bit heavier than the Voyage. Unbelievably, the power button is at the bottom, not inconspicuously at the back and the new button actually sticks out a bit. Annoyingly, this means that the power is constantly bumped if it is propped on a stand or bed pillows or if you like to hold it with one hand.

It is not as ergonomically designed and is a bit more uncomfortable to hold. However, the lack of a curve means there is room on the back to add a stand or a Bluetooth location/tracking device (a Tile or Nut, etc). Oddly, there is not a phone accessible “find my kindle” feature.

Which brings me to the bluetooth compatibility, for my purposes this feature is completely worthless. The Kindle will not pair with an iphone or with my car.

Perhaps most painfully disturbing is the bright piercing white of the screen. The screen is not the soft white of the Voyage or the slightly grayish color of earlier Paperwhites. It is like reading from copy paper instead of a book. To my eye, the Voyage has a slightly higher resolution. Additionally, I suspect that the screen has a slightly slower flicker (maybe that helps with the extended battery life). It is not really visible like a computer screen. I changed the settings for a black background and white type and that helped a bit. There is also an small edge around the screen

It’s awesome that it is waterproof.

I do not think this is an upgrade from the Voyage."
Lee R,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got sucked in to buying the bundle, don't do it. There are nicer and less expensive covers that do the same thing. The kindle comes with it's own cord so the 'charger' is just the wall plug and you probably have 15 of those things laying about the house.

Now, about the kindle it'self. I'm still poking around on it and working thru the navigation. It isn't as simple as the one I had. It may just be because I'm coming from a much older Paperwhite, these may have been gradual changes over time that I am just now getting since making that jump. Biggest hassle with this version is not only do you have to wait for it to 'wake' when you open the cover but you still have to swipe to open it. I mean in the world of things it's probably not that big a deal but since neither is as fast as my ancient Paperwhite it's worth noting. Seems a fancier version shouldn't be slower. The screen is crisp and clear and the lighter weight is pretty nice.

I haven't tried the blue-tooth functionality yet and I'm sure lots of other things yet. This is just a 'out of the box, had it a week' review. Will update if I find anything really cool or really bad.

UPDATE JAN 2020

After a year of having this new Kindle I really regret not hanging on to my original paper white until this was truly tested. While there are some nice features to the newer model the aggravations outweigh them. The screen is really not reactive at all. I have to hold my finger on a 'button' much longer to get it to react and I really hate that I can't sort/customize as much as I was able on the old one. If it's in your library it shows up even tho it's not downloaded to the kindle itself. Overall, there is no truly good reason to ditch the old for this thing."
Howard,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because I wanted something dedicated to reading that would be a lighter device, easier on the eyes, and with good battery life. This device has those qualities. However the screen is so small that with text at a reasonable size there is barely a part of a true page on the screen at any given time. Also the device is so slow and unresponsive. Any time you press a button on the screen you can count seconds in between the time the button is pressed and an action occurs. The user interface design is klunky. Most actions take too many clicks to make happen and commonly used actions are buried and hard to find.

I can’t imagine why it is seems so slow, unless it is just the nature of the paper white technology or they just cheaped out on the processor trying to make a few more bucks per unit. Either way I am not real happy with this device."
CJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really like the 3-month free trial to Kindle Unlimited and started downloading books. Over 1,000 selections available for free reading. My husband and I love to read. We travel frequently and always lung heavy hand back books (which have always been our preference). Found the screen easy to read. Love the ability to adjust reading size, etc. to the environment. Works great in sunlight. Dictionary and highlight features are a definite plus. Read reviews about whether the Oasis was worth the extra money. Many of the Oasis features are now in the 2019 Paperwhite. Came very close to making that upgrade, but I'm finding the Paperwhite (2019) 32GB meets all our needs. Definitely recommend it to others and would buy again. Only CON, it comes with the USB charging cable but not the wall outlet plug (available on Amazon for $19.99) I've been plugging it into the plug that came with my Galaxy S8 Plus cell phone and it works just fine. But be sure to read the charger requirements that come with the PaperWhite. They indicate the wrong wall outlet connector could damage the reader."
Steve Johnson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The new kindle is smaller and easier to carry around and read, its lighter weight. Battery life is great and it comes with a usb cord for charging but no separate charger. This is not a problem since I've got so many other chargers or I use my computer. The experimental web browser is not user friendly and cumbersome. This is a big difference from the Nook. I use my phone or PC to get Overdrive books from my library, the jump to Amazon to complete the loan is fast and easy, just a few extra steps. Open the Kindle and the book downloads just fine. I did pay extra to eliminate the ads, personal preference!"
F. Weiss,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Comparing this to my previous Voyage, which crapped out on me for no reason...
About five years have passed since the Voyage and this new Paperwhite 4, yet somehow Amazon has managed the following: 1.) worse battery life 2.) a MORE reflective screen 3.) a less-white background (less contrast) and 4.) no glow in the dark background (Not referring to the backlight. My Voyage had a slight glow to it even if the light was off. This allowed me to see the screen and controls in complete darkness, enough so that I could access menus and turn the backlight on. For the Paperwhite 4, I have to have some ambient light on to see menus if the backlight is off.)

Other than that, the Paperwhite size and shape is almost identical to the Voyage. Personally, I’m hoping for a new release that addresses the above issues and also includes the warm backlight."
Angel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the previous generation of the paperwhite before this one. I upgraded for the storage (32gb), waterproofing, and the audible feature. I believe the screen is the biggest improvement on it other than the storage. Also, the battery lasts forever unless you use the audible feature. Then it only lasts about 6 hours. I loved the fact that as soon as I turned it on, all my books and stuff was already on it ready to go. Also, the screen response on this device is a lot better than the last one. I dont have to push as hard. Amazon really out did themselves with this device. I dont see how they can top this generation of paperwhite."
Stephaniek219,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Received my Paperwhite 10 as a gift.
My Review after having just over a week...
I’m certain it’s great as far as Paperwhite Kindle is concerned. I like the readability of the size & non glare of the screen. HOWEVER.... I like my Kindle App WAAAAAAY better. The functionality is so much better (menu, ease of changing font/brightness/notes without it changing pages as I do) and the fact that the App has page curl and continuous scroll options but the actual Kindle device does not boggles my mind. The Paperwhite has technical issues changing pages, too- either skips many, doesn’t change at all or goes forward even though I tap left to go backwards.

I knew it was black & white so this didn’t factor into my rating, but it is SOOO much easier to highlight & take notes on my phone with the Kindle App - color coded & MUCH more responsive typing."
Bill M,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this device for one reason only: for the bluetooth feature and being able to wear headphones and listen to books. There is no plug in jack for corded headphones, so you have to use bluetooth. The PROBLEM? This kindle can't detect or connect to any bluetooth devices I have NONE!
I have an entire house of interconnected bluetooth devices that are all recently new but this kindle can't even detect any of them.
This piece of crap has such back technology that it can't do what a $10 device at a clearance store can do.
I spent an hour on the phone with customer service and spoke to a clueless rep who had no idea what to tell me. So she sent me another and I returned it, the next one I got, same thing, I finally got it to detect one device but it wouldn't connect to it.
If you to listen to audio books don't but this, it is a $150 piece of junk.
The touch screen, menu selections, and just normal navigation is not intuitive and you will spend many hours trying to figure out how to make it do what you want it to do, or just navigate around a book. The old push button model was in every way a far superior device, this is garbage!"
Seth Mauldin,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 8th kindle to purchase, although each previous model has been a fire. I was excited to have a dedicated reader and pounced on the great holiday sale. Sadly, this has been a complete let down. The software on the kindle paperwhite is unable to handle any load at all, and machine constantly crashes and resets itself. I first experienced this when trying to download multiple books at once. If I downloaded one book, it seemed to be able to handle it. If it tried to que up multiple books (2 or 3), it would inevitably crash and restart. I had hoped this was only a bug that surfaced when trying to download multiple titles, but unfortunately it seems that anything that registers as ""too much activity"" will cause the system to reset. I've attempted to read larger academic works that have lots of footnotes. Switching back and forth between the text and the footnotes is enough to trigger the reset. I'm hoping that I'll hear that this is indeed a bug, and that the machine is not so poorly designed as to be overwhelmed by multiple inputs. Will update review if and when this is addressed."
EB,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only reason I purchased this was to replace a 3 year old Kindle. The 3 year old Kindle had a battery that suddenly drained quickly. I looked into replacing the battery and decided to buy a replacement Kindle thru the kindness of holiday and birthday gift cards from family & friends. The battery on this does not appear to last very long but it is lasting longer that the previous Kindle.

I am disappointed Every Word Crossings was dropped for the 10th version. I was also disappointed I could not keep my very nice leather tooled cover for the previous Kindle. The current covers lack design.

My first Kindle lasted a very, very long time.

I read the newspaper daily. It used to download each morning almost automatically as soon as it connected with Wi-Fi. Now, there is an additional step."
ann marie mcclain,1.0 out of 5 stars,everyone fromteck to supervisor 's favorite thing to do i factory reset which is great for you but what about customer who has to add everything back on the kindle I have 2242 bks in 414 collections it took over 36 hrs to do it I first tried the oasis and 2 times you had me go to factory and I added stuff back then another problem and factory reset after 2nd time I sent the piece of crap back and got the kindle paperwhite and I only got it for the 32 gigs I had nothing but problems most we worked out WITHOUT factory reset the only person who didn't fall back on factory reset was a supervisor named larry h solved 3 at once and never mentioned factory reset how about teaching the tecks how to solve problem with factory which is easy for you and a pain in the ass for users Why don't you take the original kindle with the physical keyboard and make it 32 gig but have it do everything like it was still 4 gig I love my old one only got new for 32 gig it is great for a reader not a techno person
Eliana Peck,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to have a kindle fire, and I absolutely love the Paperwhite. The only suggestion I have is to keep it on “airplane mode” if you want the battery last for days."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this because reading on a tablet was giving me eyestrain. This has eased that so that is a plus. I do find myself missing color. First book I'm reading has color charts so I have to use my tablet to see them. It also doesn't have the ease of navigating that a tablet has. I love the lighting. The brighter the light the faster the battery drains. I find it hard to find the books I want to read from my library. Maybe it's the lack of color. The navigation seems kind of choppy to me. It's been awhile since I used an ereader. The last one was the kindle keyboard. I think I'll like it once I adapt to how it needs to be used. And of course the waterproof feature is why I got this particular version.UPDATED I do like it better now. Do still miss color. Wish I would have gotten the 4 G model. Sometimes I forget to load a book, get to where I'm going and can't download because no wifi."
sayed mohammed,2.0 out of 5 stars,"In this review I will talk about my experience of getting kindle if it worth or not let start from outside.
Design:
We are in 2018 and this kindle supposed to be designed with modern stylish but it wasn't, it's just a refresh for old model with few enhance from inside.
The body coated with ceramic feel paint and the quality of screen not good because it's difficult to wipe off due to fingerprint on it.
The device came with huge bezel and provide boring design from Amazon and they didn't take any care to develop the kindle since Kindle Paperwhite 1 2012 (6 years right now with same design!). The screen size small and not true 6 inches. It's 6 inches from left bottom corner to right up corner but what about length from top to bottom! it's same as mobile phone with size 5.5 inches (Samsung J7 2016). For small device it's a little bit heavy (170 g-6 once) when other manufactures like Huawei made mobile with 6.53 inches with massive 4000 mha battery size and weighted 188g only.(you got my point right).

performance: It's slow and need to be upgraded with faster CPU because you need to wait a second to open some PDF file and or transfer between documents and when you connected to internet for synchronize it takes a time to complete.Screen refresh need to be enhance especially when you zoom in and out. View angle from 45 degree look like real printed document but when you look at it from 90 degree it will look weak and brighter like mobile.

Accessories: The device priced 128$ and Amazon asked 60$ for leather case and 40$ for normal case are you kidding me that half price of kindle!.
In my opinion this Kindle paperwhite 4 need to be developed from scratch from outside design and from inside I hope Amazon add some color with new kindle to provide real valuable device for us and if you have kindle paperwhite 3 there is no much improvement here except for water proof, Bluetooth and doubled internal storage and offer 8, 32 gb inside.
Battery is good for daily usage and the consumption as follow:
6 weeks usage 1/2 hour per day
3weeks usage 1 hour per day
1.5 week usage 2 hours per day.
The latest update add battery percentage and ARABIC keyboard but it's need to improve the support for ARABIC language.
If you suffering from sensitive eyes like me I advice you to buy it it's comfortable for daily reading and you can subscribe with Amazon to read millions of books.
1 star removed for design.
1 star removed for old techincal spec.

Battery issue fast drain in 3 hours"
X. IrAal,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If it weren’t for the black-Friday price drop to sub-$100, I would not have been likely to make this purchase. I have several color tablets - all which have decent screens and adequate battery life.

The push was the idea of returning to a device that truly is meant for one thing-reading (well...and listening but, those are only audiobooks so....). The idea of having such a device with waterproof portability is still appreciated. Add the crispness of the text and font scalability and you have a great reading tool.

The addition of a responsive multi-touch screen is quite nice and I am still discovering new things (you can pinch to zoom text!)

I do wish there were an accelerometer, or method of enlarging book images directly while reading as there have been many illustrations that, while crisp, are virtually unreadable.

As long as e-paper has been around, the standard price seems a tad high for a b/w device with a small amount of storage, Bluetooth only audio books listening, special offers on the lock screen and a few LEDs thrown in for visibility in low/no light but...it all works!

Overall I am happy I purchased this e-reader.

Pros:
- Crisp text
- Fairly responsive touchscreen
- Multi-Day Battery life
- Great visibility in bright and low-light
- Waterproof/Splash-proof
- Coat pocket friendly

Cons
- costly compared to OLED devices
- OS feels extremely outdated for the price
- Occasional updates can drain your battery
- No usb C
- No charging block is included"
Barbara,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by saying this is my 5th or 6th Kindle - I forget how many I've had over the years. Always upgraded, not because of a problem. I love being able to read on the beach, I love having all my books in a lightweight, transportable format, I love being able to read in bed without room lights on. Now I have one that's blue, my favorite color. What could be wrong? I have two complaints, neither of which is a deal breaker, but I should mention them. #1 - the ""page back"" touch screen is waaaay too sensitive. I find myself going backwards instead of forward many times. and #2 - I don't like the ""waking up"" message when I turn it on. My previous Kindles were ""swipe"" to start and now I have to wait. I know it's petty but I push the on button and swipe but nothing happens. I'm sure I'll get used to it. Other than that, I love it, as I have loved all the ones who went before."
John De Treville,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually read Kindle books on my iPad or iPhone, and I’m very happy with those devices. I bought this Kindle imagining it would be better for reading in the sunlight, and because it might help keep me from being distracted by all the other things also available on those other devices.

That worked, and I’m pretty happy with it. I’m less happy to discover that it’s is not as good at some ordinary tasks. Images are much harder to read. The touch-screen is prone to mistake one tap for four or more, skipping forward that number of pages and leaving me lost. The battery also discharges very quickly some of the time.

All in all, the software is not as good as the Kindle software on the other devices. But this device is certainly good for reading in the sun, and keeps me reading for longer stretches. Was it worth the money? Maybe, because I got it for a very low price."
Douglas Rowe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just perfect, go no further. Books download quickly the text is clear and perfect. The backlighting is adjustable and can even be reveresed to white text on black page. A feature I enjoy since I frequently read when I can't sleep. The unit is light, waterproof, and a near perfect size of small enough to carry, large enough to read easily."
Sparrow,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been an ebook reader since the Nook came out, over 10 years ago. I'd remained loyal to B&N all that time, but the new waterproof Kindle convinced me to switch from my 10 year old Nook GlowLight. I feel like a traitor, but... the Kindle is really so much better! In fact, I'm having a hard time writing this review without raving about the thing! The back light is even, the design is attractive, pages turn quickly and effortlessly, the battery is superb, and it's light weight. What's most impressive though is how extremely customizable it is. I love that I can have the time at the top of the page, that I can choose whether to view book location or page number. ""Collections"" take the place of the ""book shelves"" that Nook had in its first edition but inexplicably scrapped with the glow light; they allow the reader to organize large libraries. With the help of Calibre, I can convert and move over all of the older books that I used to keep on my Nook. It is going to take me some time to learn all of the ins and outs of this thing, but I am really loving it. I look forward to learning more about the lending library (wow!) and Whispersync. Fortunately, Amazon apparently has a help section for it that will keep me happily exploring for hours."
Dakota,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got my 1st paperwhite in 2016. This one isn't faster. No new Fonts. The 1st thing you have to do is connect to wifi. The 2nd is you have to register. I chose to create a new acct. The Kindle had other ideas, it didn't like my email addresses, & don't get me started on the cap-something, (to prove you're a person) Did that 3+ times, no go.
Then I clicked ""create account"" Nope. Not happening. The keyboard is still slow to respond & annoying to type on.
I managed to turn the screen off & wrangled it back into the plastic & into the box. There's no usb plug included, I have extras so that worked. The screen is all 1 level, so if you touch the wrong spot, you'll get a pop up. That'll take some getting used to. Battery comes with some juice. I'm sure I could find out what I did wrong, maybe another time.
So I'll continue using my old one. It seems to like me better than the new one..."
ChaosMom,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Paperwhite to replace a Kindle that went missing at my mother's nursing home. I like the built in light very much, however, the battery life leaves a lot to be desired. I purchased my last Kindle E-reader in 2016 and could get a weeks worth of reading in a single charge. I purchased my Paperwhite this past Wednesday, August 7, and despite keeping the light at the lowest setting, I have had to recharge my Paperwhite every night! I am very disappointed with the lack of battery life. Under the description of the device Amazon says, "" A single battery charge lasts weeks, not hours."" (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CXG6C9W?ref_=nav_em_T1_0_4_11_2__k_ods_eink_mt). What I DO like about my new Paperwhite is that it is very light; lighter than the smaller Kindle. I also appreciate the lighting. If I were to choose to read with the lights down, I would be able to do so. I have no intention of bringing it into my tub or to the side of a pool, so waterproof doesn't matter in the least bit to me. I will keep the device instead of returning it because I trust it will still do what I need it to do the most: Allow me to read wherever and whenever I so please."
MAC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"OK. I have the original Kindle. The very first version they came out with. I have never had a lick of trouble with it. I can't even remember how old it is now. Anyway, I wanted a newer version so that it would be easier to hold and have a case that hung on to the devise. (The original cover does not hold onto the kindle very well and I was always turning pages when I didn't mean to) This version is also waterproof which will be great for the beach or pool. I only gave it 4 stars as I have not tried out the waterproof part as yet. I also have had a few times where swiping did not open the up the book. Not sure if I am doing something wrong or there is a glitch. Will keep you posted as I figure it out. All in all I am happy with the purchase so far. Also want to mention how much I love that I can read this Kindle in the dark of night and also in the bright sunshine. I wish that Apple would incorporate this option on there iPads and phones which are impossible to read in bright light."
R. Bernhardt,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There are a lot of reviews that already point out quite a few problems with this device. I'd like to just give my viewpoint as someone who hasn't used an e-reader since the first Nook.

1. This Kindle is very light and as someone with big hands, I can easily hold this device one handed without a lot of fatigue.

2. The included Bluetooth for wireless headphones for audio books is nice. I'm not usually one for audio books but that's not to say I won't try them.

3. I don't notice any issues with the backlight. It's far better than the nook which doesn't have one and beats an add-on spotlight style book light.

4. Battery life has been sufficient when I turn on airplane mode which is easy with the top control panel.

5. The water resistance is nice because I frequently leave this on the kitchen counter and I'm clumsy so spilled liquid is inevitable.

I only have three complaints:

1. Finding ebooks on the device itself is tedious with the slow eink touch screen and Amazon's Kindle store isn't well organized.

2. The screen size is about 1"" too small for what I feel would be a more comfortable compact reading display. It's not hard to read but you end up turning a lot more pages which interrupts the flow.

3. The price is pretty high for what you get. Maybe it's because eink displays are expensive but for this price I would expect a larger device."
marjorie mccracken,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the all new kindle paper white. It arrived with a power cable that wouldn't fit in the hole. It would not connect to my wifi and when customer service rebooted it, the keyboard stopped working! After about 40min with customer service trying to fix it, I decided it is definitely defective and returned it."
Cindy Peterson,3.0 out of 5 stars,I lost my old Kindle which I loved. I waited a couple of weeks so I could get the new one. I wish I had bought the old one again. My main complaint with this one is the POOR battery life. I don't use it and the battery is gone anyway. I can't believe the battery is so bad. I don't know what you did Amazon to this Kindle battery but it is terrible. I am so disappointed. Whenever I wanted to read and had my old Kindle the battery was always good even if hadn't used if for a while. On this one the battery is gone unless it is plugged in. I use my Kindle a lot and always get books from Amazon. So to have this poor product almost makes me want to change to the Nook!!!!!!! Do not buy this Kindle if you have a good one now!!!!!!!
Reddog Books,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a devoted Kindle user since the beginning, owning 5 versions over the years. Bought the paperwrite for its smaller, lighter size. Which is a big difference from the Fire I previously used. I travel a great deal and find Kindle is wonderful for bringing along several books. The paperwhite is OK for reading outdoors and I like the overall size, but.... The touch screen is terrible. No sensitivity, I have to pound on it to go to ""home"" or select a book cover. When turning a page there is a dramatic flickering that interferes with reading, and because the screen is smaller, pages need to be turned more frequently. I prefer the scrolling ability offered by the Fire. Highlighting passages of text is also a challenge because of the screen. I'm reading much less on my current vacation because the paperwhite just isn't as pleasurable as a full-featured Kindle."
Jessica,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from the PW3 to the PW4 as I am a bathtub and pool reader. The flush screen also convinced me as my dogs’ hair was always getting stuck in the edges of the PW3.

The PW4 unfortunately arrived with a lighting issue. From the bottom middle of the screen going up was one bright space of light. The bright light created two yellow shadows on each side. I kept wondering if it was normal or if I had received a defective device. I tried adapting, but it bothered me every time I got to the last few lines of text on each page. That lighting inconsistency was the only thing stopping me from loving the PW4 100%.

I finally reached out to other owners after about 2 weeks & found out the lighting was just my unit. I contacted Amazon for a replacement. The replacement’s lighting is so so much better. It does have two tiny dead pixels, but it doesn’t bother me since you can only see them on super dark book covers. I don’t feel like dealing with the exchange process again & am afraid of the issues the next PW4 might have. With the lighting issues of the first & the dead pixels of the second, I am rating this 4 stars rather than 5. I do wonder if Amazon may have rushed these out a bit too quick or maybe I am just unlucky.

Either way, everything else about the PW4 is spot on. I love the flushed screen. It is a fingerprint magnet, but to me, that’s not a big deal. I don’t regret upgrading."
kelecoo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I sold my fairly new Kindle Paperwhite to purchase the 10th gen so that I could get waterproof. More storage and Audible enabled is nice, but not what I'm really here for. When it first arrived, I have to say I was disappointed. It seemed too light, the back texture was a little smooth, almost flimsy feeling, and the front cover smudged instantly with my fingers. While I still prefer the feel of the older versions, I have come to appreciate the smoothness of the front screen. Yes, there are visible smudges on the edges, but with even the minimal backlight on, you can't see it, so it only bothers me when it's off. I had to wait a week or so before my favorite kind of cases became available for the new device, so it was frustrating waiting for the new cases, but now that I have the device in a nice case that I like, I'm happy. I haven't had a chance to test the waterproof part yet, but I'm very much looking forward to no-stress bathtub reading!! I never ran out of space on any of the old kindle versions, so extra storage now I suppose is for if you want to download a lot of audiobooks at once. I have maybe 30-50 ebooks on my kindle most of the time, with the rest in the cloud, so storage has never been an issue for me. As for the battery life, I have not experienced the issues other reviewers have. I typically keep my kindle on airplane to save battery, but with it being new and redownloading a lot of my books, I've left wifi on since I got it and haven't charged it since the day I received it, which was a week ago. My battery is still very high and I don't foresee any issues with battery charge in the future. Maybe I just got lucky or maybe the other reviewers got some lemons? Either way, I'm pretty happy with my device."
Joseph Hall,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After a few weeks of weighing the pros and cons of trading in my Voyage, I finally made the decision to upgrade. For me it really was an upgrade, as I wanted a waterproof device and the Bluetooth/Audible support was an added bonus. I never really cared for the page turn sensors on my Voyage, as I found the edges too thin and therefore a bit uncomfortable/awkward to use. The lighting on my new Paperwhite is even (unlike my Voyage which had uneven blues) and, while the glass screen has a slightly different micro-etched finish than my old Voyage (Voyage has more of a “paper” feel) the screen is equally free of glare. The 300dpi is on par; however, with the even lightening of my new Paperwhite, I’d rate the screen better than my old Voyage. Add the bonus that I don’t have to have a brief moment of panic each time one of my five children jump in the pool while I’m reading (as with my Voyage), and I absolutely LOVE this new Kindle. I also read a lot in bed at night and even though the blue lights of my Voyage don’t cause the eye strain a tablet of smartphone would cause, the light could still distract my wife when she was sleeping. The option to invert the display to white text on black background is likewise a godsend. Good work Amazon!"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an avid reader and long-time Kindle user. I still have my Kindle Keyboard and the 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Over the years, I've amassed a HUGE digital library (over 2900 ebooks), most of which I like to keep on my Kindle because I like to reread the ones that are really good. Unfortunately, my old paperwhite just couldn't hold many and would start to freeze up if I kept more than 800 books on it at any given time. I was extremely excited to hear that the new Paperwhite had up to 32gigs of storage and could hardly wait to get one. It arrived 5 days ago and I cannot say I'm impressed by any of it. From what I've found, there are 4 major issues:
1.) I've been trying to download my books since Sunday and 5 days later it's STILL downloading. Because of the sheer number of ebooks in my library, I went to the Amazon website and under my Content and Devices and did a SELECT and DELIVER TO in order to download faster, but that didn't seem to speed up the process any. It only downloads about 8-10 books at a time, then sits for nearly an hour before it downloads any more. I've tried using the sync button to get it to download faster but it tells me there's nothing new even though I know it's not anywhere near finished.
2.) Battery life on this is nowhere near as good as the original Paperwhite. I can put this one in sleep mode at night and it's dead by morning. My old one would last weeks in sleep mode. While reading, I've noticed the battery draining at about 10% every 45 minutes with the light at the halfway mark.
3.) As if all that wasn't bad enough, my new Kindle keeps restarting at random times. I can be scrolling through the pages to see what new books have downloaded since the last time I looked and will get through about 25 pages and the Kindle suddenly turns off and restarts for no apparent reason. I've also had this happen when I was in the middle of reading a book. Once the Kindle has restarted it reverts back to the main screen instead of picking up where it left off. This is HIGHLY annoying.
4.) I attempted to download one of my audible books (I have over 200) to listen to while my ebooks were downloading... I got as far as getting it put in the Download Queu, but it never did download. And when the Kindle restarted itself, the audible book had been removed from the Queu, so 5 days after receiving it I still don't know if the Audible works or not bc I haven't been able to get it to download.

All that being said, I give this 2 stars because it arrived within 2 days of ordering and because it does have more storage space... but that's all it has going for it. I feel Amazon should have tested these better before releasing them to the public. I can tell by the other reviews that I'm not alone in my disappointment. If I hadn't already given my old Paperwhite away to someone who didn't have one, I'd be returning this one. As it is, I'm just going to deal with this one and hope that the issues are simply glitches that will eventually get resolved with an update later on.

UPDATE: After my initial review, I spoke with Amazon Customer Service who advised me to press and hold the power button for exactly 40 seconds to do a hard reset of the device. This did help a little. The download speed picked up and the device only rebooted itself twice the first day. I did another hard reset after all my ebooks were downloaded, and that seems to have eliminated the reboot problem. The battery life seems to be much better if you keep the wifi, bluetooth, and backlight all turned off. However, if you have them all turned on, the battery will drain within a matter of hours. Oddly enough, the more I use the Kindle, the fewer issues I have with it. I was finally able to download some of my audible books. And I was able to sync up my wireless earbuds to it fairly easily. I've changed my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars because, despite the issues I had when I was setting it up and getting my books loaded, it seems to be working much better now and I am no longer having any problems other than the battery life. For now I just plug it up in the mornings and let it charge while I'm at work so I will have plenty of battery for my nighttime reading and/or audible."
bigsisjodi1954,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the book, being able to read it and then close the cover I bought with it, so much easier to read for people with eye problems.
Got home today and proceeded to my kindle to read one of the books in the bundle I had saved, only to have the screen tell me I have no books, saved books or anything. I was quite upset to say the least. I came home to go to Amazon to see if they could tell me what was going on. When I opened it in front of my computer, viola' there were all my books etc. I was very upset and hope this doesn't happen again.
Great product but for the latest scare on my Kindle. Thanks for a great product.
Also trying to figure out how to delete books I have already read, have not gotten that done yet. A few other things as well, but hope I will learn as I go."
printzess27,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I normally don't write reviews so quickly after receiving a product, but I wanted to help out others in a similar position.

I've owned 2 Kindles prior to this one. My first was a 2009 Kindle (later known as Kindle Keyboard) and a 2012 Paperwhite. I've loved each of those devices and felt no ""need"" to upgrade from my Paperwhite. Then I was emailed an offer to get an instant $25 credit towards purchase of a new 10th generation Paperwhite, as well as an additional 25% off. With the current special pricing for Valentine's Day, that meant I would only be spending about $50 for a new Paperwhite. Very tempting. But there were quite a number of reviews that weren't, pardon the pun, glowing. Obviously I decided to take a chance, trade in my beloved 2012 Paperwhite, and purchase this 10th Generation one. I am glad to say this was worth the risk! White both models are by no means ""clunky"", this newest model is smaller and more compact. I love that there is no bezel, the screen is flush with the entire device. No more dust particles getting stuck in the corners. The screen is also crisper, making the experience of reading even more immersive. The lighting is pretty close, but definitely more of a ""white"" appearance than the 2012 which is more of a beige color. I haven't used the Audible connectivity and that wasn't a feature that particularly interested me. I also don't plan to use it in a water setting, but it's nice to know it should be resistant if it were accidentally get exposed.
All this to say, if you're contemplating getting this device, or trading in a previous Paperwhite, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy this upgrade."
Brad W. Goodwin,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a kindle since they first came out and recently purchased the 32GB paperwhite I was very excited when I found out I would be able to download my audible books to my new reader, Imagine my surprise when I found out that I am unable to download my audible from the website directly to my kindle I have to use my computer to download these books very disappointing. I like the new flatter screen with the beveled edges also I like it being waterproof. I am also less than enthusiastic about the screen it seems to be more yellow than previous versions and is not quite as bright. There is also the matter of the download speed very slow It has taken numerous hours to download and store my current library also it takes longer to open a book than it should. I have also noticed the charge cable is hard to plug in and sometimes is difficult to disconnect., and there is the fact we were lied to about how long the charge lasts my previous Paperwhite the charge lasted a few days and with this one the charge only lasts a few hours not anywhere as good as advertised not really sure I can honestly recommend this version think long and hard is my advise"
CSpain,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't think I would ever like a Kindle, and I did not see the point until I got one. I got a refurbished Kindle Paperwhite (7th Generation) & it had a little light leak in it, so I took it back and upgraded to this one. I was pretty sad giving that the older Kindle up, but I was also anxious to get this new one, with audible.

This one is lighter with a sleeker screen. I do miss the slightly textured screen of the older paperwhite; there was something nostalgic and book like with that. This one feels more like a mini tablet, but it's smooth and responsive, and even more sensitive than my older paperwhite, almost too sensitive. But I like it and I am getting use to it.

The device can get real fingerprinty, but you only see it on the black part of the Kindle, it not a big deal. I love it though, and it's really easy on the eyes. I love how I can increase the text, highlight, save notes, look up words with the touch of a finger.

I was slightly disappointed there was no speaker on it for the Audible, but maybe that would have made it a bulkier device. It's not a deal breaker though; if anything this is a game changer.

I love everything about it that those minor issues don't outweigh the bigger picture. This kindle is a waterproof book, and you can carry your whole library of books around with you anywhere. You can read on it beautifully without the glare of the sun or bulky book light. This is the future of books. I no longer have to hoard books all over the house, this device is a fun, cute and a truly revolutionary device. I find myself comfortably reading more now than ever before. Thank you Amazon for turning me on to this."
Deacon John,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The user interface between the Fire and the remote Kindle reading app are the same. Tap in the middle of the page to bring up and set features, swipe to turn pages. The Paper White is different. It doesn't swipe well and you tap the page to turn it it. It may sound simple but tap on the middle to set book mark , oops turned the page. Tap far left to go back a page, oops not far enough. Swipe to go back, slow to resond. What page was I on? Awful, simply awful.
I complained to my daughter and she sweetly replied ""Dad the user interface on real books hasn't changed in 500 years"".
I am very disappointed in Amazon. A single interface across all devices is a basic IT principle. I assumed they were better than that.

It reads well outside but why can't other devices work outside as well?

When it's a bad experience just setting a bookmark, all other features simply don't really matter.

Overall maybe two stars."
Laura,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I enjoy the new Paperwhite. A couple things that I’m glad they added to the new version is that you can revert the text to read with a black background with white text. This makes it easier to read at night before sleeping instead of looking at a white screen. Also, of course the extra GB storage and being water proof. What I found lacking is the response. I thought a new version would have a better refresh response than the last model but it’s the same. The size change is minimal if unnoticeable at all, but just enough to make my old Paperwhite kindle cover’s ‘sleep/wake’ function not useful. I do love that the screen is flush instead of having a rim around the screen, no dust and stuff to get lodged in the seam. All in all, I enjoy it."
NataliaTA,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got this brand new 10 Gen. Kindle as a gift for my birthday.

1. Opened it and the USB charging cable provided does not fit into the slot. Quality control, anyone?
2. Every tap I make, turns the screen black and then back to white causing a delay in the action, see video. This is not only uncomfortable to the sight, but also became annoying very quickly.
3. Did some research and found out my Brand New Kindle does not have the newest software(?). Said I had to plug it and connect to wifi and it will download automatically. (How will I do that without a proper working cable?). Found a cable, plugged it, connected it to wifi..... Nothing happened. Nothing downloaded. Nothing updated.

I'm very, very disappointed. Birthday present gone wrong."
plug not,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned most generations of Kindle from the first, although never an Oasis or Voyage. They've always been pale imitations of a ""tablet"", and, frankly, the very first one was the most reliable and feature-laden one of the bunch. But I've recently replaced an erratic Paperwhite with the newest Paperwhite, and they are not improving. The touchscreen on this one is not very responsive, the device freezes regularly, and for visibility the screen needs to be turned fairly high. You can't hold the thing to read without careening unexpectedly through the gamut of page number, location, time left, etc. It has the peculiar habit of capitalizing the second word in my note if the first word contained an apostrophe. It tells me I have ""one more in the cloud"" in one of my collections - so it isn't on my device? - but I've no way to conveniently determine what title it is (there are over 630 titles in that particular collection, so a title-by-title comparison isn't feasible).
I've never been impressed with Amazon's software acumen, but I certainly hope they are doing better on hardware with their various other offerings..."
Jodi,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my first Paperwhite, 6th Gen for three years, and tried to order another older version before they're gone for good, but it died after three weeks, so I gave in and upgraded to the new 10th Gen Paperwhite thinking the extra space would be worth it. I'm constantly deleting books on my 6th Gen because the low Memory popup is almost a constant.

From first use, I noticed the screen had more of a soft, hazy Yellow Backlight than my bright White older version, and thought maybe it was me, that I would get used to it and there was a purpose behind it. It's been three weeks, I've read approximately six books, and find that I dread using the new Paperwhite. While I can't find fault with button placement or Interface setup, (it's not noticeably different from any other Kindle Paperwhite) the lack of a clear, bright Backlight defeats the purpose of purchasing a Kindle Paperwhite, (see my photo with 10th Gen on left, 6 Gen on right).

The other issue is battery life. If I never read from the Paperwhite, I suppose the battery will last for weeks or months. However, while it's marginally better than the 6 Gen when it comes to holding a charge, I still have to plug the Kindles in twice a week when alternating between two, and four times a week when using one. Going to wait until either the kinks are worked out, or a new Kindle with the same clean, bright Backlight I expect from the Paperwhite aling with better battery life is reintroduced. Option the audio, but everyone needs more reading time."
Zukpr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Kindle Oasis which I used a lot and loved. Unfortunately, it died. When I was shopping for a replacement Kindle, I considered replacing it with either a Paperwhite or an Oasis. The Oasis was going to be significantly more expensive than the Paperwhite and I suspected I wouldn't enjoy a new Oasis so much more than a Paperwhite to justify the extra cost.

The Paperwhite has the same user interface as the Oasis. it's slightly slower, but I enjoy it every bit as much. I'm glad I got the Paperwhite."
Liz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Every book I had downloaded just disappeared. I have restarted the device and verified I am looking at downloaded and sorting by recent. It is just all gone. Now I have to look thru many hundreds of books in my cloud to figure out the 30 that were downloaded and unread. At least this happened 5 days before my cruise where I will have no way of downloading books. And ""customer service"" was a joke!"
GadgeTron,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgrading from the previous generation Kindle Paperwhite I can really appreciate the uniform LED lighting, smaller form-factor, flush waterproof design and audible support. However, instead of the usual black Kindle logo, the new Paperwhite has a distracting, conspicuous white logo. The design/marketing team should have really understood that an important value proposition for Kindle is distraction-free reading, so it was a rather poor design choice or perhaps a cheap marketing ploy. I hope in the next iteration they revise this and consider a less eye-catching way to promote the Kindle. Besides this, I tend to agree with what others have already noted:

- The battery life is considerably less than previous generation due to additional LED and bluetooth hardware.
- The new Paperwhite seems to have grey-er black than the previous generation, slightly reducing text legibility.
- The included usb cable can be difficult to attach to the kindle, hopefully next iteration would have USB-C.

Overall, the new Paperwhite has some good improvements, but it doesn't really offer a significant reason to upgrade. I hope the next version of Paperwhite (2020?) will focus more on improving the reading experience without affecting text legibility and introducing distractions."
MaggieS mid Mich,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a prior Kindle Paperwhite purchased in 2012 and loved it but the fact that this version was a little lighter and somewhat waterproof had me convinced to ask for it for Christmas. So far I love it but have to admit that I'm not sure it is a HUGE improvement over my prior reader. I'm not crazy about the cover I purchased, so might need to change that up but I was spoiled with my Amazon leather cover that I had on my first Paperwhite. Still getting used to the new reader I guess."
Chad Cardinal,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice upgrade from the previous model. Speed is the same,but it feels a tad smaller and lighter in the hand. It’s minimal but noticeable especially for me. I prefer the lighter weight. The screen seems a bit warmer in color. This makes me feel like it’s not quite as bright, but it makes night reading nice. The ability to have it read aidiblebooks is a nice touch, but lacks all the features I’d expect when both the book and audible file comes from the same company. I can’t say for certain that battery life has changed, but it feels like the battery discharges a bit faster. All in all I prefer it to my old paper white. It’s a good solid upgrade."
Jerry C.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I intended to upgrade my 2015 Paperwhite to take advantage of the new waterprooof feature. However, after firing up the new model I immediately boxed it back up and returned it. The display was noticeably dimmer and more yellow than on my older model (see photo). That might be better for night reading, but I prefer the crisper white of my old model. I also found that I prefer the slight bezel around the screen. On the new model it is much easier to accidentally touch the screen and turn the page. Unless the waterproofing is a must for you, I’d suggest trying to pick up the older model."
Tootsie2,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: I was excited to get this, especially on Black Friday sale. It's lightweight, and great for reading in bed at night. Adjustable text and brightness. Fast charging. Fast downloads. I'm used to reading on my Fire so had to get used to the grayscale.

Cons: If you're used to reading on a Fire, the Paperwhite takes some getting used to. It's smaller. There is a lag when scrolling, even when not online. The touch is odd, and other than page turning, you sometimes need to use a much firmer touch. No zoom feature which is handy for looking at photos. There is an odd, faint yellowish blob on the bottom right of the screen. It charges fast, but I'm only getting a few hours of reading time, and a day of standby while in airplane mode. I wouldn't buy this again."
M. McCann,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Shame on Amazon for how this was marketed! Result: MY FASTEST RETURN EVER! With special offers means that my lock screen and my home screen were both nothing but Amazon ads. I couldn't get to my books, I couldn't see my library, after 20 minutes of fighting with the unit I started a return.

I am so disappointed in how Amazon has defaulted to the Special Offers program with no description of what that means. Especially when they show ""special offers"" below the image and its the add on products like a case, charger, etc. Really duplicitous marketing scheme! This was supposed to e a replacement for my Fire HD (one of the early generations) that is starting to have issues due to age and much usage. The Fire HD is easy to use, can get to my library with no problems. This device may be a good device but I never could get to anything other than ads!

My recommendation: Do not buy!"
R. Aufmuth,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Update:
Amazon contacted me and spoke with me about the issues. I was sent a new Paperwhite and it is brighter. So I give Amazon 5 stars on customer service!! Still kind of gray and not as white as the prior version of Paperwhite but brighter than the one I received first. Because the screen is grayer can't say it is brighter than the prior version of Paperwhite. It seems to not be so sluggish either, but is not as responsive as my older Paperwhite and definitely not as responsive as my Voyage (the best Kindle ever I feel). So i gave this a higher rating and changed the headline. I wish I could give the All New Paperwhite 5 stars but I can't because the screen seems gray, not as vibrant as the prior version.

This is my fourth Kindle and I bought this one to upgrade the Paperwhite i bought less than a year ago (one I had bought to carry in backpack for reading on lunch at work and commuting on Light Rail) because I like the no bezel feature of the new Paperwhite. Also the, fact that there is one more LED and the water resistance enticed me also.
The Paperwhite has never held a candle to the Voyage (I have a Voyage that I absolutely LOVE as it is so clear and sharp. Sucks they quit making that model and now make the odd shaped Oasis) when it comes tho brightness and sharpness. But to my chagrin, even though there is one more LED's in the All New Paperwhite, it is actually much dimmer along with the screen being grayer, not white. Maybe Amazon should change the name to Papergray? The gray reminds me of my first Kindle, the Kindle Keyboard. See my picture comparing the new to prior version. The prior generation Paperwhite is on left with the All New Paperwhite on right. Very noticeable difference when both are set to 18 (what I set my Voyage to) on brightness. I am very disappointed in the fact that the All New Paperwhite while it actually costs more is not as bright and is much duller (grayer) than the prior version. Let alone not as sharp. The other issue I have is how slow and sluggish it is. From the very moment I opened it it was slow and sluggish. With no books on it going through the setup steps it was slow and sluggish. It even froze in middle of setup and I ended up having to power down and restart. After restarting I did a reset and an update. Not a good sign. The next day I opened the lid and screen was blank. I had to Google what to do as Amazon makes support on their website extremely hard to find, let alone any way to contact Amazon. I found out I had to hold power button for about 30 seconds or so. Even after doing the reset, it is still slow and sluggish.

Another thing I noticed is how fast the battery drains. I keep wireless off and keep Bluetooth off. I charged it completely full and held power button to select turn screen off. It sat for close to 24 hours and when I opened cover and screen came up, i noticed it was at 90% charge without any use. Far worse than the prior version of Paperwhite or my Voyage.

Don't get me started about the case for it either. The Amazon case for the All New Paperwhite is not as nice and actually feels cheaper than the one for the prior version. The lid is thin (even though stiffer) and the edge is actually sharp so you cant really hold it like a book (sometimes I like to do that since flipping lid all the way around to the back makes the Kindle real thick and that gets uncomfortable after a bit) as the edge digs into your hand and starts to hurt after a short time.

Another thing I noticed is when I flip the lid around the back Good Reads or the Store will open, At first when I would put cover to back the special offer would open. I was also having issues that whenever any of my fingers are near bottom of screen but not touching it or when trying to scroll through home screen pages to look for a book the special offer would open so it forced me to have to pay to ""unsubscribe"" from it. Did not have any issues with the special offers opening that easily on the prior version of Paperwhite. And that cover costs more too. I am really disappointed in Amazon for making some improvements like no bezel (Voyage had that and I like it) and supposedly adding an LED but the quality has gone down.

I definitely will not recommend the All New Paperwhite to anyone who is considering upgrading a prior version and will show anyone who is considering buying one what I have found. If I could return this and get my money back (including what I had to pay to unsubscribe from special offers) I would. Shame on you Amazon."
Joe Mancino,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hemmed and hawed about this purchase for WAY too long. I've been reading books on my phone or tablet for a long time, and I think that the native iOS application is a fantastic way to read books. That being said, the Kindle is just plain better. If you're seriously thinking about purchasing a device just for reading books, just get this one. You probably already have a computer, a phone, and access to a library card for borrowing free books. If you're looking at Amazon with disposable income to find the best digital book reader, just get this dang Kindle."
Jesse C. Ostrander,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only read two books with my paperwhite and I am still getting used to the navigation features, as you don't use them often - usually you are reading page by page. I like it a lot compared to reading on a computer/tablet/phone. The page is very similar to graphite on paper, and I can really zen out. I also like that you aren't getting notifications for messages or apps while using it. So in those respects, I allows me to relax similarly to a book and I would say it has been worth it for me to purchase it vs using a tablet. Other good qualities: the battery lasts FOREVER - several days’ worth of hours-long reading sessions later, I still had 76% battery life. Great!
The bad and just plain weird: The button to restart/turn off screen is at the bottom. You know, where you hold it. I have pushed it on accident a few times. Why is it there? Anywhere else would have been better. Also, I have a case for it. I love the quality of the case, but if there were an elastic strap to go over your hand on the cover which then magnetically seals to the back, it would make holding it much, much easier.
I had always thought you could have no backlight on the paperwhite and just use a lamp to read. That doesn’t appear to be the case. It still has the yellow, page-look that I want when my nightstand light is on, but it’s quite blue-light if its backlight is the only light, which I do not like. Would be great if you could turn the backlight completely off, but in a pitch black room the backlight, even set to zero, is pretty bright. The black screen feature is a must, but when you turn pages it often flashes you with an all-white page, which is slightly annoying (only slightly because it does it very quickly).
The processing of this thing is abysmal; it takes several minutes to restart, but whatever. It works well for books, and after two weeks I simply restarted once because I was curious. Last, and maybe most importantly, is the navigation. Like I started out with, I am still learning, but so far it seems I can navigate in completely different ways using an android. In the app, there is a line at the bottom showing me where I am, and I can drag my place side to side to move through the book quick, and it also pins where my last place was and even asks me if I want to go back to my last place... I don’t see this on the paperwhite. I wanted to revisit the prologue and I had to open a really clunky table of contents and select the chapter and that wasn't so bad, but wait! I hadn't made note of what page I was on before so finding my place again was a bit of a nightmare, whereas it automatically does this for you on android. Seems weird the kindle e-reading has worse kindle navigation features than an android with the kindle app. I might be missing something or in need of an update though.
All in all I like it, but there are some areas it could certainly be improved on with regards to convenience of navigation and comfort of viewing/handling.

Pros: lightweight, battery life, viewing, lack of data/interruptions

Cons: lack of no backlight option, awkward power button placement, case and unit could be designed better for holding, navigation features lacking compared to android app experience, screen flicker when turning pages"
TheMox,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As you can see from all the other reviews, clearly the world is in love with the device. I am too, and for all the same reasons, but I'll focus on the reason I don't give it five stars. Probably 80% of the books I read are nonfiction, and so the features that support notetaking are important to me. I highlight things a lot, and the device lets you make notations as to why you highlighted something. Pretty cool. EXCEPT what isn't pretty cool is the usability of the on screen typing. For instance, I've found no way to get it to support the kind of on-screen ""typing"" that I'm used to from iPhones, which is the swype-ing way of creating words. Also unlike a phone, you can't ""talk"" your notes into it, which is how I do 90% of my phone ""written"" communications.

So I'm left with typing every letter of every word in my notations individually — rather antiquated in this day and age. And the on-screen keyboard is probably the Achilles tendon of the device; I find myself screaming and yelling at the device every time I try typing on it, as it gets the letters wrong, too often inserting the letter or number next to the one I intended (""fat-fingering"" if you will) or typing nothing, requiring me to press unnaturally hard to get it to type anything. This has to be a usability design issue, because I can type on the much smaller mobile phone screen and have much less trouble with it, and don't have to press down with the force that this device requires. Frustrating!

There is one handy workaround I've discovered to the device's usability issues when it comes to notating, and that is the device's ability to export all of your notes and highlighted texts passages from a book and send them as PDF and Excel file attachments to an email address. This has been a great timesaver and frustration-saver. It means I can, after reading a book or chapter of a book, receive a compiled list of all of those passages I felt were worth remembering and noting for future reference, and seeing the highlighted passages is often tickler enough to remind me of what I wanted to note, and then I can easily type out the note on the computer. It's not as handy, but it works.

Other than this, is a lot to love about it. It's very reading-focused, as opposed to being a great source of doing anything else but reading, but I bought it for reading, and it does that better than any other device I have purchased for this purpose."
Ben Ami,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I must say I am quite disappointed!
I used Kindle app on my phone and tablet and enjoyed the immersed reading experience (hearing the audiobook, while following the text highlighted on the screen).
With the new waterproof Kindle whitepaper device on sale, I was curious to give it a shot.
Right after turning on the device I bought a new book and use the audible promotion credit to download the matching audiobook. Expecting a similar or even better reading/listening experience compared with my phone (after all, this is Amazon's own device, and they have full control of the operating system), I was shocked to realize that you can either read, or listen, not both at the same time!!
I hope Amazon will fix that ASAP in the next software update ... in which case, I will update my review and give it 5 stars"
James David Reyome,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There’s not much more I need say about the Paperwhite other than...Brilliant!

I was not an early adapter to e-readers, but once I discovered the joys of reading with a Kindle I could not be without one. The new Paperwhite (a Christmas gift from my son) is my third; I have a Kindle 3 (Keyboard) and a Touch, the latter bought used. I’d still be using them but that the Keyboard eventually wore out one of the directional buttons, which was effectively a death sentence. On the Touch the bottom quarter inch of the screen started to go bad…still readable but annoying. But considering I only paid $20 for that one, I figure I got my money’s worth and then some.

Now, the Paperwhite. I did say Brilliant, didn’t I? Everything I ever wished for in an e-reader is there: razor-sharp fonts and graphics, superb and adjustable illumination, and plenty of storage space, twice that of the Keyboard or the Touch. Battery life is excellent…I read a couple of hours every day and I get two weeks plus out of a charge. The touch screen is gorgeous and responsive...and now it’s even waterproof! Not that I would ever take it too near a pool or a body of water, but I have been known to read in the loo, so I guess that’s a plus. And it all still fits in a pocket.

Just as important are that things I didn’t need (like a speaker, an mp3 player, a headphone jack, etc) are now gone. I use an e-reader to READ. If I want music or audio books, I have a Fire tablet. Oh, the Paperwhite will still do Audible and text-to-speech via Bluetooth, and I guess that’s okay. So long as it doesn’t make it that much more expensive. Bluetooth speakers and headphones are pretty ubiquitous these days.

And then there is the bottom line: the cost. Ten years ago I paid $140 for my Kindle 3 brand new, plus another $60 for the Amazon lighted case. Come 2020 and the Paperwhite was on sale for $100, and a perfectly serviceable Fintie case was another $20. An $80 savings over ten years! If that’s not progress, I don’t know what is. If you’re on the fence regarding e-readers, don’t be. Get yourself a Paperwhite, load it up, and read, read, read.

Brilliant!"
beejay4747,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish I had kept the earlier Paperwhite model that I had. I would go back to it, but I gave it to my son. For one thing, this phone was supposed to have longer battery life, which it does not. My earlier model could go a couple of weeks with normal use on one charge. This one can't go more than a couple of days, and I am sure to turn the screen off every time I exit. Another thing is that it does not sync well with my iPhone. If I'm out somewhere, say a doctor's office, and I want to read my current book, I will pull it up on the phone. Never had an issue with the last device, but this one won't sync to the most recent page read most of the time, even if I go to settings and try to manually sync it. The same thing goes if I read on my phone and then go back to the Paperwhite. Then just when I'm getting ready to throw the piece of garbage away, it starts syncing again, but not for long. I should have known. I had problems setting up this model when I first bought it. Amazon replaced it twice. That should have been a warning not to buy it."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Do not get if you are not used to a flashing screen. The E-ink flashing was something new to me. I didn’t know the kindle did that when you would do any sort of action or screen touch. I contact tech support and went through a whole process and ended up getting a replacement. When the new replacement arrived the same thing occurred and then I researched some more and found out that it’s the E-ink technology downfall. Also there is a bit of lag on the touch screen but that’s the system. When it was not flashing it the kindle was soothing to the eyes and I can see why people are attracted it. I would have loved to keep it but it was bothersome personally. Wish I knew this whole E-ink style ahead of time before buying all the fun accessories. I was going to use it for college reading.
seasong,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very sorry I traded in my old Kindle Paperwhite for this. It's slower waking up. The power cable is a bear to wrestle into the charging port (fortunately, a generic charger works fine). It's not noticeably lighter. I can only see 6 books in my library. I can't see my collections at all. I can't find my Kindle Unlimited books. It was purchased to provide access to Audiobooks as well as print books, but it won't download all Audiobooks. There's not a cover available that has a hand strap to help you hold the Kindle. I loved my old Kindle. This is frustrating."
Mitch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this book at the begging of the year to help accomplish my new years resolution of reading a book a month. So far it has been a life savor. I travel more than half the month so I am always on the road, it is great to travel with and have all the books you would ever need. I love the water proof aspect, its great to sit by the pool drink a good drink and not worry when you drop it in the water. The battery life is incredible. Ill go over half the month without thinking about charging it. All that said stop reading this and go buy the Kindle if you want another option to hauling your books around.

Please note, it is not all perfect. It is not a responsive screen, so coming from your phone, tablet/ipad you will not be impressed. Just remember you didn't buy it to use like those products, its to read a book, flip a page and make a highlight."
Kristina Limon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an older Kindle Paper White that gave up the ship. Loved it. Looked for a new one and had 3 choices at basically, $89, $129, and $249. Do not buy the $129 version. It does not include the promised wireless option. If you look at the comparison's and specs, this version comes with both wifi and wireless but after returning the first one and being assured that the problem was corrected, the second one did not have wireless either. Checked the whole writeup on wireless and it showed that the basic version does not have wireless (89), the middle (129) does have 3g wireless, the (249) has 4g. Talked to a representative and was told that I received the right one, but that 3g wireless was no longer available. I basically paid 40 more for the 89 dollar version. Told me to buy the 249 if I wanted wireless..so beware!"
Statmonkey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give this ten stars if I could.

After my original kindle died I rotated between my phone, an android pad and my PC for reading e-books. Reluctantly, I let a friend talk me into the new paper white and expected yet another device that I would have lying around collecting dust. I was so wrong. A month into using it and I rarely go anywhere without it. Admittedly I am comparing to the original kindle and various devices and not among e-book readers. I can't say that this is the best or even better than others. This is just my experience.

The Reasons:
1. Comfort of use. The size is perfect for me. It fits in a back pocket and I can take it on a hike, on the train, in house, with a mouse. It fits easily in my hand and pages can be turned with one hand.
2. Distraction free. I opted for the version with ads (special offers) because another reviewer found them unobtrusive. I would agree, the device provides a distraction free reading environment. Unlike the other formats where texts, emails, calls, etc intrude. The Kindle makes it all about what you are reading and only about what you are reading.
3. Ease of putting things on the device. Simple to put content on and take content off with more than enough storage for plenty of reading material.
4. Built in lighting, font changes, setting variations, eye comfort. Device provides all the settings one would need to create your own perfect reading ecosystem.
5. Value. Personally think this is one of the best bargains I have ever gotten. I use the device several hours daily. As I said it goes nearly everywhere with me. How often do you buy something and feel great about the decision two months later?
6. Battery life is exceptional. I never consciously worry about charging it. More often I plug it in to add a book and leave it on the charger while I do so.

I really have no negatives. If I think of any I will add them. Most importantly for me is that I would highly recommend it."
AmazonFan4Ever,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Kindle Paperwhite device. I had ordered one a year ago but wasn’t happy with it. I think I was just not used to the way it worked.

This time around I am much happier with the device. I’ve grown accustomed to the backlight and how the unit sometimes pauses briefly when it “wakes up” from an idle state.

The flush display screen is crisp and easy to view for extended periods under various ambient lighting conditions due to its adjustable backlight and wide selection of reading fonts.

The device has Audible integration built in. Just pair it with Bluetooth headphones when you want to consume content in a manner that permits you to simultaneously engage in other activities such as walking, driving etc.

Now the Kindke Paperwhite comes with a three month trial subscription of the Kindle Unlimited service which gives subscribers access to a curated collection of over one million ebook for $9.99/month. As I find myself reading more and more these days, such a service allows me to enjoy many titles without incurring great day expense. Of course, I can always purchase outright those ebooks I wish to own permanently.

I’m glad I gave this device a second try. It has delivered a great mobile reading experience for me and I look forward to many hours of reading pleasure each week with my new Kindle Paperwhite."
NTS,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Paperwhite - only it's not Paperwhite!! Compared side by side with my still functioning 7th generation it is very YELLOW! I don't care about waterproof, I don't need any added features at the expense of a dull yellow screen, the screen light is not any better than my old original Kindles! What on earth is the development team thinking to put this in production??! They should say, ""It's waterproof, but it is not a paperwhite, because the screen is now yellow, so if being waterproof is important - more important than a crisp white background, and you can be satisfied with with a dull yellow screen, then this is for you. If you expect more from Amazon, as in that a newer generation would be AT LEAST as good as those in the past, then this will not work for you. This is several steps backwards in my opinion. I am returning this poor excuse for a ""Paperwhite"" which should be called a ""YELLOWWHITE"". I can't believe more people haven't complained about this. Maybe some of the many positive reviews are from those who have never had a Paperwhite and they don't know the difference! I have been a Prime member for many years and order almost every week. I have never been so disappointed in an Amazon product! I didn't even really check the reviews (except the numbers and stars) and PICTURES before ordering this newest generation Paperwhite, because, of course, it would be just as white as all of the others! My current one has a small bright spot that is distracting, but I will deal with it until Amazon gets this under control and actually makes a new generation of PAPERWHITE! I even tried to order a new 7th generation - not available. I will also have to send back the neat slip-on edge that has an elastic band to make reading in bed and page turning easier, and also the new case I ordered. I have to go back and change my Kindle address on NetGalley for sending ARCs to me. I was so excited and now I'm just sad and disappointed."
Jay,1.0 out of 5 stars," It’s fine when I’m actually reading a book. It’s slow, very slow. You type in your password and there’s like a 3 or 4 second delay before you see what you typed which is annoying because it’s prone to errors by it’s inaccuracy when touching a number or letter. It will easily pick something right next to what you touched. I don’t really like it. I feel like I’m using decades old technology. I have a kindle fire from 2011 that looks and feels better/newer than this thing. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone."
Irene J.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not quite sure what number of Kindle this will be for me. But it is exactly what I expected. I had turned in my Oasis 1st gen for this, so that left me for about a month without a Kindle.. oh that was rough reading on my tablet.
It came with all of my books in my collections, over 1/2 way charged, so I was ready to go.
Yes, I miss my buttons a little from my Oasis, but I will quickly get over that. I love the fact that is has more storage space. The price was certainly right with the Trade-In.
At first I was thinking I wanted a 'bigger' screen, but I don't think so anymore, my hands are getting too arthritic for that, so I'm once again a happy camper.
Thanks Amazon... Long live the Kindle."
Jen B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the adjustable light screen options, it's SO nice to be able to turn all the lights out and still read on this little screen so my spouse can sleep while I read. Battery lasts over 2 weeks with me reading around 1-2 hours per day before recharging. Touch screen is fairly intuitive, swipe to turn pages takes a bit getting used to; I still miss my page turn buttons from the older Keyboard model. Waterproof, but I admit I haven't been brave enough to dunk it yet, just wiped down the screen after sticky fingers found it (haha). Only complaint is that it did NOT come with a charging cable and plug! Luckily I had kept my old Kindle keyboard plug, and only had to purchase a cable for it. Still, at this price point it NEEDS to come with a charger."
Jessica,1.0 out of 5 stars," I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite on January 28, 2020 and it arrived January 30, 2020. I will admit this is my first time purchasing a Kindle. I was so excited for this to arrive I met the mail lady at the door! Unfortunately, that excitement was short lived once I got done with the setup. All I could say is, 'what the f***'. I swear, I thought I did plenty of research before spending $130, actually far more than that because I was all-in on this tablet. I bought an expensive case for it, screen protectors, even bought rather expensive wireless earbuds to fully enjoy my kindle and audible journey! I was wrong.

My disappointment was palpable, to say the very least.

This will be my first review ever that I have attached a video (Warning: I do say “s***” in the video…). I swear this thing should have an epilepsy warning on it. I'm surprised I haven't read any reviews on this previously, (could have passed it up on accident though) even on other kindles I looked at before purchasing the paperwhite. Now, I don't have epilepsy, but I do suffer from chronic migraines. This thing made my eyes hurt so badly, not only from the awful screen resolution but from the flashing! There would be no possible way I could sit for hours and indulge on my book. I even ranted to my friend saying “My dang eyeballs hurt and I haven’t even started reading yet”. To me, that’s pretty dang sad for a tablet that is literally meant for reading. Not only does the flashing screen bother me, it seems sluggish and it’s just not what I envisioned, at all.

Because of my chronic migraines I like to read in ‘dark mode’ or ‘night mode’ whichever you prefer. Even my pc and phone is in dark mode, my pc monitor and phone both have a blue light filter so I use that as well. Simply put, I cannot tolerate looking at a screen for long periods of time without the use of those features. Since the kindle was flashing from white to black I thought maybe it was trying to sync with my kindle settings that I have on my phone. So, I switched to the dark feature and it was still doing it! I ended up google searching my problem hoping there was a fix for this issue or even if this was a fluke. Turns out, that the screen flashing is a part of it!!

“The flashing is simply a product of the way E Ink screens work. The display is composed of tiny capsules of E Ink with black and white particles that get rearranged every time the screen changes.”

The suggested fix:
“Kindles have the option in settings to turn on and off page refresh. Just go to Settings > Reading Options > Page Refresh to turn the option on and off.”

Well, guess what, “Page Refresh” was already off. Further looking into it, I was so baffled, I cannot comprehend how people can tolerate it and even more, ‘learn to live with it’.

I’m sorry; I just cannot fathom how people can read with this tablet and enjoy their experience to the fullest extent.

Needless to say I had the tablet for less than 5 hours and had already printed off my return label and packaged it back in the original packaging.

Even sadder, I had purchased 2 other tablets for my girls just days prior. A kids edition fire 8 and the fire 7. Both of the Fire tablets have amazing resolution over the kindle and neither has any screen flickering issue or feels sluggish. So, I guess I’ll be purchasing a fire tablet now.

I’m just so very disappointed. I won’t be buying another kindle in the near future, or maybe at all.

I hope this helps someone with their purchase and you don’t end up returning it the same day it was delivered like me. I appreciate the time you’ve taken to read my review! Have a great day!"
DS - SA,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked my 1st gen paper white better. Sure there’s the waterproof which is the reason I bought it, but the screen is flush with the border so it’s easily scratched now and pages are inadvertently turned if not careful. The font and pixels are a bit crisper than my other but it’s negligible. I hate the power button with a passion. It sticks out of the bottom and is so easy to press that just the weight of the Kindle in my hand will cycle the power off instantly in the middle of reading. You also can’t prop it up on a table to read because of this - it just turns off. It’s a critical design error. Have to get a case to make it work."
Nancy B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had several Kindles over the past 11 years. Each new one is better than the previous one. I have had a Paperwhite since the year they came out. After Hurricane Sandy I was happy to get the Paperwhite because we had lost our electricity for almost 3 weeks and I would go out to Starbucks every other night to charge up my earlier Kindle (which wasn’t backlit) and my laptop so that I would be able to read since the days were really long and the nights were even worse, without electricity. I read a ton of books because we were in the last section of our town to get our electric back. I had noticed, that when I read from my iPad that I could do a reverse and have a black page with white printing (see my pictures) and I enjoyed reading that better, than reading the white page with black printing. My old Paperwhite didn’t afford that choice to me. This new one has that and is also water resistant. I also ordered the twilight blue color, which isn’t necessary, because I always protect my electronics with cases. As you can see by the pictures, I have a “Library” case for my new, blue Paperwhite and with the cover on, you can’t even tell what color the Paperwhite even is!

I have way more than 150 books on my Paperwhite and Amazon makes it very helpful that when you order an updated Paperwhite, like I did, Amazon sends out the new one with all of your previous content already downloaded on it. I planned to trade in my old Paperwhite, but my daughter wanted it so I gladly, gave it to her instead. I feel that reading on the Paperwhite is like reading a book, actually, it is better than reading a book, because it is lighter in weight than holding a book and the turning of pages is much easier than the turning of pages in an actual book. I have trouble understanding when people prefer an actual book to reading on a Kindle/Paperwhite. To me, when I am reading on the Kindle/Paperwhite, I feel like I AM reading a book and this new Paperwhite does not disappoint.

What confuses me is that people who come across problems right after they get their Paperwhite or even during or right after warranty, their first step is not to contact Amazon Customer Service, directly. In my experience, Amazon has always been very helpful and any issues I have ever had were resolved in my favor and I can’t think of any other company that I can say the same about!"
JIM,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this 10th Generation Kindle as a Christmas present to replace my old 5th generation version. I enjoy reading but I also enjoy playing word games which I did on the old version. All my books are available to this new device from the Cloud. This new pad, as I come to find out however, is ONLY A READER. Only after spending nearly 3 hours on the phone with the great people at Kindle Support I came to find out that none of the games I enjoyed on my old pad are compatible with this ""new"" 10 Generation device. REALLY?? Who would make a device purporting to encompass new technology that isn’t backward compatible with older generation programs? I’m at a loss to understand this logic. Even Kindle Support wasn’t aware of this non-compatibility - they were also surprised. I AM HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED! Lastly, there doesn’t seem to be any word-game programs for the “NEW"" generation device. Mind boggling.

As a reader, it’s very nice. It’s certainly small and lightweight. I like the available cover which turns on the device when it’s opened; no more button to push to awaken it. The backlighting is great compared to my 5th generation Kindle which has a flip-out light built into the case and is powered by the Kindle battery. The touch screen is very sensitive, almost too sensitive but I’ll get used to it. The battery life is so-so; certainly not better that my old one....which I expected it to be. This new device is waterproof - great if I am less careful with it than I am with my phone or if I intend to read under water (lipstick on a pig). The dictionary function is OK, no better or worse than before, just different in design. Seems to me like change for the sake if change so it can be said it’s been ""improved "". I have found that the Typo Notification function is better...this I use more than should be required. Apparently, proof reading is a lost art.

So, all that said, I now have a new ""reader"" and an old word game device. To readers of this review: Forewarned is Forearmed. Just be aware."
David N.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated Review of 12/6/19: Now that I have used it for several weeks, I am downgrading my review by one star, because the software really is irritating and I end up on my computer or kindle for phone app in order to browse for books review recommended books. Searching for books through the kindle device itself is just too slow and cumbersome, and the software is really glitchy and awkward. As well, the battery life is terrible unless you leave it in Airplane mode. I took it on a five day trip recently, and had to recharge on the 4th day to make sure I could continue reading.
Original Review:
I really love the built in light and the appearance of the screen. The size is great, and it is comfortable to hold and read, even in bed or laying down on the couch. The layout of menus for the library is not my favorite: I guess I got spoiled by the layout and options on the kindle for iPhone app which I used for a couple of years prior to the kindle. The software is a bit sluggish as well, and it takes a beat, or two or three longer to respond to a touch or swipe than the iPhone app. Three or four times I have opened the cover and swiped on the screen to unlock the device and it has stayed locked. I ended up closing the cover, opening it again and the second time it unlocks. And a few times, even though I tap the left side to go back a page, it has turned forward to the next page. But, I am getting used to it, and it is definitely not a deal breaker. The battery seems to drain a lot faster than my prior e-reader (a Sony PRS 505) but that is probably a combination of being connected to WiFi continuously and the built in light. I haven’t had it long enough to really say how long the battery will last, but I was down to 80% after just two days, and I had actually plugged in the kindle to my computer several times to load books manually. I did turn the WiFi off for a couple of days and the battery lasted longer. Those are the main areas where the kindle was a bit short of my expectations.
Overall I am very pleased with the paperwhite. It is much easier on the eyes for reading than the iPhone and with the awesome built in light (which is adjustable in brightness) I can read in bed with out disturbing my wife. I don’t hesitate to recommend it.
A few things to keep in mind: Another issue I experienced is that not all the books I have read on my kindle for iPhone app transferred over to the kindle paperwhite but that is probably because not all of the books were purchased from Amazon. Many were freebies from authors for signing up on their websites or promotional copies / advance copies for review. It was easy enough to find instructions on how to manually transfer the books to the kindle with a usb cable or to send them to the kindle via email (my favorite method now). As well, I saved on the purchase price by allowing the “special offers” to appear on the device. I am quickly finding that my tolerance for these ads (for books) is not as high as I imagined and I will probably pay the extra “fee” to stop them. YMMV."
Nelson J. Spitler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle Fire and use it often but it was difficult to read outside because of my tinted glasses. However, the Kindle Paperwhite is just what I wanted and needed. I can read outside with ease. A great feature is the ability to invert the page to black with white letters. It really helps when reading in bright sunlight.
Bottom line, I Love It!"
Donna12,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had several kindles over the years and I have really enjoyed them. I never had the battery go from almost fully charged to 10% overnight till this latest kindle paperwhite version that I can remember. I talked to a very nice gentleman who suggested I disable WiFi (airplane mode) to save battery charge. That would prevent it from syncing with other devices or getting downloads or updates. I will probably return it for refund but will give it one more day to see if it improves. My old one still works so probably will.
Update- after recharging it earlier it seems to be holding its charge so far. I don’t see it having much difference from my earlier model except waterproof and only has WiFi and my older one is 3G and WiFi but not waterproof or Bluetooth capable."
jewel777,1.0 out of 5 stars,This kindle is not compatible with any of the kindle books I have already purchased. I just waisted money that I really could use right now. I was hoping to listen to books after my surgery but now I don't know what I am going to do during my 6 week recovery. I am very angry. Newer is now always better.
D. Dingus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I am pleased with the product. I received it without defects with the Amazon Kindle trade-in program. I owned the previous generation of Kindle Paperwhite (which I loved) and to be fair there are many aspects about this new edition that just don't stack up to it.

As for the screen, it can be quite bright (or conversely quite dark, if you enjoy using natural light) but , as others have noted, it is not the same glare free screen of the last edition. There is an unpleasant sheen when reading by a window, even with blinds drawn. I like that the screen is flat to the body but it does not have the same rough, tactile feel of the last generation which allured me to it. It was a joy to feel a texture similar to that of a book page. This new one is pretty much smooth.

The addition of Audible capability is pretty nice and navigation is smooth. It's still quite easy to navigate E-books, not many changes there. One thing I find quite unpleasant is the battery life. It's not spectacular, but not abismal either. I could leave my old Paperwhite in my car in winter and still have a charge days, if not weeks, later. This one seems to last about a week or so with heavy use, and maybe three weeks if left alone. Maybe I'm harsh because I compare it through the lens of the former model.

In summary: If you are looking for a waterproof, durable, Audible enabled E-reader with a decent battery life and massive storage capacity, then by all means this is a good choice. However, if you still have the previous edition, then I feel you are making a mistake and you may want to consider holding onto it. I know I would."
No Name,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using the keyboard Kindle (with free 3G) for years now, with really minimal complaints. Obviously it wasn't ideal that the screen wasn't backlit, but I was ok using the little built-in light on the case until it recently died, and it's very hard to obtain one of those cases now. Off the bat, I found the user interface of the home page extremely busy. I get that they want to advertise so you buy more books, but it seemed like a cluttered mess. I was able to turn some of this off under settings, which did also help not seeing ads in locked mode. However, I'm very disappointed that I can't change the lock screen anymore. It's nice to be able to customize a screen that's visible the majority of the time. This seems like such a basic thing to lock down and it's frustrating to me why they would choose to do this. At least give me some different stock options to choose from.

I do appreciate that this is waterproof, but it's absurd to me how you need to pay over $100 more if you want a Kindle with an optional blue light filter. I was looking forward to finally being able to read at night without a white light, but I very quickly realized my only ability is to lessen the brightness, which is not the same. I also thought there might be some additional options for page transitions (i.e. tap vs swipe to turn pages), but I don't see these anywhere. I've already several times accidentally turned a page just by tapping, so it would have been nice to have a swipe only option. Overall the only plus this device has over my old one is being waterproof, which isn't something I'd need on an every day basis. A lot of Kindle competitors offer these features, so it's really disappointing to see so many gaps. I'm hoping future updates could improve some of these areas."
Sarah,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to LOVE this Kindle. I’ve had the previous version for years and loved it. The only things I didn’t like were that it wasn’t waterproof and I couldn’t invert the screen colors. This new kindle seemed to promise that and more!
Finally, I was going to be able to read in bed while my partner slept peacefully next to me, unbothered by the glaring light of my electronic device! Alas, it isn’t so. Even with the colors inverted, the screen is still bright! When I invert the colors on the kindle app on my iPhone, it doesn’t shine so brightly. I believe the difference is that once I invert the colors on the kindle, I can no loner turn down the backlight. That option becomes non-existent.
The other issue with inverting the colors, which I would prefer on an everyday basis anyway, is that after you’ve been reading for a while, there is a glitch wherein the screen will start flashing between page turns. I’ve gone into the setting multiple times to ensure the refresh on page turn is turned off yet it still refreshes, which causes a quite bright white light to flash when reading in the dark on the inverted screen.
Additionally, when you turn the Kindle off, whether the screen is inverted or not, the screen flashes brightly, which is a bit frustrating when you’re about to put the kindle down and go to sleep.
Couple less significant issues, but issues nonetheless...
First, I was under the impression that the battery life of this kindle was supposed to be much better than the previous version but I have not found that to be the case.
Secondly, this new kindle takes FOREVER to “wake up.” With the previous model I couple just open my kindle case, swipe, and voila! there were my books. But with this one you hit the button, there’s a “waking up” period, and THEN you can swipe to get to your books.
Ultimately, I kept this kindle because I live on the water in a very warm climate so I am often at the pool or beach. If it wasn’t for that, I would have stuck with my tried and true kindle I had for years."
Chelsea,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle and I bought it as an investment to save money, since I buy books a lot and it's getting expensive and taking up a lot of space.

It's really, really small. I guess I should've read the dimensions first, because the screen is the same height as my phone, and only half an inch wider. I wish it were closer to the size of an actual book, as that's kind of the whole point for me. I could've downloaded the kindle app to my phone for free and it would've been almost exactly the same. The black part around the screen, if it weren't there then the screen would be bigger and much better in my opinion. There are no buttons or any use for the black frame around the screen. I would have given this 5 stars if it were just a bit bigger.

Other than the screen being too small, this kindle is great!! The touchscreen doesn't always detect when I touch it, but I just have to push harder. I thought the screen was a little glitchy, as it does this weird flashing thing sometimes when I go to a new menu, scroll down, or even turn a page. Then I read the manual and learned that it's normal for the paperwhite because of how the ink and light work.

It holds more books than I will probably ever read, and the battery life seems great (although it's still brand new so we'll see how long it lasts). I really like how easy it is to browse new books, and it was already connected with my Amazon account so it knows which kind of books I like. A pretty neat feature that I didn't expect is that if you click and hold down on a word, it will give you the definition and some other info about that word. The in-book options and controls are really cool, and a great added touch that I'd never even think I wanted.

Overall a great purchase and would buy again!!"
Terry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing. I bought it for my brother who is laid up for a while, but I will buy another one for myself. I was a little concerned it would be difficult to set up and use, but most of the part of actually using it is easy. As far as the ads, they don't interfere in anyway with using the ereader, they just show up when you first power up and don't return while using it. I'm not sure about the battery life. They talk about how long the battery lasts, but I find I'm recharging it after 4 or 5 days. Of course I spend a lot of time each day reading, and listening to Audio books. The most difficult part is using the public library. You almost have to go to the library and take one of there classes. It involves downloading a specific app in able to access the library's selection. Could be a little intimidating for some people. But overall it's pretty intuitive, and you learn quickly by just experimenting with the different buttons. I have to travel to visit my brother, who is 85, but I don't think he'll have any problems using it and sharing books with me. Be advised, e-books are not less expensive then hardcover books, and if you add the audio option they can get really expensive. But the convenience, public library access, and being able to lay in bed at night and listen to a book makes it worth it. Also, you need to use bluetooth enabled wireless headphones with this reader. I bought a $20 pair on Amazon and they work great. There is no headphone jack. I found I could not use my powerbeat pros. I looked at the KIndle Fire, it is a little bigger and does a lot of things I don't need. The battery life is better on the Paperwhite, and the display looks better. Good luck"
Frija Ásöö,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The product itself is fine for reading, but I was incredibly frustrated to discover I had to pay an extra $20 after I bought it to get the excessive advertisements removed. If you don't pay this, there will be ads everywhere. When you turn the device off, for example, it doesn't really turn ""off"" but instead displays advertisements forever. You cannot set your own wallpaper or screensaver. You are just forced to look at ads.

Additionally, I'm annoyed that the homepage is essentially just your Amazon.com page. It's not like an iPad where you have your own homepage. You cannot set your own wallpapers or anything like that. The Kindle is permanently set to Amazon.com as the homepage, and you cannot change it. Frustrating to think that I cannot set a book cover or an image as wallpaper, screensaver, etc, since this is entirely possible. Amazon instead wants to make sure you're staring at advertisements and promotions endlessly.

Last, anytime you push a button (typing, etc) there is a long and noticeable delay. I was shocked at how slow it is.

The excessive advertisements, the slow speed, and the total lack of customization makes me wish I had just bought an iPad mini instead."
Zoe S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay so I had all the Oasis generations, the kindle without backlight, and of course use my iPads often for reading.

This particular kindle would be my second favorite (only to the newest oasis) because they ppi is crisp, the use is smooth with no lag and I don’t have to keep tapping.

The light isn’t as warm as the oasis, but it’s not overwhelming either, especially if turned down. This is very important because I’ve had retina surgery and omg too much light makes it feel like my eyeballs are searing. And night reading is still pleasant even with complete darkness, though I still prefer the warmth of my oasis.

The only other thing is I’ve grown accustomed to the ease of holding the kindle oasis no matter which hand and still being able to use it (with the side buttons) while I eat or bathe so I don’t mess up the device.

These are all minor gripes. And I’d still recommend this device."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Paperwhite before that I loved for reading outdoors or traveling, it's lighter than the Kindle Fire, smaller, and you can read it in the bright sun. It went to the dentist with me, and when I stood up it slid off my lap onto the tile floor never to awaken again. My life flashed before my eyes, and after some attempts at reviving the old one, I gave up and quickly ordered another. I haven't tried the waterproof feature, although I doubt I'll try reading it in the swimming pool. At least I feel it's protected for accidental moisture exposure. I haven't had to recharge the battery yet, so can't really make a good judgment on that. It comes with a USB cord, but not the power/plug part. If you're like me, you probably have several of those lying around or auxiliary USB connections to use. My one complaint about this and most other electronic devices, is that none come with even a brief set of instructions. They all presume prior knowledge and that's just not the case. The instructions are in the unit, and if you don't know how to use it, they aren't accessible to you. I'm a person who wants and needs a paper instruction booklet that I can flip through. Reading it off a screen just doesn't do it, especially if it's on the device. You can't try out a feature without leaving the information page, and it's not easy to go back and forth. For those of us that just aren't familiar with the terminology or have access to a millennial to help, you have to access the manual on another device. Please, technology gods, make paper instructions available with the device or an add on purchase. Aside from that, I love my Kindles and use them every day."
Joycedale,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My first kindle was a fire and I had it for yrs. After it was broke I asked around and since I only used it for reading everyone said to get a paperwhite.
My husband got me one for Christmas. I prefer my fire.
I do like the screen, size, and weight of this.
However the screen is completely black and white. It might just be me but I like seeing the covers of books.
I can't use my library's ebook apps on it. My library uses Overdrive and Hoopla/Libby. A lot of the books can be borrowed from kindle but some have to be downloaded onto those apps. The only books you're getting on here is kindle.
For some reason everytime I touch the screen, such as turning the page, the screen flashes in reverse for just a second (the background becomes black and the letters white). That's very annoying, especially when I'm in the groove of reading.
The battery life isn't great. On Christmas I set it up with my amazon account (which was another nightmare all together, thank you to the customer service agent that helped me) but then didn't touch it again for 2 days because of being busy. I had put it down at 56% battery and it was completely dead when I picked it up again.
Now for setting it up. My husband bought it with the 3 month kindle unlimited. I registered it to my account but it wasn't giving me the subscription. After 20 mins chatting with cs it was discovered that the subscription can't be transferred from his account to mine. The agent made it right for me but seriously that's messed up. How many of these are bought as gifts? Why wouldn't the subscription activate with the paperwhite and not the account it was purchased from?"
Poc Network // Tech,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have come across a handful of e-reader devices over the years. Some of which have offered all sorts of neat features, but few features are more important than the right resolution and a few added bonuses, like being waterproof!

The model before this one made it to our top list of all time favorite items you could find on Amazon. This one joins it side by side for various different reasons. For one, there is nothing like being able to take your book with you no matter where you are. With this one, you could read in the shower if you wanted to. Although you likely wouldn't be doing that. Instead, it's great for pool or spa areas, or taking to the beach. Or simply having kids running around with a drink in their hand as they rush you for a hug. That literally was the ONLY thing we griped about with the last model. It was perfect, outside of not being waterproof. Well, that issue has been resolved!

With this one it has the same great screen with just the right clarity to mimic the pages of a real book. Great on the eyes and responsive to the touch.

So what makes the previous model still stand side by side is the speed of the unit. This new one seems to lag a little more and especially when you wake the screen up. The previous model didn't have to go through a ""waking up"" phase before becoming usable. However, we also notice the battery life is better. So before we assume ""oh no, they must have cut back on the hardware inside"", we have to take the battery into account and realize it isn't moving slower than the last model, it simply has a new and improved sleep function that the last model didn't. Clearly it must be hard-ware related else they would have updated the last model in a software update (right?....maybe). Either way, it is tit for tat. For the sacrifice of waiting a few extra seconds after waking the screen up, you gain a more reliable battery life.

There is a small mental learning curve when staring at the screen for some reason, if you are used to the last model. Because the screen is covered by a waterproof layer, your eyes obsess slightly on the idea that the position (or distance) of the screen is different. I don't know why it was worth mentioning, but it takes a few chapters before your eyes forget and move on. Or, maybe that is just ours that experienced this.

Of course, it has 2x the storage as well, which most consumers most likely won't even realize. We have an enormous collection of eBooks and still never ran out of space on the last model. Either way, it's nice to have the space if its needed.

The last model is still an amazing device. They simply made it better by making that amazing device waterproof. That is a the major selling point in our eyes. So go find a spa/jacuzzi somewhere to relax in, and enjoy a fun book while you do it!

C. Robinson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that there's now a waterproof version, but I hoped with a few years going by that the painful slowness would be addressed. Unfortunately, opening menus, scrolling through the library, and even turning the device on and flipping pages is still a several-second wait in between each action.

I'm guessing this is largely done to preserve battery life, but it would be nice if there was a faster-processor option where speed was selectable. I'm not expecting the device to be as fast as my phone, but even a QUARTER as fast would be an upgrade from what it is now. Let's be realistic. A ""week of battery life"" is nice, but no other device offers that so I still travel with battery chargers. I'm going to have power."
The Traveling Nanny,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a kindle since they had a keyboard. When they start having problems it is usually because I got it wet..ok a lot wet! I took advantage of the trade in of my Voyager, (who knows what they will give me but at least not in a land fill) and got the Paperwhite with 3G. I travel a lot and good to be able to download a book in any country without wifi.
Like another viewer, I read a lot and fast. This model responds quickly to page turning and great battery. People who complain about battery life either got a dud and should have replaced, or they leave wifi on. Turn it off after download and battery will last a week or two even when you read as much as me! Normal readers will get 3-4 weeks! The font works for me but if you don't like it, you can go to settings and change it!
It has the great built in light that is also adjustable.

Basically it is still a great way to read a book, especially us older folks that need a larger font than found in paperpacks.

Wifi only works for most but if you travel 3G included is a nice step up.

Since this version has more water protection, hoping I get beyond my 2 year normal!"
Lucia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't really looking to get a new Kindle, but my 5 year old Kindle white started to lag occasionally and then Prime day arrived and it seemed like the right time for change. At first when I got it out the box I didn't think there was much difference, but it really is a more comfortable read and I find the words are clearer. I find the screen is very responsive and the touch actions aren't that different from my previous model (that or they are just very intuitive). The screen extending all the way to the edge is a lot more attractive and doesn't collect fluff in the edges like my last one sometimes would. The battery is really excellent, I accidentally left wifi on when I was away for a week and only lost 10% battery (I'm pretty sure my old one would have drained). All in all I am very happy and glad I made the change!"
Emerald,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved the previous version of the Paperwhite and wouldn't have replaced it if it didn't get stolen. I mainly used the Paperwhite to read at night because reading from my phone kept me up with the blue back-light.

I just received this new version a few days ago and was excited to be able to read in a pitch black room again. I was wrong. The back light for this version is much too bright, even at the lowest setting and very blue compared to the previous version. The previous generation had a more yellowish tint to it as a few other reviewers have mentioned. Unfortunately, this is going back and I will be purchasing a refurbished version of the older model. I want to be able to read at night again without being blinded with the initial opening of the cover and not have that bright blue back-light I'm trying to avoid.

It also seems to take a lot longer to boot up from sleep than the previous version. I can also tell the battery life isn't as good as well. Just sitting by my bed for a night, the battery percentage has already decreased by a few percent. I do not think that a charge will hold as long as the previous generation (which lasted for weeks on end even with the wifi on).

Too bad, I really wanted to love this. I did like the idea of it being waterproof as I also like reading at the beach when on vacation. But I did that with the older Paperwhite with no issues, just liked the idea of the extra security if it did in fact get wet."
JJO,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Kindle because I have another Paperwhite and a Voyage and I really like them. I wanted a unit with more memory and the 32GB capacity was just too good to pass up so I traded in one of my 4GB Paperwhites and took advantage of the 25% discount offered and bought this one. I wish I could say that it is all I hoped it would be. It is not. It is slow to respond and I have experienced several crashes. The audible feature can only be used through bluetooth headphones or speakers (my old Kindle Touch has a port for standard wired headphones or speakers). I am somewhat disappointed in the screen illumination. My older Paperwhite and Voyage seem better than this one. Lastly there is the battery life issue. This Kindles battery does not last anywhere near as long as my older Touches and Paperwhites. Very disappointing. Still I will be keeping it because it has the memory I wanted.

I also own a bunch of Kindle Fires and would recommend them over this new Paperwhite. They are, I believe, a better value for the money spent. The Fires have to compete with all the other tablets out there so I think Amazon puts more effort into them."
opalj9,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the Kindle Paperwhite for reading novels. This is my third Kindle and I got it to replace my 1st generation Kindle which lasted for several years (7 - 9 years, I think) It finally lost its ability to hold a charge. I also have a Kindle Fire, but it’s heavier and can’t be used outside in sunlight. The Kindle Paperwhite is very lightweight and can be used in any lighting. I’ve used it outside near the pool and in bed with all room lights off. It’s easy to switch from black letters on a white background to white on black. Also easy to change font size. It does take a few seconds to “wake up” when I first pick up my Kindle, but not annoying to me at all. Battery charge lasts a week or more. As others have mentioned, if you turn off WiFi after downloading your book, the battery charge lasts much longer."
Tom Joyner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the new paperwhite kindle.
Jonathan An,1.0 out of 5 stars," I am ridiculously disappointed. I do not know if I received a defective kindle or not but wow. For $120, I should not have to deal with it lagging over a few seconds for me to select an option, such as downloading a sample as shown. Also, every time I go to a new screen, it flips out and kind of flickers. I was so excited to try this over the Kobo since I’ve always been an amazon supporter. I’m returning this ASAP. Disappointed since I needed this for my trip for a few days."
Chrissy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been reading books on the Kindle app on my iPad Air for many years. But I just couldn't stand my hands fatiguing from holding it up and having to stop reading due to my eyes experiencing eye strain. I finally caved in during Amazon Prime Day when Amazon was running a pretty hard to resist deal on this Paperwhite. I've been using my Kindle for a month now and I'm so glad I purchased one! No more hand fatigue or eye strain! The screen works pretty well at minimizing glare, and I'm so pleased I can read outside in the glaring sun.
In regards to the battery life that a lot of people have been getting different experiences on, I have had no issues with mine. As soon as I received it, I charged it to 100% before setup. I have only had to charge it twice since using it (about a month). It's a tiny device and I didn't expect it to last me more than a month. And I actually don't mind hooking it up to charge overnight. No biggie as it charges pretty quickly anyway.
I purchased this with the free Kindle Unlimited for 3 months, and I'm loving that I can read an endless amount of books (up to 10 at a time). And it seems like the Kindle Unlimited library gets frequent refreshes on books available. Mine is the version with Special Offers. It's pretty much the cheaper version that allows Amazon to run advertisements on books they think you may be interested in reading. It only shows up on the screen when it's asleep/right before waking up the Kindle, and on the small horizontal strip at the bottom of the home page. It was annoying at first, but now I've gotten used to it. I don't think it's worth purchasing a Paperwhite for $20 more just to get rid of the advertisements. It's essentially the same device, just with ads every now and then.
My main gripe is the built in light. I understand it is one of the main features of this device, but I feel like they could increase the brightness threshold much higher. I have to turn up the brightness all the way up to 22 just to read comfortably. (This is out of a maximum brightness level of 24.) If I wanted to go much higher, I only have 2 levels I can go up and not more. My second (minimal) gripe is the slow response of the touchscreen during scrolling on the home page or a perusing through the description of books in the library. It still feels like I'm using a 1st generation Kindle Fire (one that I used to have). But turning pages are pretty quick.

Side note:
I purchase a Moko case instead of Kindle's brand name one. And I must say that you'll want to put a case on this baby if you're anal retentive about finger prints on your device. The back is an oil and fingerprint magnet!"
Stacey D,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 2nd paperwhite and 3rd Kindle. Like many other customers, I am also VERY disappointed in the battery life. I bought my first Kindle to take on vacation since I read 6-8 hours a day and didn’t want to carry 4-6 books with me. I LOVED that I had all my books, it took up very little space and the battery lasted the full week and even much longer, even while reading MANY hours a day. When I upgraded to the Paperwhite I lost some battery time but I never had to charge it while on vacation. It lasted at LEAST A FULL WEEK and much longer. The new 10th Gen Kindle- not so much! Even with airplane mode on I wasn’t able to get through a full week and am very disappointed and not sure I’m going to keep it, although not sure what my other options are? I don’t understand why the battery life is worse now than many years ago. Also, for some reason the font size randomly adjusts so I find I have to keep going back in to adjust. I don’t know what I’m doing for that to happen so it’s hard to know how to fix or prevent?"
Neomorphus,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed.
-feels cheap and insubstantial
-poor/sluggish touch screen interface
-no color only black and white
-voice assist and ability to listen and read at same time is very awkward
-no 5g WiFi
-just use phone or pad instead - far superior!"
Just Theo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I owned the original kindle keyboard (which I miss still), then I bought the kindle paperwhite (1st gen) when it died. Loved it too all the way until I dropped it in the tub 2 years ago. I was devastated when that happened because I could not afford to replace it. For Christmas I got a gift card and was able to replace it with the waterproof one! I love that it is waterproof. I don't need to to survive a trip to the bottom of the river, but it is nice know that a very brief drop in the tub will not kill my kindle this time.

I remember people begging for features like audible and such when the first few generations came out. And honestly I do not know if my last paperwhite had the ability to hook up to bluetooth speakers to play audible or not, back when I bought it, we didn't use it unless we went on vacation. I know this one has that ability and I can't wait until my amazon earbuds get here so I can use this feature. Being a single mom, I don't get to read unless the baby is sleeping, and then I need to do dishes, laundry, feed cats, cook, clean, etc. So I am looking forward to the ear buds arriving.

But I think this is another solid home run for the kindle devices.

BTW, I use the paperwhite almost every day and I have had the wifi on since the day I bought it (this is usually a battery drain on other devices so I usually turn it off) and the kindle still has 50% battery life after a month of use. I thought the previous kindle I had had awesome battery life."
Chris Sotelo,2.0 out of 5 stars,I love my paper white so much. This is my 4th. I went for what I thought would be an upgrade but it’s really more of a pain. I was going to give my old paper white to my 85 yr old mom but it’s to advanced for her. It had a small crack In the screen so I decided to keep the new one and see how it went. I now have to wait for it to update then swipe the screen to go to my book. I did have that with my older cheaper version. I now get ads which I didn’t get before. I do not shower bath or swim with my kindle so being water proof is really not needed. 2x the space. That’s what the cloud is for. I wish I hadn’t upgraded for me it was a waste of money. I will stick with my old one. Improvement just to improve is not always better. Plus the battery life is worse than my older 4 year old Kindle
Fergus Duniho,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, the Paperwhite 4 may be the best Kindle I have ever used, but not every change has been for the good, and in some ways, my earlier Kindles and the Kindle app are superior to the Paperwhite 4. My earlier Kindles are the Kindle DX Graphite and the Kindle Touch, and I use the app on the Boyue Likebook Mars, an Android ereader with an e-ink screen. I previously wrote a much longer review that was almost double the length limit. Then, I distilled the main points of comparison into some lists, which was much shorter but too bare bones. In this review, I will try to strike a balance by focusing on the differences between these devices that are most important to me. I hope this will help you make a more informed decision about whether to get the Paperwhite 4, stick with an earlier model, or get another device.

ADVANTAGES

One of the best known differences between the Paperwhite and the Touch is that the Paperwhite has front lights. I was reluctant to get a Paperwhite in the past, because the lights could not be shut off. Thankfully, this has been fixed. I can now shut the lights completely off and use it as I would the Touch, or I can use front lights in low light conditions.

One thing I really like about the Paperwhite 4 is the control is gives over fonts. I could install custom fonts on the Kindle Touch, but it didn't work as well as it now does on the Paperwhite 4. Before I could get fonts to be recognized on the Touch, I had to restart it or type "";fc-cache"" into the search bar. With the Paperwhite 4, all I have to do is copy fonts to the /fonts/ directory on the device, and they are ready to use as soon as I open a book. On the Touch, I could not install more fonts than could be displayed on the screen at one time. To make matters worse, this space was shared with pre-installed fonts, and these included some foreign language fonts whose Latin characters looked the same. Thanks to displaying the custom fonts in a scrollable list, the Paperwhite 4 does not have this limitation on how many fonts I can install. With the Touch, it used fonts in the regular, italic, boldface, and bolditalic styles, but the Paperwhite 4 may use a font's full weight set.

I expect this is because the Paperwhite 4 allows you to increase the font's weight by up to five increments. Including the normal weight, this provides six levels of boldness. This is nice, because making fonts bolder can make them larger and more legible without increasing the font size.

I also like that the Paperwhite 4 has more gradations of font size than either the Kindle Touch or the Android Kindle app have. It has 14 font sizes, whereas the Touch and DX each have only 8, and the Android app has only 12. While I haven't had serious problems with the font sizes on the Touch, it has bothered me that the Kindle app makes a huge jump in font size between size 7 and size 8. The Paperwhite 4 does not have this problem. Making comparisons with the app on the Likebook Mars, which has the same PPI as the Paperwhite 4, the Paperwhite's size 5 is closest to the app's size 7, and the Paperwhite's size 10 is closest to the app's size 8. That means the Paperwhite 4 has four extra font sizes in the range where the app makes a huge leap in size. While I usually use the app with size 7, something slightly larger is more comfortable on the treadmill, because my eyes are further from the device. At sizes 6 and 7, the Paperwhite 4 still shows more text on the screen than the Kindle app does at size 8 on the larger Likebook Mars. But to get a larger size and a larger screen together, I end up using Moon+ Reader on the Likebook Mars. This app allows finetune setting of the font size by increments of one tenth of a point. I have been using it at a font size of 24 points, and in comparing this side-by-side with the Kindle Touch, this most approximates size 6 with a boldness level of 3. I have also used it at 28 points, which is somewhere between sizes 7 and 8 on the Paperwhite 4.

One more thing that makes fonts look better on the Paperwhite 4 than on the Touch is that it has a 300 PPI display instead of a 167 PPI display. Comparing characters in the same font, they look smoother and more like printed text than fonts do on the Touch.

Besides allowing custom fonts, the Paperwhite 4 comes with a larger selection of pre-installed fonts. In addition to Caecilia, Helvetica, and Futura, which I had on the Touch, it includes Baskerville, Bookerly, and Palatino. Of these, my favorite is Bookerly, a serif font Amazon had designed for reading books on e-ink displays. Even before getting the Paperwhite 4, I had installed it on my Kindle Touch and on my Kindle DX. The DX does not allow custom fonts, but a jailbroken one lets you change the default fonts. The Android app also comes with Bookerly, and since I cannot use it with custom fonts, I use it mainly with Bookerly.

Another thing I like about the Paperwhite 4 is how quickly it handles page turning. Pages turn instanteneously without any noticeable transition effect or animation. On the Touch, there would be a transition effect as the contents of one page blurred into the next page. In the app, I can check or uncheck the option for a page turn animation, but when I do uncheck it, I get a shifting animation. In the regular display mode of the Likebook Mars, these can be visually jarring. This can be reduced by switching to A2 mode, which makes animations smoother by being more lax in what it updates on the screen. The main side effect of using A2 mode is ghosting, which means displaying after images of what was previously on the screen. This is not so bad that it impairs legibility, but it does make the screen look uglier. The Paperwhite 4 does not show any noticable ghosting. The main problem with the app seems to be that it was designed for LCD screens on phones and tablets, not for e-ink screens. On the Likebook Mars, Moon+ Reader, which has settings to accomodate e-ink screens, can do clean, instantaneous page turns in regular mode, and in A2 mode, its ghosting is less noticable. Unfortunately, it is no good for reading Kindle books.

Something I like about both the Paperwhite 4 and the Kindle app is that they will let me mark books as read and then filter books by whether or not I have read them. When I just used a Kindle Touch, I kept track of what I hadn't finished reading yet by keeping it on the device while moving what I had read to the cloud. This did not work out as well with the Kindle app, because it would sometimes delete books on its own. Thankfully, it got the Read/Unread filters not long after I got my Likebook Mars. Now that I'm using multiple devices for reading Kindle books, having these filters makes it much easier to see only books I haven't finished reading yet in my library. Another helpful new filter is its Kindle Unlimited filter, which shows only what I have borrowed with Kindle Unlimited.

One frustration I had with my Kindle Touch is that when I would search for a book title, it would search for the search term only in the text of books, not in titles. Instead of just showing me the book I wanted to find, it would give me a list of locations where that term appeared in the book. While this would also help me find the book, I could not effectively use it without losing my place in a book. So I'm happy that the Paperwhite 4 now does titles searches. Title search results appear underneath the search bar as I'm entering text. Since most of my searches have been for book titles rather than for book content, I'm glad that search now works like this.

One new feature I noticed on the Paperwhite 4 is that it will let me change dictionaries on the fly. I also learned that the Kindle app has this same feature, though it implements it differently. The Touch does not have this feature. It lets you change the dictionary only by going to settings. The advantage of this feature is that it lets you easily use multiple dictionaries instead of with just one. I normally have The Collins English Dictionary on each of my Kindles, but now I can easily look up definitions in the Oxford Dictionary of English or the New Oxford American Dictionary. Even more significant than this, I realized that I could add translation dictionaries. With this in mind, I bought A Digital Latin Dictionary. With this, I could look up English definitions of Latin words. This is helpful, because when I have come across Latin words in the past, it was frustrating that the Kindle did not support translation from Latin.

One of the defects in the Kindle Touch that prompted me to get a Likebook Mars is that its experimental browser does not always work well with HTTPS sites. After using Cloudflare to change my own websites to HTTPS, I could no longer load them in the experimental browser on the Touch. But the Paperwhite 4 does not have this problem. My own websites that no longer work on the Touch work with it, and I've come across other websites that work on the Paperwhite 4 but not on the Kindle Touch.

This covers the main things I like about the Paperwhite 4 over the Kindle Touch and the Android app. The Paperwhite 4 and the Kindle app have many of the same features, because they both continue to get updates, but the Kindle Touch has a very different feature set, because it no longer gets updates. I have already mentioned the advantages of the Paperwhite 4 over the app. I'll briefly mention some more of its advantages over the Kindle Touch. It has twice as much storage space, its ability to display manga and comic books is less buggy, it has better support for magazines, it supports translation for more languages, it has Goodreads integration, it has Word Wise, and it has IPX8 waterproofing.

DISADVANTAGES & SOME COMPENSATING FEATURES

Although it has front lights, it has no warm front lights. Warm lighting has less blue light in it, which makes it more suitable for reading at night, as blue light can reset circadian rhythms and cause sleep loss. The one feature it has to make up for this is its inverted display mode, which shows white text on a black screen. This helps absorb more of the light from the front lights, and it makes nighttime reading more comfortable. In this mode, the lights cannot be shut completely off. But they will still go off if you put the device to sleep.

One difference between the Kindle Touch and the Paperwhite 4 is in how they support audio. I prefer to have speakers and an audio port, which is what the Touch has, to having audio support only through Bluetooth. I already have earphones and speakers that I can plug into an audio port, but I have no Bluetooth audio equipment, nor do I have any interest in getting any. But this difference is not too important to me, because I have little interest in audio books, and the Kindle app supports audio books better. In the app, I can read along to a book while listening to it being read. As the text is read, it highlights the word being read, and when it gets to the end of a page, it automatically turns it. Used in combination with Word Wise, I can see definitions of unfamiliar words without needing to pause the audio to look them up. On both the Touch and the Paperwhite 4, there is no integration of written books with audio books. You can read the book or listen to the audio, but you cannot do both at the same time.

In comparison to my dedicated Kindles, the Likebook Mars has much better support for audio. It has both an audio port and Bluetooth audio, though I use only the former. As an Android device, I can use it to stream music or play MP3s while I read. Unlike the Touch, which can also play MP3s, it can run apps that organize them and let me select specific albums to play. Also, the 128GB micro SDXC card I placed into it provides much more storage space for music.

I prefer to read books without any auto-hyphenation of words that won't fit at the end of a line, which is how the Kindle Touch works. While auto-hyphenation does have the advantage of fitting more text on the screen, I prefer no hyphenation, because splitting a word between two lines sometimes makes it harder to quickly see what the word is, which slows down my reading. Unfortunately, the Paperwhite 4 and the Kindle app both auto-hyphenate words too long for the end of a line. It would be fine to include auto-hyphenation for those who want it as long as those who don't want it could turn it off, but there is no option for that. I see more hyphenation on the Paperwhite 4, probably because it has a smaller screen than the Likebook Mars.

On the Paperwhite 4, footnote superscripts are smaller than they are on the Kindle Touch. This makes them smaller targets, which results in me missing them more frequently. When it shows the body of the footnote, it shows the first paragraph of the footnote in a special box that may appear along with the text, giving some context to the footnote, though usually this box is the same size as the screen even when what it displays could fit in a smaller box. In case of footnotes with multiple paragraphs, this box includes a link to the footnotes section, though it usually gives no indication as to whether there are more paragraphs. So, I usually go to the footnotes section anyway to see if there is more to the footnote. This is frustrating, because it adds an extra step to seeing a footnote. I prefer how the Kindle Touch handles footnotes, which is to go directly to the footnote section without requiring an extra step.

The Kindle Touch let me run Active Content. These were like apps but designed specifically to run on Kindles. They include things like weather, a checklist, a note pad, a utility kit with a calendar, and some games. Thanks to now having my rooted Nook Simple Touch and my Likebook Mars, which are both e-ink devices I can run Android apps on, having active content is no longer as critical, though it is still nice to have. Unlike the Kindle Touch and some earlier Paperwhites, the Paperwhite 4 does not support Active Content.

The experimental browser is not very good. It scores 0% on css3test.com and 152 out of 555 on html5test.com. It displays Wikipedia pages poorly even though Kindle books let you look up terms on Wikipedia. When a Wikipedia article has many references, it lists them in two columns, and this browser tries to fit the whole rest of the article into the first column. Its saving grace is Article Mode, which will let you view a Wikipedia article or any other article in a single column with a clear, legible serif font. But in general, it is not nearly as good as Chrome or Firefox on an Android device. The Likebook Mars has the advantage of being able to run these and other browsers.

One frustration with both the Kindle Touch and the Paperwhite 4 is that the virtual keyboard has no cursor keys. This makes it hard to position the cursor when I want to edit text. With the Likebook Mars, I can get full cursor keys with Hacker's Keyboard.

One thing I like about my Kindle DX is that it will auto-rotate the display to match how I'm holding it. Apparently, the Oasis 3 also has this feature. But the Kindle Touch, Paperwhite 4, and Likebook Mars all lack it. The two 6 inch Kindles let me manually select between portrait and landscape. An app I run on the Likebook Mars lets me choose from these and their reverse orientations. Reverse portrait lets me more easily hold the case with my left hand, and it would be nice to have the same option on the Paperwhite 4, since it fits in the case I got for it only one way.

Another thing I like about my Kindle DX is how it tends to show large images, so that I rarely have to zoom anything. But on the Paperwhite 4, the Kindle Touch and the Kindle app, too many images appear smaller than they should and require zooming. This is not because the DX is larger. Even proportional to the screen, images on the Paperwhite 4 and the others appear smaller than they do on the DX. In some books, particularly the Graphic Guide Introducing series available on Prime Reading and Kindle Unlimited, many of the pictures show up very tiny and need to be zoomed. Worse than that, some images that appear very tiny cannot be zoomed, and those that can be zoomed sometimes have the x for exiting the zoomed image blocking part of the text in the image. I have read several books in this series using the Kindle DX, and images in these books always show up full size on the DX, so that there is no need to zoom them. If not for this issue, I expect these books could be read on the Paperwhite 4.

Unlike the app, the Paperwhite 4 and Kindle Touch cannot display magazine pages as they would appear in the magazine. This is probably because it didn't make much sense to give this ability to a device that displays in black and white and is much smaller than the typical magazine page. In compensation, though, these devices provide better navigation of magazines, and they more easily spare you from seeing magazine ads. They let you read magazine articles in text mode, which does include images. The Paperwhite 4 does not let you use custom fonts when viewing magazine articles, though the Kindle Touch does.

One last thing is that the Paperwhite 4 is not the ideal size for some types of content. Manga will look better on a device that is closer to the size of actual manga, such as the 7.8 inch Likebook Mars. PDFs, books with special formatting, such as the Dummies books, and books with wide tables will look better on a larger device, such as the 9.7 inch Kindle DX or a large Android ereader. Magazines and color comics may look better on an LCD tablet, since they use color and are normally larger than the 6 inch screen of the Paperwhite 4.

PAPERWHITE 4 VS THE BASIC KINDLE AND THE OASIS 3

I do not have either of these devices, but their firmware is very similar, and they mainly have a few hardware differences. The main advantage of the Paperwhite 4 over the Basic Kindle is that it has a higher PPI. Seeing how much smoother and cleaner text looks on the Paperwhite 4 than on the Kindle Touch, which has a lower PPI, I consider this a good reason for preferring the Paperwhite 4 to the Basic Kindle. The Oasis 3 has multiple advantages over the Paperwhite 4. It is larger, has auto-rotate, and provides warm lighting. The main advantage of the Paperwhite 4 over the Oasis 3 is that its flat design is better suited for laying flat on a surface, and this comes in handy when I want to read on the treadmill or exercise bike or use a tablet pillow in bed. It also makes it easier to use it with a case. I bought a third-party case for my Paperwhite 4 with a vertical strap on the inside front cover. This makes it easier to hold onto. To hold it more comfortably, I sometimes slip underneath its vertical strap a looped strap for anchoring resistance bands to a closed door, then slip one hand through its loop.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the Paperwhite 4 is a great ereader, though it is not as good as an ereader could get, and it is not ideal for every use. I do not recommend it for audio books, manga, comic books, books with many footnotes, books with many illustrations, books with special formatting, or books with wide tables. But for books that are mainly free-flowing text, it's a great choice. It would make a good first ereader, and even if you get another ereader for content it doesn't handle so well, it's a good one to have around for regular books. The 6 inch size is comfortable for reading, and it makes it more portable than larger ereaders."
Laura Moreno,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros and cons for me:
I really wanted to love this thing because based on the reviews it seems like people do love it, however I do have more cons than pros, so I'm going to start with those.

CONS:
1. It's so small! Am I the only one who thinks this??
2. The power bottom being on the bottom of the device. You can't lean it up again something to read hands-free because it will turn off one it hits the table. I just don't see why they would have ended up with the bottom as the best place for it.
3. Why is it that when you click on something (other than turning the page), that the device does a flash of inverted color? seems like something that should have been worked out prior to distribution. I know this isn't specific to my Paperwhite because I bought one and thought it was defective because of this, so Amazon sent me a new one. My second one is just the same so now I know that it's a device thing and not specific to my device alone.

PROS:
I can read in the sun.

That is all.. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
Titus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simply feels improved love that the screen is level to tablet
Feels higher quality I love it!"
Clark,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like most everything about this ""All New Kindle Paperwhite.""
It is light, easy to read, and can hold a ton of books even with only the 8G.
From the home screen two paths exist to switch background color.
First one can select; Settings, All Settings, Accessibility, Invert Black and White.
Or
Select the three vertical dots in the upper right corner, Settings, Accessibility, Invert Black and White.
When reading, tap the top of the screen first.
Also one can select to view the clock while reading.
To accomplish this task, while viewing the text of your book,
Tap the top of the page,
Then tap “Page Display”
Then tap, “Font & Page Settings”,
Then tap, “Reading”
Now you will see the option to “Show Clock While Reading!”
I think someone loves a search and thinks everyone else loves spending their time searching as well!

It would be nice if there was a sync option that set all personally owned Kindle's to the same book one is currently reading, but only as an option and not as a set event that occurs when sync is selected.

I would now like to see a Kindle fire 7"" as light as the 7"" Kindle Paperwhite, it may then become a preferred choice."
MotherIrish,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cried when my very old original with keyboard Kindle froze and could not be revived.. So my husband said just get a paper white and be done with it.. I hate learning new electronics but did buy it. I love it! Now I do not have to go to another room when I awake in the middle of the night: I get to stay snuggled as I do not need to turn on a light to read. I like the ease of adjusting the font. I find it more searchable especially the Bible. The light brightness control is a great feature. Now I can also read at night in the car. Love, love, love this kindle"
MidnightRunner,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am updating this review after Amazon reached out to me and provided some helpful info related to my original review (also 2 stars). It was nice to see they care about improving the user experience by proactively offering support. They pointed out how to display the library listing as a grid which would help, but there are still only six titles displayed on the grid, which is the same as in the list format. Since there really is no scrolling on this device, it would be nice to have more titles shown per page.

The biggest weakness of the user interface is the library, and how titles are sorted, organized and displayed. I have several periodicals from Audible, which have cluttered the library to the point of unusability, even the filter options don't don't help much since Audible titles are lumped in together, books periodicals, whatever (which means I have over 400 titles in Audible and no good way to filter the periodicals to cut down on the pages I need to scroll through at about 1-2 seconds for each page). Ideally the library would place these periodicals into a folder (like one for NYT, one for the Post, etc). More sorting options withing Audible titles would also be helpful.

I bought this to listen to my audible books and also have an e-reader, so half the functionality is degraded since I am not spending several minutes to locate something to listen to with Audible, when it takes just a few seconds on my phone.

I have also found the touchscreen to be difficult sometimes. It can sometimes seem to take a bit longer for taps to register so I may end up with a search box when trying to access the menu.

It is not all bad news though, the battery life on this is amazing. I think it had sat unused for several weeks and when I picked it up the other day it had about 50% battery left. The screen is also really easy on the eyes and the front light works well in low light without being too bright, it just sort'a glows. The screen performance is slow, but I think that goes for e-ink in general so nothing knocked there - but it does mean that the UI should be better optimized for the slow refresh since every click means waiting a second for the screen to refresh. The fewer clicks to get to say, my audible library and then maybe one click to sort, would help a lot.

I am hoping that there will be some software updates to this device which will make it worth using for Audible, but until then I think 2 stars is fair. Honestly, I have found that I prefer old school paper books to e-readers simply due to the slowness of the screen refresh, which is not a problem when reading, but is a problem with finding something to read (or listen to)."
M.M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am loving my Paper White! I bought it to read on the beach. This is my first Kindle, so I didn't experience the battery life of other devices - I haven't had any problem with battery life, though I turned off the Bluetooth just in case. I haven't used it to listen to audio books yet, but I listen to a lot of them, so I am happy that it has this feature. About the on off switch being on the bottom that some people complained about, if you have a case (hard plastic one with a pretty design for ten bucks works great) you don't have to worry about it because the case covers enough of the button so you won't inadvertently touch it. Also, when you close the flap, it puts the device to sleep and then it eventually turns off, so you rarely use the on/off button. Why didn't I buy one of these long ago?The prime day deal brought the price down to 85 dollars."
Jqbuckley,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for my grandson for his birthday. He absolutely loves it. He is able to get some of his college textbooks on his kindle which makes it easier for him to study where ever he is. He was never a really big reader but he is reading everyday now. It is easy to use and because we kept it attached to our amazon account I can easily buy him books and send it to his kindle. He loves the light which allows him to read in the dark without bothering his roommate. He also takes it with him to the gym so he can listen to audible books while on the treadmill. It is extremely user friendly, allows one to adjust font size and style and to adjust the light to the environment. He can also borrow books from his library at school and"
Liazard,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Well it's a Kindle - you can read on it. However I was very much hoping this one would be the ultimate, new gold-standard Kindle with its new features, BUT the battery life is not great (maybe a week reading less than an hour a day), and the display really is substandard. Compared to my four-year-old Kindle Voyage (discontinued now), the battery life is about the same (and declining battery life was the reason I was wanting to replace the Voyage). The display, even at the highest light setting, is grayish and and the text is not very sharp; lighting is uneven and blotchy especially in the lower right of the screen, and overall is nowhere near as bright or white as the Voyage. I'm returning the 2018 Paperwhite and waiting until Amazon can produce one that's ready for primetime. This version obviously isn't. Very disappointed that this 2018 Kindle was billed as the latest and greatest. The light and display are really lacking. Suggestion for Amazon: focus on the important stuff like the light, display and battery - nobody really cares how thin it is."
Sandra,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an avid Kindle Fire user, but the last one I got just didn't function well for reading. It hurt my eyes. So this year I gave myself this Paperwhite for Christmas. I was shocked at the size. I can read the description, but seeing it and holding it was something else. I'm not used to it, but I love it. It's perfect. It goes in my purse like a dream. I haven't noticed any of the problems with the back light that others mentioned. It doesn't respond as fast as my Fire, but it's fine. Just have to get used to it. Turning the page is a tap of the finger. I'm still playing with it and learning all the ins and outs, but I'm happy with it and hope this purchase will get me back to reading."
May95020,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded one of my Kindle Paperwhites in for the new waterproof one. I have several different homes I split my time between and I find it easier to leave one at each home.
I am a huge Paperwhite fan and wanted the waterproof one for reading by the pool. I'm disappointed in it to be honest.
CONS
-One disappointment is that the touch screen isn't nearly as responsive as the one on my old Paperwhite. I have to tap several times to turn the page. To access the menu, it's a wild goose chase.
-The battery does NOT last as long as my last Paperwhite.
-But the worst thing about it is that it constantly loses my place in the book. This is even if I set it down just to answer the door or get a glass of water. I have to keep track of the location or spend ages trying to find my place. That never happened with my old Paperwhite.
-It takes much longer to wake up or turn on. Maybe this is a minor thing but it's irritating.
-I also bought one for my daughter as a gift. Each time she tapped it to turn the page it flashed a very bright light. Be assured that if you get one that does this, it is NOT normal. I returned that particular Paperwhite. The new one does not flash. My daughter didn't know it wasn't normal and ended up with a terrible headache. Not good for a pregnant woman.
-It takes much longer to wake up or turn on than the previous model.

PROS
It does seem to download books faster than the previous model.
- it is noticably lighter than the previous model.
-It is smaller in size.

I can't speak to the waterproofness as I have not gotten it wet.
All in all, I wish I hadn't traded in my old Paperwhite. It was truly a gem.
I still highly recommend the Paperwhite. I've had every Kindle they made up to the Paperwhite waterproof and I'm more in love with Kindle than ever, just not the new model."
Good Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery on my older model was acting a big strange so I upgraded. Frankly, as with many electronic devices, newer is not that much better...if at all.
This model seems to have a shorter battery life than my older (5 years old?) model...and also it takes time to wake up when you first open the (bought separate) cover. The older one was instant when I opened.
I'd say to buy it when you need it but if you have any generation of PW this is not a real upgrade worth buying for upgrade alone."
Shawn,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd Kindle, 2nd paperwhite. It feels the same as my old one but the battery life is horrible in comparison. My old paperwhite would stay charged for months at a time. I have found after you've downloaded your book place is on airplane mode, this helps the battery life some. I don't have the heart to get it wet (this is the reason for the new one, I dropped my last one in the late). I would love to hear if anyone else has truly submerged in water and it really works."
MJones22,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm VERY DISPLEASED with the USB connection fiasco! Have read that defective charging cords that don't plug into the device are a HUGE, widespread problem. Amazon notes in their set-up information that ""a small number of customers have a problem with the USB cord."" I doubt the number is small. Why? Because the free replacement cord they offer is out of stock and ""we don't know when or if this item will be available again."" Really Amazon?? You knowingly send out defective devices without an applicable remedy for the problem? Not a happy customer!"
Read2Relax,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking forward to getting a new Kindle and traded in my old keyboard Kindle that I loved to death-- literally. Thought Amazon's Kindle trade in program was a good deal: send in a dead Kindle, get 25% off a new one. It would be except not so sure this new Kindle can hold a candle to my old reliable one. Within 20 minutes, the new Kindle's screen froze while just reading. Took awhile for it to reboot. I'm on my second book and both books loaded with highlights already underlined . . . so is this a glitch or what? Not impressed with Touchscreen technology and disappointed that it can't read to me like my old Kindle did-- need to have Bluetooth speakers or headphones."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this kindle! Highly recommend it! I have a 1st gen kindle that I am unable to access many newer formatted books on. It just won’t download my library in many instances. I liked the long battery life and non glare screen so gave in and bought this paper white as a replacement. I own 3 other fire models as well.
I can go weeks on a battery charge as I read in cycles and when able. This is always ready for me when I am. It also charges super fast. It also lasts when I am binge reading through several books. I really have not used the waterproof feature but it’s nice to know it’s there. Very light & portable. Easy to use with one hand.
I can’t say enough about it. Love it love it love it!"
W. Hoffman,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing was misleading!! The description page basically said that the 32gb came with free 4g (cellular internet for purchases, downloads) but mine didn’t. I couldn’t figure out how to activate the cellular, and finally figured out it was misleading and the 32gb doesn’t come with it. You have to buy it as a separate 4g internet model. Why do they even mention it on the freaking page with the other ones if you can’t even select it to order on that page. You’ve gotta look specifically for the page with the cellular and that only comes in 32gb. I’m frustrated. I wouldn’t have bought the larger size just for the larger size ( 8gb was plenty). I wanted the cellular connectivity if I wasn’t near WiFi (like out in the woods).

I wish I didn’t feel tricked"
Just Me,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My older Kindle is 2 year old and it's wonderful. I upgraded for the waterproof aspect, but I'm truly sorry I did. Mine keeps giving me a message about low power and then it shuts down. It happens when it's just come off the charger and has power in the 90% range, in the 70% range, in other words when there's no reason for it to shut down on me. If you have an older Kindle stay with it.

Just a side note, this one is also really 'slick' and the power button is so touchy that just touching it gently with a finger shuts off the power while you're reading.

Not worth the money to upgrade."
Nikki P.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I finally broke down and bought a new Paperwhite on Prime Day. After reading various reviews over the last year about the screen giving off glare, I was hesitant as I had a 7th Gen Paperwhite from a few years ago and loved it. With that being said as my biggest hold out on not getting a new one, well, I'm glad to say I don't think this new model has any unreasonable glare like some reviews state.

First, I don't tend to see the glare others are talking about. One thing that's weird to get used to is that the entire front is now screen where my older one had a frame. I feel like I'm going to turn the page when I touch the edges, but so far, I haven't had that problem. My only true problem to date has been that sometimes when I swipe to turn a page, the Settings menu comes up instead. Just a bit annoying. I also don't see why it needs to hold so many books. I don't know about others but I tend to download the books I have yet to read and once I've read them I delete them from my kindle. Maybe that's the OCD in me, but I don't like the clutter of tons of books. It's not like I can't re-download them from the kindle or the content page on the website.

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, but don't get me wrong, I would never have paid $129 for this. I only bought it when it was on sale. As a bonus I also got 3 months of kindle unlimited with it, which is nice, because there's no way I'm paying $10/month for that selection of books. Not worth it."
slagmi,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe replacing a 6th Gen Kindle Paperwhite(2014-2015). Thought this would be an improvement. Thinner? Maybe a millimeter or so. A few millimeters narrower. Lighter? Yes, by about 23 grams. Over 5% lighter. Battery life better? Nope. In fact I'm down to 22% after 10 days. Faster to come on or to navigate? No, it isn't. Screen bigger, better, sharper? Negative. In fact, in a casual setting, side by side, we can't tell them apart. (see photo). Can you?

Waterproof is nice, though my 6th Gen got wet so many times and never complained.
Bluetooth/Audible is, well, for people that don't have a phone maybe? ??
Extra storage? Let me be the first to tell you that having hundreds of books on your device just makes it difficult to navigate and dreadfully slow to sort.
The power button is still in the same weird location on the bottom of the device and still should be recessed, but protrudes instead.
Still using that 10 year old Micro USB Plug. No charger is included.

If you've never owned a Kindle Paperwhite it is a wonderful reading device, you can read comfortably in pitch darkness or the brightest sunshine with equal ease. If you already own an older Paperwhite, just keep it.

I've just gotten word that my trade-in has been refused. Perhaps I will keep my old Paperwhite. Unless it is now damaged. Good thing I have that photo!"
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always had a Kindle fire, and the only thing I've used it for is reading, so I thought to increase battery life that I would get the new paperwhite. However, the battery life is no different than the fire. I thought it would be ""weeks"" before I would need to charge. I am lucky if I can go 7 days without recharging. I know it is better than the ever 4-5 days that I could go with the fire, but still I was thinking triple or more battery life than the fire.
I have to say I'm extremely disappointed that I wasted my money on this.
The ONLY perk from the fire is that reading in the sun/brightness on the screen is amazing. I wasn't able to bring my fire outside to read, so there is that.

UPDATE: 5 Months later and battery life has gotten worse. I'm lucky if I can go 3 days between charges."
Kathleen F Yezek,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got multiple messages about arrival. Part of the order arrived, the rest has not. I don't like the this Kindle all. Constant ads interfere with EVERYTHING I try to do. I can't get to the books I've already bought and paid for. I can't get to anyone for help. Amazon says the phone number I've had NO Trouble using for 50 years is too short!!!! I had a Kindle DX since 2009 with none of these issues,but the battery had died. One star is really 1 too many as far as I am concerned."
Joo Y. Chung,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've wanted a Kindle for years to use as a dedicated reading device. Finally pulled the trigger during the $99 sale and ... well ... it's been a mixed bag.

First, the best part - the screen is just amazing. Reading on the high-dpi e-ink screen during the day is just wonderful. Little glare, low power use, sharp and crisp. Almost as good as reading on paper.

Now, some annoyances.

The battery life is not anywhere near what Amazon claims. In fact, in standby mode, my 2018 iPad retains more power than the Kindle. The Kindle will lose anywhere from 5 - 8 percent per day just in standby mode. Turning off the wifi and bluetooth helps immensely, but it's also quite inconvenient to keep the wireless features off as I have to now remember to connect to wifi to download any books sent, to do whispersync, etc. So I end up keeping the device plugged in much of the time while the radios are on.

The power button is located on the bottom of the unit, and is very easy to trigger. Even with a case I end up hitting the power button accidentally several times while reading. I tried changing my grip, but it's not been very comfortable no matter what I try. I understand that everyone holds their device a different way, and what is a problem for me might not be a problem for others, but I imagine that switching the power button to a slide button would alleviate many of the problems of accidentally powering off. Another possible solution might be to recess the power button slightly, or to even have a line of cases that makes the power button slightly recessed.

Unresponsive screen - There have also been many instances when the screen would stop responding to taps, and the device would end up registering multiple taps that would go through all at once.

Unable to zoom in on images - I like to read some historical books that have maps and other illustrations, and I'm unable to zoom in to anything. This is unlike the Kindle app on my phone / iPad, where I can pinch and zoom images. Being unable to zoom makes the reading experience worse on the Kindle than the phone. I realize this is a niche case but it seems like the e-ink devices should have all of the features of the app and perhaps more, and not vice versa. The e-ink screen is obviously the big draw, but having those additional features would certainly be nice.

Overally, at least for me, the Kindle's screen is nice but the device is plagued by usability issues that offset the pleasure of reading on the screen.

I'm trying to figure out how to"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a new Kindle 10th generation on 01-27-2020. I noticed a white spot, defect, in the screen and I made arrangements to replace this Kindle. I received a replacement on 01-30-2020. The features for the Kindle state the battery lasts for weeks and not hours however I noticed that this battery wasn’t holding a charge for more than a few hours.
I called the Kindle replacement center, and spoke with several different representatives. One stated that “just to educate me on how to use a Kindle” which I replied I didn’t need. For some reason I asked if the new Kindle I had purchased was replaced with a refurbished Kindle and responses became very vague. I was transferred to someone in either England or South Africa who asked which card to use as collateral on the account in regards to replacing my Kindle. I informed him that I had never been asked this before and I again asked if I was going to get a new Kindle, which I had paid for, or was I going to receive a refurbished Kindle. He responded he didn’t know until the Kindle I was returning was received. I asked to be transferred to the retail department in the United States for a full refund at which time I learned that the replacement Kindle was a refurbished one. I purchased a “new” Kindle and I was charged for a “new” Kindle. At no time was I told I was receiving a refurbished Kindle nor was I given any pricing credit. I think for those persons who’ve had problems with their Kindles it may be that they received refurbished Kindles instead of the new ones that they thought they had purchased."
All That Nerdy Stuff,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Out of the box, I fell pretty well in love with my new Kindle Paperwhite. The screen is easy on the eyes (big difference vs a tablet screen), the weight is negligible and the front light, while not amazing, is adequate if you insist on reading in a room with no light source.

It's a little slow in syncing, but to be honest, I have a big library, so I get it. I left it charging and syncing over night, and it was...well, almost done by morning.

I brought it to work, thinking I'd read a little here and there throughout the day, during the lulls, and this is when I noticed the most annoying thing: every little while, it randomly flips to displaying ads. So now, instead of just tapping to flip my page, I have to pick up the kindle, click the button, and sometimes--though not always--reopen my book. Half the time, I accidentally click the ad and then I have to wait to get back out of the store. It's incredibly annoying, and really ruins the experience. I'm seriously considering returning the device."
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Battery life is comparable to the fire tablets. I don't set the brightness to Max... I set it to about 10 out of 24. By the end of the day I have about 49% battery life. After investing Amazon's claim of batteru life FOR WEEKS... I found out they meant if you ONLY read 30 minutes per day. Yeah.

And to make matters worse... the micro USB for charging connects to the BOTTOM of the paperwhite. So if you want to charge it & read at the same time you have to sacrifice your cable to the gods because you KNOW the cable is going to bend and lose life because of the wear & tear. And you WON'T be able to prop the paperwhite on a pillow or on a kickstand WHILE CHARGING unless you want to kill your cable. At least if the screen could rotate so the plug was facing the TOP I would be able to charge & tead at the same tume without killing my cables. Alas... it is not meant to be.
And the lack of cases with actual KICKSTANDS is appalling. There are only about 3 different case styles... the only variation is color. I need a case that can save my paperwhite when I drop it while taking it out of my bag. And a kickstand that will NOT flop over because I can't do origami to the case.

And if I want to check out free books from my library I have to do a slew of extra steps... where in my fire tablet it was pretty seamless.

I tried. I gave it a shot. But I'm gonna go back to using my fire tablet. I can do so much more with a fire at the same price."
The Dave 3000,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle device and I am enjoying it quite well. It seems to be well built, yet it is light and I enjoy the small size form factor for reading books. The display on the device is quite nice and it is true that it is easy on the eyes in all lighting conditions. It is especially cool to be able to read it outside in direct sunlight and there is absolutely no wash out of the screen. Yet, even at night it remains easy to see with lights that shine down on the reading surface and not back lit shining into your eyes like a traditional tablet device. It has great storage capacity as well and when coupled with the Kindle Unlimited and/or Prime book service provides for many great book selections to choose from. I am pleased with my purchase and I really only have one critique of the device that I find to be somewhat less than stellar and that has to do with the limited grey scale display that it utilizes. Graphics and photos on this device really do not display well at all. Graphics or photos in a book cannot be zoomed in on or resized for proper viewing. I'm not sure if it's just an issue with the book I was reading or if it's a limitation of the device, but it certainly is annoying. I really miss having full color as opposed to grey scale, but if your main interest is just reading books - then it's a minor inconvenience."
Blue Mendolence,3.0 out of 5 stars,"There's probably a learning curve, and things may improve, though I'm not that hopeful. At the moment, the machine has been locking up, even as I take the Settings tour--and refusing to budge from a locked page.
The device is also much heavier than I expected--maybe I should have paid the extra $$$ and gotten one of the other models, that are allegedly lighter. I don't see myself lying on my back and holding the Paper White up in the air to read in bed-it's a bit like holding a small rock. True, it's a lot lighter than the boulder-like Kindle Fire I owned some years back--but this device seems best handled only if you are sitting up in an easy chair, or sitting somewhere else, in a standard ""at the library"" position, like in an aircraft.

The brightness setting is also somewhat dark--only in the last 4-6 notches does it become bright enough to give you sufficient contrast to read the letters. In a darkened room, the top setting of 24 is adequate, but not great. This is particularly a disappointment, since I would like to use this Kindle in different locations and under various lighting conditions. I was also surprised at the fact that this unit also seems to be heavily geared toward audio books--something that I personally have zero interest in, and am unlikely to download its Bluetooth features. Am wondering if its this capability that is giving this device the added heft and weight.

Lastly, I do not think it's that easy to navigate. The home navigation line at the top of the page is not visible all the times--possibly due to the fact that it keeps locking up. And all I'm doing is trying to go through the paces, to look at its features. So far the only way I've been able to get to do that is by restarting the device. In a word--this device is a disappointment.

One final point: The charging cord did not fit the Kindle's outlet--it seemed either too tight or the wrong shape. I had to use a cord from a different device to charge the Paper White. The cord that came with the Kindle also appeared to be of inferior manufacturing quality."
Karyn Methven,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the 32GB storage capacity. I adore how I can read book after book without getting eye strain. I love how thin and light this is. Great stuff.

Now what I DON'T LIKE.
This hardware has absolute crap software for organizing your books. I need to have books in a file, with author sub files. I do NOT want to have a book in a folder show up outside the folder. Yet, there we are. This is the most upsetting organizational software I have ever encountered. For the love of all that is holy, fix this so voracious readers won't become suicidal trying to find a book they read 45 books ago. Think like a librarian. Sane, organized, rational."

Update: I am returning the replacement Kindle, and including a video of the flaw. An amazon technician assured me that this review would be read and I'm hoping they will figure out how to correct this defect. If anybody contacts me I will update again.

Original review:
I have wanted a kindle reader for years, finally bought one. About half the time I love it. It's lightweight and I really enjoy the screen, when it's not FLASHING at me! Whenever there are graphics, such as the home page, or chapter breaks in book, or often just randomly the whole page flashes brightly when I touch the screen. It seems to be what would happen if the setting was on ""page refresh"", but I have that feature off.

I contacted Amazon, they were very responsive and send me a second Kindle. It does THE SAME THING. This must be a flaw on this model. I haven't had time to contact them again, but I will very soon. When it doesn't flash I love the reader, but the flashing is extremely irritating and when reading at night defeats the purpose of buying a Kindle with a soft light. Very frustrating."
Looking Glass,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I would consider myself somewhat of a tech enthusiast. Yet, for some reason, I never had an e-ink based reader. This is my first purchase. I had greater expectations in terms of speed and maneuverability. The screen is so slow, compared with even a cheap android tablet or even a Kindle Fire tablet. I am yet to figure out how to make the navigation bar appear - as of now, it is a hit and miss. The frontlit screen oozes a lot of white light (if you are in a dark area, almost as much as a backlit screen) and I wish it the light were softer.

The experimental browser, assuming it would work on the cellular network, could become a life changer in an emergency. If Amazon perfects this option, that would make this tablet so much more attractive."
Lil' Southern Girl,3.0 out of 5 stars,"There's a few features missing from Kindle that would make life easier for me. As an early adopter of e-readers (back in 2007 - first a Sony, then later a Kobo) I've curated an extensive virtual library. Enter two issues.

First - Kindle only supports the ""old"" mobi format, and doesn't support epub at all. My entire library is in epub format. since that's what almost everyone else uses. There also appear to be two different versions of the mobi format, and Kindle only supports the 'old' format. It took a bit of research, a couple of hours, and some trial and error, but I was eventually able to get books converted to work properly on the Kindle.

Second - And this is going to be an ongoing frustration - Kindle's handling of book series (or collections) is abysmal. In order to set up a book as a 'collection' you need to manually put it in a collection after transferring it over to the Kindle. It won't automatically recognize the ""series"" metadata and do this for you. As an avid reader with hundreds of books, the vast majority of them in series, this is a significant hassle every time I transfer a series over onto the kindle. I can at least tweak the titles to label them in a way that puts them together so I can find them (thank goodness!) but it's still a hassle.

Both of those those items could be fixed with a soft/firmware update (hint hint Amazon!)

On to the technical - Battery life seems fine so far. I keep it in airplane mode, I expect keeping wifi on would drain it faster, but I have no reason to use wifi. I was able to adjust the backlight down for nighttime reading. I was a little concerned about moving to a smaller screen (from 7"" to 6""), but this will fit into smaller purses, so there's that. It would be nice if other size options were available, as I do enjoy reading on the bike/treadmill. It's snappier than my old reader (which was 5 years old so that's expected). The 'flat' face is nice, means less dust will collect in the corners and makes it a little easier to clean. Plenty of memory since I use it strictly for reading.

When I took it out of the box, I noticed at the edges where the screen meets the... bezel? bumper? there seemed to be a little bubbling, it appears it may have just been a little manufacturing residue since it wiped off.

I do agree with the criticisms about the power button being on the bottom, but the case provides enough protection to prevent it from being accidentally shut off. I often rest it on something sitting up (think treadmill/bike), so it'd be very easy to rest it on that power button. Putting it on the bottom probably has more to do with the engineering design than user design though. Putting it on the top would make a lot more sense for users."
loveto travel,5.0 out of 5 stars,The battery life beats any tablet out there and the screen is easy on your eyes. Very simple to use and understand and can be up and running in moments. This is my 4th Kindel and 2nd paper white. I liked my 1st paper white so much I wanted a second for travel as I always seemed to forget mine trying to pack it at the last moment. I have an I pad but much prefer reading on the paper white.
Just Me,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not quite sure about some of the complaints and negative reviews. Battery life is great. Screen brightness is great. I’ve had no problems with the power button. Nor do I have an issue with the supplied usb cord. I’m also not understanding the complaints about goodreads. Nobody is forcing anyone to join the service. I personally enjoy my kindle. It’s lighter than the previous one (gen 7) that I had. The touch screen is responsive. I love being able to adjust the screen brightness based on my needs. I’ve read more in the past few years of owning a kindle then I have the rest of my adult life. Having a kindle (and the app) gives me easier access to books. I highly recommend getting a kindle.
Bonnie Dickson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm basing this on my own Kindle. This Kindle belongs to my husband who is not computer literate. I'm very happy with my waterproof Kindle paperwhite that I got last year. I can't speak to how waterproof it is since I haven't tested it. It stores an amazing quantity of books. I'm not so crazy about how the font size is changed. It's difficult to gauge exactly how far to stretch one's fingers and I generally have to make several tries to get the size I want. Then it's hard to keep it at the right size. That's the main complaint I have with the kindle itself. My other complaint isn't with the kindle but with the waterproof cover I bought for it. It seems senseless to get a non-waterproof cover for a waterproof device. So of course I bought the only cover that is waterproof. I bought the yellow so it would be easy to spot when I carry it in my purse when traveling. Not such a good idea as the yellow quickly became dirty. Also, the fabric is fraying. There are only two other colors and my husband has the blue. When I feel like I need a new cover when this one becomes too disreputable (which won't be very long from now), the only choice I'll have is the gray one, which I don't like and is likely to be hard to find in my bag. PLEASE bring out another waterproof cover or at the least, more colors in this one!"
Photoculturist,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to admit that I would never purchased this for myself. I kept telling myself that I preferred physical books, I’d miss flipping pages, I liked having a shelf full of books, etc.

For Christmas I got the Kindle and took it on vacation. I loved having it! I was able to read three books that I otherwise would not have brought as they take up space. The screen really does look like a paper page and while you don’t flip a page, I found I didn’t miss it. The battery also truly does last about a week and that’s with me using it for hours a day.

The ability to instantly get a new book was great and I am reading more than I was previously as I don’t have to wait for a physical book. The ability to check out books from your local library is also great.

Another plus is not needing multiple book cases. I move a lot and each time I dread packing up and hauling box after box of books. I love seeing a big book case full of books but realized I only re-read a few and the rest are basically an art piece. I will probably not buy another physical book again unless a very special case.

Pros:
Thin, light, very transportable
Holds hundreds of books
Battery life is excellent
No eye strain
Customizable font size, style

Cons:
No book to put on your shelf"
D. Hime,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It is lightweight, but screen is extremely sensitive. 2-3 times an hour the font changes size. Moreover, the battery life is abysmal. I cannot go through an entire day, after starting with 100% battery life, without having to recharge. I am not pleased."
sam i am,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have many Kindle devices.......fires, various older e-readers and paperwhites of various vintages. Although I use and love them all, the new paperwhite is my favorite and the ones (I have a few) I use the most. My husband has a B&N ""Nook"" , which I am not fond of at all. My kids and I use the paperwhites and share tons of books that we enjoy.

The new paperwhite is a nice improvement over the last ones in that it is waterproof (although I would never test it on purpose). I used to be so paranoid about taking one of my paperwhite to the beach or lake and now I do not worry so much. The battery life may not be weeks, but it certainly is adequate for any extended use. It is even more user friendly than before and is the ideal size compared to some of the larger e-readers or the fire devices, so I can use it with one hand. I carry one wherever I go in my handbag and I never have to sit idly and wait without a book to read.

I use the paperwhite for reading novels and other books with no graphics. Journals, textbooks and similar I read on my fire devices or the old large DX e-reader. The special offers are just a lock screen image of a new book or things like that. I even have discovered new books to read through them. I was not particularly pleased with the cellular connectivity that I have on one paperwhite. It seemed great to find a new book when I was unable to connect to wifi, but it would not download until I connected to a wifi network!! So what is the advantage? I have also found that the 8GB size is great for me, as 8 GB holds a lot of books.

In all the years that we have owned paperwhites (since its debut), we have never had a single problem with any of them. The kindles with mechanical keyboards went bad, but the touchscreen on the paperwhite solves that issue. In conclusion, the paperwhite is a wonderful device and worthy of 5 stars."
janetsbookmark,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered my Amazon Kindle Paperwhite on July 16, 2019. It will no longer take a charge.

I have verified that the cable and charging brick work on my husband's Kindle. I have used this Kindle according to the recommended use and charging in the product manual.

I would like to replace the Kindle since it is less than a year old. Your Return/Replace process online will not allow me to start this process in motion.

This is my biggest beef with Amazon! Great products available with a fast delivery time. Customer service? Not so much. I tried to call, and you are not accepting calls.

HOW DO I REQUEST A REPLACEMENT?! (And, yes, I am yelling.)"
Brian D. Rogers,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got into I think a 3rd or 4th generation Kindle years ago, and sold it, to get into a similar sized Fire. Once I got into my Samsung tablet, the smaller fire was too small so I got the 10”. Now, I’m back to the much smaller and lighter paper white in this size. Each time I sold my previous Kindle it was to someone looking to get into an ereader. Kindle to me is still the best. Tablets are too heavy to hold one handed for extended periods. Plus, reading off a tablet isn’t always easy. The smaller paper white easily slips into my jacket pocket making being mobile with it far more appealing than heading out in public with say an iPad or the 10” Fire tablet. Screen response is a little lagged but I’m only reading on a kindle, not performing, music editing or art features like I am on my iPad. The screen light is awesome allowing dark environment reading with zero difficulty. One power port, and one power button simplify the outside, and I LOVE the touch screen. This a Kindle does all I’d ever ask, now, waterproof? I don’t care what claims are made, this device has a power port and water finds the easiest path. I’m am NOT trusting the Kindle with.a full out dunking in the pool or any other water. I trust it will handle rain drops on the screen just fine. I’m excited to have this Kindle in my portable media arsenal."
BookieBeans,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this new Paperwhite as a gift to replace a Kindle Voyage. One of the immediate things I noticed was how light this is in comparison to the Voyage. For someone that has achy wrists, this was a pleasant surprise. I had contemplated the Oasis, but the fact that is was going to be heavier like the voyage, coupled with the clunky side buttons and somewhat odd dimensions, I decided I would prefer the Paperwhite. I'm so happy I requested it instead! While many reviews state that the glass screen of the Oasis or Voyage has better visibility, I disagree. I was never overly happy with the screen in the voyage. The Paperwhite is bright, crisp, and clear, and I find it MUCH easier and more pleasant to read on. The Paperwhite doesn't have auto-adjustment lighting, but I actually find that better, as there were times the Voyage would be too quick to adjust the light of my kindle, resulting in it often being too dark in certain circumstances. I prefer the ability to adjust it myself. Finally, I opted for the 32 GB version. While I thought this might be overkill, I am happy with the decision. The price point for the added storage was very reasonable. I was worried that the 8GB would not hold out for years to come as my library continues to grow. Further, since the new Paperwhite has the ability to download your Audible audiobooks, I felt it would be a MUCH safer decision to opt for the added storage. As a reference point, we have around 880 books in our library and around 60 audiobooks. I have a little over 26 GB of storage left after registering the Kindle to my account."
Beth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I love books, but I lack the space to store them. This was made painfully clear to me the last time I moved and had to donate eight bags of books, which was hard, because books are kind of a personal thing. We are physically attached to them through sentiment. There is nothing better than cracking open a book - old or new - and having the scent of those pages waft through your senses, or worse, having to chuck them because you have no space to store them. That experience made the Kindle make more sense to me, due to my small space predicament.

As this is my first Kindle, I don't really have anything to compare it to, so take that into consideration.

Physically: I love the matte screen. There's not a lot of glare unless it's facing a light source directly (which you might see in my picture - light fixture directly overhead), and when you're reading it feels like looking at the page of an actual book. I tend to read in bed, in the dark, so the adjustable light level setting is an eye saver. The battery life on this thing is also a big plus. It can sit on my bed for days, weeks even, and has never powered down for lack of juice. It also doesn't take long to charge. I do recommend getting a cover for it for two reasons: 1) it protects the unit/screen from damage; and 2) it puts the unit to sleep when you close the cover.

Digitally: I don't have a massive amount of books on this Kindle, but I have at least sixteen titles, which feels like a lot to me. Nevertheless, I like that I can switch between titles through the library depending on my mood. I can also add books to my wish list, if I'm not ready to purchase them at that moment. You can search any author/title/genre and, I have to say, I've been happy with the suggestions that Amazon makes within their ""ad"" component. It doesn't feel like an ad and I've found some great reading there. They also give you the option to read some titles for free with Amazon Prime.

In all, this has been the perfect solution for someone who loves books, but who cannot store them due to space limitations. I wish I could have the Hogwarts library, but reality dictates another solution."
Sarah,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like how small and light this Kindle is. It fits perfectly in my purse when I might need to have reading material handy. It’s helpful to have a device with amazing battery life that doesn’t also ping every thirty seconds with texts, emails, etc. so that I can read uninterrupted. The screen brightness is adaptable to all light situations I’m in and is easy to read.

Now for the really big cons that knocked it down from 5 stars to 3... the refresh on the screen is hideous. I’m not talking about the feature that allows you to turn off “redraw” every time you turn the page. I’m talking about when navigating menus and settings and scrolling through books etc. Each time I tap any button, there’s a brief flash while the e-ink redraws the page and it’s noticeable and distracting and slow. It makes navigating anything on this device clunky and difficult. The menus are also not set up well, such that I can’t find buttons I want and have to google how to make changes. Maybe I’m used to the iOS Kindle app that is much more responsive, fluid, and intuitive to use.

That said, I will likely keep the Kindle as it’s more trouble to return than to keep, and I like that I have a separate reading device, but it’s only tolerable, not great. Too bad. Glad I was able to catch it on sale or I’d definitely be returning it! For that amount of money, and with the lengthy history of product/software development from Kindle/Amazon, I expected more."
Faith Marston,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 5th Kindle. I have had 2 Kindle Keyboards, an older Paperwhite and the Voyage. I wanted the 32GB Paperwhite because I wanted to download all my books and leave them on the device so I wouldn’t have to use the WiFi unless I bought a new book. I'm so disappointed in this Kindle! It was a Christmas gift and the first one would not hold a charge, was sent a replacement. That one the battery life was okay but it would not sync up and download books unless I held the power button in for 40 seconds and released it. Got another replacement. That one did the exact same thing. So I got yet another replacement and this replacement is doing the exact same thing! So far I’ve been told by several people in the call center that I have too many books and that is why the syncing stops working. I have also been told that I will not be able to store all my books on the 32GB Kindle anyway because it would not be able to handle storing them. So why would Amazon make a 32GB Kindle if you can’t store all your books on the device? I realize I have a lot of books. I have been reading with an ereader for almost 20 years so I have accumulated a lot of books over the years. I downloaded my entire library on my 256GB phone so I could see how much space I needed for all of them and they didn’t even take up 20GB of space so I thought this Kindle would be perfect. Unfortunately it is not and I am returning my 4th replacement for a refund. It is very disappointing!"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only reason I purchased this was because the storage capacity was increased (as I have tons of books I'm reading) but as others have stated the battery life sucks. I have to charge this every night and sometimes during the day even if it has not been used. When I leave for work it is 100% but by the time I get t work (30 minutes later), it's down to 85%. Backlight is down as low as I can get it without straining my eyes, Wi-Fi is off, and Bluetooth is not on. Amazon needs to install a patch or something to fix the battery issues. Battery life is hours not days or weeks.

Update:
I received a phone call from Amazon tech support and she gave me the following instructions
-Charge the device overnight to 100% without an external case on the device.
-Make sure the device is idle for a minimum of 5 hours.
-Do not use the device in hot conditions.
-Use Amazon Adapter and Cable to charge the device.
-Use the device next day without device cover.

I held the power button for 40 seconds until the Kindle screen came on and it restarted. Battery stopped draining so fast. I will try these steps tonight and tomorrow and update.

Tried the steps last night and battery life is just fine. Amazon needs to put these steps on the help page."
Barry,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I replaced my original 9 year old Kindle 3G with the Paperwhite because the 3G's USB charging port finally broke. I mostly use the excellent Kindle App on my iPads but the 3G works great in bright sun (where the iPad doesn't). In comparison, the Paperwhite does not perform anywhere near as well as the old 3G or iPads. First, the Paperwhite seems to have a very slow CPU because there is an annoying and very noticeable delay between an action and a response. For example, entering the security code at startup is awkward because of the very noticeable delay between entering a number and it appearing on the screen. Second, instead of a reliable instant page turn by just touching the edge of the screen (or pressing the buttons on the 3G), a kind of finger wipe is necessary and frequently the page turns the wrong way or does not turn at all. I am guessing the apparently very slow CPU just cannot cope well with the touch screen. Third, touching the center of the screen on the Kindle iPad App shrinks the page and brings up a row of small pages that can be quickly scrolled through to get to another part of the book or just find something quickly. Also, the pages read, to be read, etc. are shown. This does not happen on the Paperwhite. At $120 it was not very expensive but that still does justify a product that is so annoying to use. The Paperwhite's touch screen should provide features and convenience to make it a far superior product to the nine year old 3G, but, instead, the 3G is a much more satisfying machine to use because it is instantly responsive and reliably responds to commands. I was prompted to write this when I just realized I am going to try to charge the 3G instead of taking the new Paperwhite to the beach today."
Riceboy2049,1.0 out of 5 stars,"2nd kindle that has died within a year. They stop being able to charge and then brick. Stay away, their customer service is terrible. If its even 1 day over the 1 year warranty period, they will reject the claim.

I honestly don't know the point of rejecting warranty service over a sub 100 item item that's about a week over warranty, because all this does is make your company and boss look really really cheap, and your product sub-standard. If the customer rep (Tarsha B.) and her manager is thinking that this is somehow saving the company money; It's not because of reviews like this. Did I just call out people in a review? Yeah, yeah I did. Oh, and you too ~Anu~, you were no help and echoed the same pre-filled response.

Update: Out of the blue about a month later, their devices group contacted me offering to refund the price if I sent the unit back to their testing labs so they can perform an analysis on the bricked unit. This appears to be a fairly known problem according to the rep, as they revealed that were trying to gather enough testing units to find out why it keeps happening. Unfortunately, their customer support reps and managers have obviously been told to simply offer a small recycling credit for broken device, which means that no units will ever make it to the lab for analysis. This seems to echo systemic miscommunications between groups within Amazon as they are obviously not talking with each other.

Bottom line, the fact that they reached out to try to get their hands on this unit speaks volumes about the problems these devices have. Any attorneys out there may want to have a look into this, because I definitely smell class action. I don't need to remind you guys that amazon is a Trillion dollar company."
r davis,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought two Waterproof Kindle Paperwhite's. One for myself and one for my husband. I have the Kindle App on my Ipad but there are too many distractions or at least I am too easily distracted with the internet in my hands lol. I am a serial multi-tasker.

Both tablets arrived in a timely fashion before Xmas. The unboxing was without incident. However, on Christmas morning when we opened our presents, my husband's device worked and mine unfortunately did not. There was a large battery icon with an exclamation point in the center of it on the screen.

After charging the device with the included power cord ( plugged into the wall ) for about 7 hours and trying several times to hold the power button down to re-boot ( like the internet said ) it was to no avail.

I was pleased with Amazon customer service, who walked me through the same steps even though I knew it wouldn't work. At the end of about a 10 minute phone call, the rep explained that he would send me a new replacement device. I received it today, unboxed it ( it comes 51% charged) used it to browse a few samples and books I already own and proceeded to charge it to 100%.

Overall I am happy. I can set a timer on the device to ensure I reach a target goal daily. I can carry alllllll my books wherever I go ( or at least what i'm reading now ) and I can limit distractions from alerts on my phone/tablet and limit my ability to browse......

My suggestion - don't ever let the device battery die."
Bibliophile 13,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, I'm excited that this is supposedly water resistant (I haven't had any reason to use that particular feature, thankfully), but I do hope that feature is better than the battery or the screen. Prior to this Kindle, I had one from maybe 2015 or 2016, and I liked it so much better. This ""flat"" screen is great for not seeing the edges of the screen protector, but the sensitivity is kind of bad. The very edges of the screen seem to have no sensitivity at all, so it is rather frustrating trying to get it to display different location and time-left information or the bookmarks. Also, the charge this battery holds is ridiculously short compared to my old Kindle. I have to charge this one about every three days - I could go over a week on my old one. I'm glad to have water resistance and more storage, but I'm definitely not happy with the screen or battery."
Raging45,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sadly I had to replace my last generation kindle because the screen was scratched. I expected this one to be a nice upgrade.... but so far I'm not impressed.

The battery life of this model is very poor when compared to the previous model. Why doesn't this use a USB-C charge port??? Inexcusable.... One of the worst things is the blue undertone in the screen, instead of a bright, crisp white.

It's so bad I'm considering just using my scratched previous gen model! (The scratch lets a ton of light through).

If this is your first kindle, you will prolly love it. If you have the previous model and are considering an upgrade, I wouldn't recommend it!!!"
Erinlea,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I left my Kindle paperwhite outside in the rain for 2 days...

Two.....days... you guys

So if you’ve been on the fence about purchasing the newest version of the paperwhite, do it. Perhaps you’re not as irresponsible as I am (mom brain lol) but the waterproof feature alone is worth it to me! There’s not a single thing wrong with it, and it’s even 88% charged still! I’m talking about two solid days of constant rain, out on the ground next to my daughters swing set. It still charges perfectly, the light works, WiFi, Bluetooth, you name it; it all works!

Don’t let the negative reviews scare you away. If you’re the beach goin, pool floatin, lake day kinda person... you want this kindle. It’s an exceptional product. I wasn’t even scared to tell my husband that I left it outside in the rain for 2 days, because I knew he’d be impressed with the quality as well :)"
Carlos Flores,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best investment I have done!! i love this device, I dont know why I didnt buy it before. Im a read physical books guy, I never liked to read from the computer or cellphone because my eyes gets tired really quick and also I like the feel of physical books, but with the kindle i had a conversion to digital books. It is so easy to read on it, i have a lot of books in there so i only have to carry one thing. Because of the e-ink my eyes are fine for the same time as a physical book. I really recomment this device for any book reader enthusiast"
my dog's servant,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an early Nook reader for years, and I honestly don't see the Paperwhite as much of an improvement. The Nook finally died, which wasn't a real problem because I'd been doing most of my reading on either my smaller Fire, the larger Fire HD, or my iPhone, with the iPhone being my reader of choice because it was so easy to hold in one hand and the screen clarity was outstanding. Not to mention the portability! But the Fires and iPhones have the blue light, which is supposed to interfere with sleep patterns, and since I always read in bed before falling asleep I figured I'd buy another plain reader. I was really looking forward to the Paperwhite, but, frankly, it's been a huge disappointment. It's slow and unresponsive compared to the Fires and iPhone, the ""improved"" screen clarity isn't much of an improvement over my ancient Nook, as far as I'm concerned, and its tendency to flicker to white on black when moving to a new page is beyond annoying. I've gotten used to it, but I still really don't like it. I wasn't interested in getting the top of the line reader because the curved side doesn't provide adequate adaptability in choice of which hand holds the thing. I still don't want it because of that, but the Paperwhite isn't much of a choice, either, as far as I'm concerned. I'm using it, but I'm not really liking it."
Miss Jane,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited a few days before I wrote this review because I was very upset when I received the thin little box that brought this Kindle to me and wanted to cool off. But the more I think about it, the more upset I get. I bought this as a Christmas gift because I have a paperwhite that has served me well and am welcoming a daughter-in-law to the family who is an avid reader. When I purchased my paperwhite, an adapter was included with the purchase. Makes sense to me because you have to have the adapter to make the electronic work, right? No, now you have to purchase it separately. Really!?! You are using a product I purchased to already further your own business (those ""special offers"" included on the device) and you won't pony up for an adapter that probably costs pennies for you. Now I am torn between returning the device or just buying an adapter for less money from somewhere else. Amazon, you are truly testing this Prime member's loyalty by ""chintzing"" out on a product that I have recommended to others for years. Is THAT worth the price of an adapter?"
GrumpyDragon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this for Christmas as an ""upgrade"" to my first gen Kindle which I love dearly.

Comparing this Kindle against that one....wait what's the difference again?

The software and UI feel exactly like the first gen Kindle but now with touch features which can only be best described as out-of-place. Despite technology advancements in smartphones that have made them more fluid and user friendly, ALL of the interface looks and feels EXACTLY like first a gen kindle. The scrolling (of which there is thankfully little) and menu pull downs are finicky and stilted. I can never get the main menu to drop down. I accidentally flip pages all the time by touching the screen. The screens change with a stiff, noticeable lag. All the screens are monochrome. It feels exceptionally dated. Which is fine if I'm using a first gen Kindle. But this thing is just a waste of money, same exact device with gimmicky touch features.

Oh another gripe: the Wake Button at the bottom is easily bumped on and off ALL THE TIME. And you now have to swipe the screen after you hit the button to unlock the device. Which reminds me - there's often a boot lag when you unlock it, never had that before with 1st gen Kindle (it will say ""wait booting up""). Anyhow, the wake button / swipe combo proves only a hassle to the Kindle owner as the device will still miraculously turn itself on in my gym bag and use up all its battery. Meanwhile the wake button, if even touched slightly will put the device back to sleep. I like to read on the elliptical or treadmill and this will happen very often - I will pick it up hit the wake button, swipe to unlock, then wait for to boot, put it down on the treadmill only to have it hit the button and put itself back to sleep. Repeat. So frustrating. My friend has all the same problems.

Back light is nice and waterproofness is a thoughtful feature. However, not worth the pains aforementioned. Maybe its just me but I find 98% of the time I am in a well lit area that is dry...

Recently I had my car broken into. The only thing they took was the Kindle Paperwhite which I had absent-mindedly left on my passenger seat (I'm usually good about bringing everything in Doh!). I've never been robbed of something and felt so relieved. I'm going back to my first gen Kindle. I hope the thief is able to read something good on there, gain some insight about the world, and become a better person - but I really doubt they will get past the awful finicky cumbersome design. We all lose with Kindle Paperweight ... er White."
M. Vanco,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like books. I mean real, hold in your hand, turn the page, smell the dead trees books. But books take up space. My husband travels a lot so an e reader made sense and he really likes his. So for Christmas I asked for one of my own as I have been traveling more as well and he has ""bought"" a lot of books I would like to read. I have a second gen fire tab but reading on that screen can hurt my eyes pretty bad. I really did like how it functioned and I thought the paper white would be the same just a single function with an easy on the eyes screen. The screen is easy on the eyes but it is so choppy and picky it causes some frustration when trying to get to different menus. It is not very intuitive and trying to remember how to navigate out once you entered a book is a bit annoying especially when it enters a book every few seconds as you are just trying to SCROLL THROUGH THEM.... I do like the water proof feature because the first day my husband splashed some coffee on it when trying to help me figure out how to work it then later dropped it in the snow unpacking. I would gladly give up battery life for a smoother screen though. It feels like going back to dial up after years of high speed. I will keep buying real books and only using this to ""borrow"" books from the hubby."
LJSA,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If I could give negative stars, I would do so. Screen glare is much worse than my old device. It's waterproof (in theory). Meh. I accomplished the same thing on the old device with a $20 case and got drop protection as well. There is no case with drop protection for the new device, just a leather or cloth cover.

I planned to upgrade to the newer version of Kindle Paperwhite specifically because Amazon could not get my collections to sync if I created them online. I had to make collections and add items to them on the device, which was cumbersome. I wanted to be able to create collections (or at least add books to collections) online in my Amazon content and download to device. I was assured by Amazon customer service prior to making the purchase that the newer versions of the Kindle Paperwhite addressed this issue and I would be able to do so.

I live in a rural area, so wanted the option of using 3G. However, that added $100 to the price, so I decided to make do with mobile wifi hotspot on my phone. New device arrived, I set it up and registered - slowly, much more so than the old device, which could use 3G. Of 67 collections, 5 downloaded. So, I brought the device to a university with actual wifi the next day. Still only 5 collections downloaded.

After 1.5 hours on the phone with Amazon customer service, factory reset, etc., I'm told they will put in a ticket and, after 3 business days, they will move my collections from the old device to the new one. In addition, anytime I want to sync collections with my online content, I'll need to contact Amazon and go through the 3 business day process. My other option is to continue making collections on the new device only.

No thanks. I'm not dropping money for a new device that not only does nothing my old one didn't, it doesn't do some things the old one did. I'm returning this device for refund. Syncing collections seems to be an ongoing issue (hence my questions before purchasing), based on user comments. Perhaps Amazon should work on resolving it. Overall, disappointing and frustrating. I'm delighted that I held onto the old device."
KMF,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought these to help keep us occupied during self-quarantine. We bought two waterproof models, and they arrived so much faster than we were expecting! They work great, and already I have read more books in the last week since it was delivered, than I did all last year! I came from reading my e-books on an iPad, so the fact that this looks like a real book has really helped my eyes from straining from reading so much, so the screen has a little bit of a lag it is not anything that disrupts the user experience. My one complaint is I have read everywhere that this battery will last for weeks; I keep mine on airplane mode, and will adjust the brightness as needed, keeping it as low as possible, and We found we will be lucky to get to last one week without a charge. Which is fine, charging it is not the issue, but this battery life was so hyped up everywhere I read about the Kindle paperwhite, and it is nothing to write home about. All in all, Kendall has made two more very happy readers! We found we will be lucky to get to last one week without a charge. Which is fine, charging it is not the issue, but this battery life was so hyped up everywhere I read about the Kindle paperwhite, and it is nothing to write home about.

TC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwight is smaller than I expected, and the black and white format a dullard in the high definition retina display world of phones, laptops and tablets. But that size makes it light and very portable, great for travel. You can adjust the font size to compensate for your visual infirmity. The interface is not intuitive, and takes some time to master. A tap is the same as a swipe, in terms of turning a page. Bookmarks, moving among them, getting out of one book and getting to another: it's like trying to follow a GPS that is not working well. Maps and illustrations cannot be enlarged or zoomed. But for a book that you are reading in a linear fashion, the Kindle works very well. Battery life is excellent. The red leather cover I bought is snazzy. Magazines and books I might like to peruse while on the road can be added as needed. Travel guides, though, the physical Gutenberg version is still the best. You can mark up the pages, easily move from one section to another just by wedging your finger in a particular spot."
mike,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated 4/19/19review scroll down further please -Had it only a day so I may update as I give it a few more days but ...the response of this screen I believe is normal and not a defective issue...I wish it was defective..then I could just replace it. This is not a cell phone this is not a I pad it's doing what I believe it is supposed to do .the issue -the lag the wait the flickering will it do it will it not ? This feels cheap in executing any touch commands I'm less then impressed and I'm thinking yeah you should have just stayed with your phone that actually does on cue what its told ...I turn a page it flickers then maybe it will maybe it wont but then eventually yeah it does turn page ..the flaw is not specifically me or my device it's the kindle and my just general expectations for this to be a 2018 product not a 1998 in progress ..if i never had cellphone technology or a iPad and it was 20 yrs ago I might be impressed but eventually I would still be aggravated waiting on will it do it will it flicker will it just do nothing. This is not 2018 functional technology it's as if they still arent there yet ..no I'm not happy but I'm willing to give it a few days before I send it back or throw it in my drawer of unimpressive products. What is really sad is I believe that this kindle paperwhite is doing exactly what it's made to do ..yes it's only been a day but it only took 5 minutes to be impressed with my kindle fire of which I should have stayed with despite its lack of storage. If I told it something it just did it ...it didn't have to think ,...I didnt have to think- will it or won't it ? To think I was excited for an unresponsive slow start slow to to do anything. How did anyone ever from its inception to 2018 ever give the functionality a pass let alone an impressive number...I will give it a few more days ..but wow this is actually selling in 2019 .OK 4/19/19 update .!!!! .as of now after using it I feel a little better my expectations may have been slightly unbalanced I have added a star ..as I have grown used to the negatives I am a little more confident about this product..just know this if you have never used a kindle dont base any opinion on it buy a fire or a smart phone it's not that in response .this one takes patience and it's not pretty..and functionality it's not what your used to ,but it is what everyone says is cool ...so yes if it's a ereader you want I adjusted my review enough to suggest it ..it does what it is supposed to do"
RobertSirc,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, it’s better than my last kindle the previous gen. I used that one until the day I sent it in for a trade in. Charged it up put it all back in the packaging my new one came in. Only to have Amazon tell me it’s not working. Not gonna lie it’s infuriating. Don’t trade in your old kindle for a new one look at the Nook or something else."
LAS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The biggest complaint is that it will not pair with any of the several bluetooth headphones in my house. Good, expensive headphones that I purchased on Amazon. Several Sony, Samsung and other brands. Also won’t find my Echo. The only speaker it finds is the 8 yr old Soundbar connected to my TV. I bought this specifically for audiobooks and because it is easier on my eyes than using my ipad. Such a major disappointment as I will now need to travel with both to use audiobooks, too.

Update (1):
I've updated the Kindle firmware, and in the end I had to buy another set of headphones, from Amazon, that will hopefully work. In the meantime, I can't get the kindle to download any additional Audiobooks, even though it has 12 GB of free space. They simply won't download any more. I'm right next to the router. They dowloaded last week. I'm so frustrated an annoyed with this product, but I need something to save my eyes for reading, so I'm reluctantly keeping it even though it DOES NOT live up to my expectations at all.

Update (2):
Bought the headset that Amazon sells in a bundle with the Paperwhite, and my Paperwhite STILL WON'T PAIR. When i contacted Amazon support, they said it's the headset, not the Paperwhite, advised me to reset to factory and update software again, which I already did, and then disconnected me.

Update (3):
It took multiple calls with Support, but finally someone told me that I have to remove the passcode on my device, and then it will find my headset(s). Why this is the case is beyond me, but now that I've done that, I'm satisfied, except I had to factory reset multiple times and download my entire library multiple times. It took a full day to download all of my content each time, but I specifically wanted all of my content on the go since I'm a habitual re-reader, which is why I bought the 32 gb version. It was such a long road to get here. But this product is light-weight, easy on the eyes, bluetooth now works well. Went from 1 star to 4 stars in my mind."
InternetMom13,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Based on the number of negative comments, I held off on posting a review until I had the e-reader for a few weeks, to see if what was being said held true.

The only reason I even bought this new Kindle Paperwhite is because my 4 year old Kindle Paperwhite went to device heaven and I roughly 1200 books! And it only needed to be charged after 3 weeks of reading 20 - 30 minutes every day. After reading what so many reviewers had to say I was reluctant to replace my device with this model but finally gave in.

Like many others have said, the battery life is nowhere near as good as the product description claims. One problem I've experienced is during charging - the light goes from yellow to green when it's only 96% or 97% charged. I have to leave it connected for an additional hour or two to fully charge the Paperwhite to 100%. Then later in the day when I 'wake' the device the percent is 98% without using it! I've had this Paperwhite for less than 3 weeks and have had to charge it twice! Not only does the power diminish too quickly while reading but somehow the power depletes when it's closed and in sleep mode! Since I rarely read for more than 20 - 30 minutes at a time and not always every day that's puzzling and concerning. I use the Kindle Paperwhite on airplane mode, only turning wifi when I need to download books so that can't be using all the power. I imagine the only way to prevent that problem would be to shut it down completely every time. That would be a major annoyance when you just want to pick it up and read for a while. Besides I'm not even sure that would prevent the shoddy battery from holding the charge.

Additionally, the touch screen doesn't seem to work as well as my older model Paperwhite. Often I have to touch/press several times to change pages, see my library, etc. That's not a major turn-of but it is frustrating.

Personally I have no use for Audible or the bluetooth feature so those things had no affect on my purchase decision. I truly wish Amazon offered those two things as options or sold two different models, one with Audible and bluetooth and one without (at a lower cost).

If I could have put a new battery in my former Kindle Paperwhite that would have been ideal. Clearly Amazon wants people to purchase new devices every few years. They certainly don't want customers to be able to just buy a replacement battery because it would hurt their profits and that's quite upsetting!"
M. L. Smith,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Went from an old Kindle 2 to a Kindle 10 Paperwhite. The new one is smaller and lighter. I prefer reading on this to my Kindle Fire. The Paperwhite is certainly best for just reading, though the improvement in contrast and resolution is not quite what I expected going from my old K2 model. Another minor nitpick is, when turning pages, the new page will sometimes briefly flash a reverse image (white type on black) but I understand this is just a by product of this type of screen. The biggest improvement of this over my old K2 is the built-in light which adjusts automatically as the ambient light changes. One can move from under a reading light (or sunlight) to darker surroundings and the screen adjusts instantly and smoothly to allow uninterrupted reading -- very nice. Finally, concerning battery life, I routinely got 3 weeks to a month of battery life from my K2 but only get about 1 1/2 weeks from my new Kindle. This is likely due to the built-in reading light, so it may do better if I do more reading with good background light. Sometime an improvement in one area call for a compromise in another. That said, this Kindle is a keeper and I'm happy with it. As noted, if you want to just read books, the Paperwhite is a much better choice than the Fire models."
Adam Berry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It reads just like paper in broad daylight, and using the backlight at night it reads even better than a normal book with a reading light. This thing can hold an astounding amount of data, and the bluetooth audio is a real nice touch (albeit not one I've used much.) I originally planned on paying the extra fee to avoid having the ads display, but honestly I don't mind them. And since I tend to be a little reluctant to crawl out of my shell, they are ultimately a good thing, suggesting content I might not otherwise have given the time of day. I suspect Amazon uses some sort of algorithm to only suggest books that would interest me, because to date I have not seen a single one that I went ""Ugh..are you kidding?""
The battery life is insane, especially if you don't use the backlight much. I have a little solar panel that I clip to my pack with a carabiner, and just the ambient solar energy (i.e. not making a specific effort to place the collector in direct sunlight) has been able to keep this thing topped off at 100% since I first hooked it up.
It does take a very noticeable amount of time for the screen to update, which is negligible when paging through text, but slightly disruptive when reading graphic novels. You can zoom in and out to view more detailed images, but you do need to wait for a second for the image to update to maximum resolution. That to me is a fair trade, for being able to read this clearly in broad direct daylight.
Does it replace books? I'd say no ultimately, since it does require electricity, but since it can store multiple books in a device the size of a pop tart, and you can keep it charged for free indefinitely with a basic solar panel, I'd say it's better than a book."
Elora,3.0 out of 5 stars,"There are great things about the Kindle Paper White. I love flat screen and the adaptable brightness. And as this is my 3rd kindle, I'm sold on the Kindle E-readers.
I'm just not quite sure I love this kindle paperwhite. But it maybe because I ""downgraded"" from the Kindle Voyage. My Voyage battery was dying and would only hold a charge for 2-3 hours between charges. I didnt like needing be plugged into the wall to read, and one of my absolute favorite aspects of the Kindle is the battery life for this ""tablet."" It would last weeks, no less than 2.5 weeks with daily reading of a minimum of 2 hours, and even continuous days of 10+ hours reading. And my Voyage battery would still last at least 2weeks.
With the new Paperwhite releasing at the same time as my Voyage dying I decided it would be worth the purchase.
I've had my paperwhite for 3 months now and I'm a little disappointed. My battery life with 2-3 hour nightly reading (wifi, bluetooth off, brightness set at 9-10) only lasts me about 6 days, and then it needs to charge.
The power button, and it's a button not a slider, sits exactly where my pinky finger holds up the device, which I know is a picky picky thing, but the first month of using the device I consistently shut off the device while reading. And because the on/off button is an actual button if you prop up the device (no cover) on a hard surface you will often shut off the device.
I often find that the touch screen callaboration is finicky, and opening the Kindle Store often results in freezing and slow other functions.
The ""Synch my Kindle"" option in use with high speed internet often doesn't bring new bought books from computer or pre-ordered books to my home screen or not downloaded library. Making the need to search for that new book.
Whisper-synching between devices, such as from Kindle app on Smart phone to Kindle works about 10% of the time, even when both devices are in the same room connected to the same wifi network.

As I said maybe I'm a little harsher as I LOVED LOVED LOVED my kindle voyage. But I guess I was hoping with the new design and ""upgrades"" of the kindle paperwhite it would be on par with the first edition Kindle Voyage with the perks of being waterproof.
Overall, I still get to have all my favorite books with me on one device that isn't and actual tablet. I just need to charge it at least once a week, maybe even twice if I'm on reading binge."
Smishop,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife's Fire, which I inherited when she downsized, really didn't work well as an e-reader. Too big, too heavy and bright, and not enough battery life to take, say, on a camping trip. My new Paperwhite fixes many of those problems! It takes very little space, even in its case. The battery easily gets me through a couple of novels, even if I use the light, which, by the way, has finely adjustable brightness. The Paperwhite is at its best, though, in ambient light, outdoors or in, with its own light turned off. The screen is clear, with plenty of resolution, and contrast never lacks. When I am reading in the dark I find the built-in light a little, well, murky? The screen doesn't seem as sharp then, and the page really isn't very white- it definitely tends towards bluish grey. Maybe I don't keep the light on high enough, but then it's too bright. Still, if you share a bed and don't want to keep your partner up, this is the way to go.
Other gripes? The touch screen is often slow to respond, though page-turning is always very quick. The slowness comes up when you're navigating through your library or pretty much doing anything from the home screen.
I don't like the cluttered and confusing home page.
And I know I have expressed approval for how small and light the thing is, but I would buy a slightly larger one if it was out there. The screen is very small, and when I am engrossed in a good book, turning the page every few seconds gets a little old. You need two hands, or to hold it just the right way with one , or you need to have it propped up sturdily enough that you don't move it when tapping it to turn the page. It is, though, more convenient to use than a paperback book.
It would be so very cool if the thing could be set up to scroll up, faster or slower, responding to a verbal command!
I am overall very happy with my Paperwhite after reading perhaps a dozen novels on it. I expect to use it to read many more."
Mags SF,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently went back to a Kindle after reading on my phone using the Kindle app for several years. Between reading, social media, and news on my phone and the computer work that I do for a living, my aging eyes were tired and burning at the end of the day. But I love to read for 1-2 hours a day and wanted to both improve my reading experience and wean myself off mindless browsing on my phone. Going back to the Kindle has done wonders for my eyes (still working on that smartphone diet, though!) Eyestrain is greatly reduced at the end of the day. The paperwhite page is readable in all different light conditions, even when finishing up a chapter in the dark at bedtime. I have gotten great battery life from my Kindle; I only need to charge it about once a week, and that's while still having around 50% battery left. I have never once accidentally turned it off by touching the power button on the bottom. It's nowhere near my hand as I read. My only comment would be that sometimes the screen transitions (e.g., browsing my library, opening a new book) are a little slow, and sometimes I accidentally go back or forward several pages without meaning to, but those are both first world problems. All in all, I'm extremely happy to be back with a Kindle."
Monica,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Kindle after a long hiatus with Kindle Products. I have several Kindle ebooks that I've read on a Kindle Fire and -prior to this purchase- read via the Kindle App on my phone. The sole purpose for getting the Kindle Paperwhite was that it read ""like a real book,"" and I could eliminate the use of my phone (eliminating blue light and lessening screen time).

As a Kindle Paperwhite device, it looks sleek and is much lighter than I expected. It fits easily in my back pocket and charges quickly. The single complaint I have is that the touch screen portion reacts much more slowly than I would have hoped for it being the ""All New"" Kindle Paperwhite.

After digging around, I realized it was not in fact ""All New."" It is the 2018 release of the 10th Generation Kindle Paperwhite. Not the latest 2019 release. Perhaps the touch screen reaction lags are fixed in the 2019 version. But this 2018 ""All New Kindle Paperwhite"" definitely lags and goes in and out of the dark mode each time I tap on the screen. I am considering returning it .

Personally, I'd rather use the app on my phone. At least there, the reaction time is more stream lined, and tapping once doesn't trigger the dark mode. I know that the Oasis is probably the best in this line, but I didn't want to shell out $250+.

I felt a little Catfished with this Kindle (as it was older than I believed at first). I guess that's the thanks I get for being a loyal Amazon customer waiting for sales and hoping for the best. Perhaps in another 7 or 8 years I'll work up the nerve to try another Kindle Device."
Neil,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The one star review is for the info on the Amazon website being false. In two places on the web page it reports that the Kindle paper white has free cellular connectivity. It doesn't. We called Amazon tech support when we couldn't get that capability running and after a bunch of fits and starts they confirmed the capability isn't there and only exists on the Kindle Oasis for $120 more, but that's not what their the web page says."
J. Ajakh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older kindle white version and was frustrated with the design. I ended up buying books at the used book store again or reading off my phone through the kindle app. A few weeks ago while getting ready for a cruise vacation I saw Amazon had a trade in going with the purchase of a new kindle paper white. I saw that the new version is water proof and was a touch design verses the little push pad at the bottom. I knew my friend loved hers for reading in the bath and figured with the trade in it was worth trying.

I love it! I really like that it is waterproof. I don’t have to worry at the pool or if I want to read in the bath or if I get stuck out in the rain (yes it happened). My kindle tolerates splashes and raindrops. I love the touchscreen as well. The only thing that I find annoying and don’t know why it happens is the font size seems to change on its own. No clue what I’m doing to make that happen because it seems like it happens at random times. Other than that I think it’s a great way to read and the price is not outrageous. Allows me to bring a library of books I’ve chosen with me everywhere to read when I want depending on my mood or need. Cookbooks in the kitchen, mysteries on a rainy day, well you get the idea. I really am enjoying my new kindle paperwhite. Sure I only got the basic model but I got the extra memory to ensure my library comes with me everywhere I want it to. Glad I got to take advantage of the trade in offer as well. Thanks Amazon"
Joseph R. C.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Product update (10/23/2019): This is my second kindle paperwhite 10th edition because I had to send the other one back because of battery life and glitching. The battery life is phenomenal and I love the black smooth feeling in my hands. The only thing I would like to see different is the glare from other lights in the vicinity. The glass makes a glare. Even with the ""anti-glare"" screen protector there is still a glare. I would love to see the most up to date technology implemented on the best Amazon devices.

This is my second kindle paperwhite (last edition was the 7th gen.) At first I was not impressed at all. The color was an off color and was not very pretty to look at cosmetically. I couldn't tell what the color of it was and it changed when it was in the dark or in the light. The feeling of it was beautiful. I loved the feeling of it. I just wished I had ordered black. Fortunately for me the battery life was horrible so I ended up returning it. It would drop 5% without me using it. I had already downloaded all of the books so it wasn't downloading that dropped the battery life. I kept the kindle paperwhite about week until returning it. Also, the ads. Just pay a few extra $ and get rid of them...they lag the paperwhite and causes it to seem very glitchy."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The new kindle paperwhite is much like the older version, so if you like that one you’ll love this one! The screen is slightly more sensitive; after snoozing for a while it ‘wakes up’ before you can swipe to open and room there are now two size to choose from.
Due to the slightly small size the new paperwhite a new case will be needed and your previous power cords are no longer inter changeable as there is a slight difference in the size of the charging port.
Best kindle yet!"
N. Rivera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second kindle ever. I had one of the earlier kindles that still had arrow buttons and a keyboard. I had bought it because I was in a reading craze and thought in theory... yes! All my books in one place. But I think I had read two or three books and never picked it up again. Something about it didn’t allow me to fully immerse myself into a book for some reason.

THIS kindle tho... this one I love. I saw it at an amazon bookstore and was intrigued by its size and weight. It’s so incredibly easy to read a book on here. I bring it with me everywhere. And I like the option of turning on the backlight if I need to. I’ve only had it for a few weeks and I’ve read maybe 2.5 books and only charged it once. I. Love. It."
Mikeindc,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Update
After using the Kindle for a bit over a month I wanted to update my review. The button on bottom IS a problem. It was on the bottom on an old kindle and was not an issue. At least with the case I got, the cut outs are fairly big and the button is VERY sensitive to touch and it is easy to turn off. One very annoying characteristic is that the device actually shuts down after not being used for a while (haven't been able to figure out the cutoff, but its not long). This happens even when the cover is closed on the case rather the old where it always went into sleep mode. Not a huge deal, but it just means another couple of second delay in opening the device that is already slower than the old one. I was hoping that if the device actually shut off that battery life would be better, but I haven't seen any change. With light reading or in standby mode, battery life is a week or more. But if you are reading consistently it goes down to a day or two (10-14 hours of reading time). Generally at a brightness of about 18 out of 24 the screen is warmer than my old Kindle, but at full brightness it turns just as blue. The lighter weight is definitely noticeable unless you get a heavy duty case. It would nice if there was a ""to be read"" category for books to make it easy to find books that are on your list to read soon. This is sort of possible under ""categories"" but its just too complicated to do much.

Since my old kindle was having wifi issues and I did not want to have to depend on using usb to transfer books, I had no choice but to get a new device. But for the most part I liked my old kindle more.

Original review
Compared to my old Kindle (which was having wifi issues) the 2018 version 4th gen has some improvement compared to the 2013 2nd gen.
The screen is slightly warmer (though I see that some people complain of it being bluer so this may not be consistent within the devices) so reading is easier on your eyes. In addition, the back lighting is more even compared to my old 2013 version. But I really wish that the Kindle had the ability to invert the color so you had a bark screen with light text, for this reason (as well as the crisper text) I find that it is easier to read on a tablet, but then have to deal with the weight. Also wish that the brightness of the screen would auto adjust. I don't read much n a dark room or out in the sun, but when I do I need to manually adjust the brightness. As mentioned before, I find the text crisper on a tablet and slightly disappointed that text has not improved in sharpness (especially if make the text bold) much over the years on a Kindle. The screen is basically glare free.
The lack of raised bezels is nice, especially if that is where you rest your finger, but you now need to be very aware of where you are attempting to turn pages. It is disappointing that the bezel (black area around the screen) is still so large. You need some because you need to rest your finger somewhere, but would be nice if they were reduced slightly, especially at the top and bottom where you would never hold the device.
The water resistance is nice, but in the 7 years + I have been using a Kindle that has never been an issue, but I don't take to beach or the pool so this may mean a lot to some people.
The responsiveness is the same which means there is a slight lag when opening books or returning to the home page. It makes no sense, but books are staying queued for download longer than my 2nd gen model. I have only had the device 2 days, so this may be a fluke but I have attempted to download the same books on both devices and while the actual download time was the same, the queued time was about 2-3 seconds longer on the new version.
Be aware that it does NOT ship with a charger, just the cable (which is a nice heavy cable that looks to be durable). At this point most people probably have a charger laying around, but if not you will need to buy one. Some people have complained about the micro-usb plug being difficult. I have not found it to be any worse than any other micro usb which is to same it can be slightly difficult and it is hard to know which way to turn the plug.
The ""special offers"" are not at all annoying, especially since you can have the kindle default to opening to your list of books.
I was surprised that the device did not ship with the latest firmware. I was thinking about returning because the device had become unresponsive, but then got the notice that there was new firmware to install. So be aware that this may happen to you also.
If you are reading audio books (I don't and don't think I ever would), the increase to 8 GB may be important. I normally keep most of my books in the cloud and ""only"" about 200-300 on my device. I have never used more than 1 GB of storage (remember though that of the 8 GB the user only gets just over 6 as the rest is allocated to the O/S. If you download books with pictures they will greatly increase the size of the book, but you really don't want to look at pictures on a kindle.
I haven't had long enough to test battery life, but in previous version I have found that ""battery lasts weeks"" is not true if you are a heavy reader. I am sure that if you read audio books you should probably look at hours of battery life.
Some users have complained about the switch being on the bottom and turning on or off accidentally. I had this on my previous one also and don't find it an issue, especially once your get a case. Maybe their switch is more sensitive. I find the bigger problem to be, once you DO get a case that is can be hard to turn on.
The new kindle is lighter than the old one by about an ounce. Not much, but enough to notice if you are holding the Kindle. But if you get a heavy case, the weight of the device will be a small part of the total weight and the improvement in the device weight won't mean much.
Navigating to suggested books to read or buy is not bad, but if you have to try and find one its difficult, though not as much as the ""experimental browser"" which is painful beyond belief.
I see in the reviews that some people complain about the lack of ability to change font size or brightness. I think they are just not looking at the right menu options
I upgraded while Amazon was offering a special price for Prime members and a trade in for old devices. WIth this, I think the upgrade was worth it (the warmer screen is most important to me though others complain of the blue to the screen). I would not have upgraded at full price nor do I think its worth it unless you intend to read audio books (remember that battery life will decrease) or that the water resistance is important."
Ars Gratia Artis,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this product for reading books. Unfortunately, while there are features I do like, such as the glare free screen, there are features I detest. The old formatting, my library, including archived books, was easy to use and familiar. The new format is harder for me to read, a p.i.t.a to navigate and search. I loved the availability of the ""keyboard"" version. It was nice to be able to compose notes about spelling, grammar, syntax errors, formatting errors. Though the e-book formatting has improved, there are still many errors. I have lost track of how many times 'together' appears as 'to get her' in the text, as only one example. I purchased my current kindle when I lost my previous one. that one was several years old and still going strong, but this one, in under a year's time has suddenly lost the vast majority of its battery capacity. when new I could read frequently for over a week before getting a low battery message. Now, starting just this week, if I unplug the device from the charger at 9 AM I can read off and on until around 3 PM when I get a low battery message. One would expect Kindle devices to get better as the technology is used through the years, not worse. Very disappointed in this latest incarnation of the Kindle e-reader."
Christine,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
I love that the new paperwhite is waterproof since I read in the bath and sometimes get caught in the rain while reading outside. I, also, really like how the reader feels in my hands. It's very light weight and the size of the reader is not to big or to small. The built in lights are perfect for reading in low light or in the dark. I do appreciate being given the ability to change the font (size and shape) and the page layout to suit my own preferences.

Cons:
I find using audible on the paperwhite to be awkward and slow. I will continue to use my phone app or my fire tablet for audible. I, also, prefer using my fire tablet for searching for e-books in my library or in the store. It's faster and easier for me to navigate than the paperwhite.

Summary:
I really like the paperwhite to read books on. It feels good in my hands, is very easy on my eyes and I don't have to worry about it getting wet. For everything else (Audible, perusing my book library, shopping for books, etc) I prefer to use my phone app or my fire tablet."
magnolia mama,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an avid reader and love that I can now have a library in my handbag!
BATTERY 1 week at about 2 hours per day use with light at medium
PROS:
-Being able to adjust the font size allows me to read without glasses.
- Easy to turn pages forward
- Easy to read in bright light; the glare is comparable to a paper page

CONS:
- Font size cannot be adjusted on features such as dictionary
- Turning pages back is tricky"
KikiD26,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've never had a Kindle before but asked for one for Christmas so I didn't have to share the iPad anymore. I was surprised when I took it out of the box at how small and light it was. The size made me nervous at first but once I went through the start-up (which was quite easy since it was already linked to my Prime account) I was quickly on my way to my library and happy with most everything about it. The only thing I don't like is that even when it goes to sleep, or whatever you want to call it, there are still ads for other books, etc. It doesn't just shut the screen off. It wouldn't bother me but after just a couple weeks it seems like the screen might be etching a little. Even with the long read time I'd rather the screen just shut completely off. Other than that it is a wonderful little reader!"
Brian Luong,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was always skeptical about e-readers. I didn't like reading long articles or pdfs on my computer screen. But I gave in at the recommendation of a friend, bought a Kindle, and now I love it. The screen isn't the same as a computer screen. The screen is more muted than a computer which makes it feel like a real paper book. Downloading books is super easy. I've been going on Amazon.com on my computer to browse the bookstore and selecting books on that way. The books are then immediately downloaded onto my Kindle device without any more steps. Fantastic!

Battery life is great, I've read a few books on there and never had to think much about it running out of battery. Don't get me wrong, I have to charge it, but it's very infrequent."
S. Lowe,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sides are narrow so my finger keeps pressing the touch screen.
There are no page turn buttons, which I knew, but when I hold with my left hand I cannot tap, I have to swipe, it doesnt register or swipes two pages the wrong way so I spend time trying to find my place again.
The in screen light hurts my eyes so I have to wear blue light filter glasses to read. My previous device I used a book light but there is nowhere to fasten this one on the case.
With wi-fi off and the light at 1 or off, the battery has gone down 15% in four days. It went down full battery on wi-fi in about a week, from when I activated it until I did the first charge. So it doesnt last as long as advertised but longer than my keyboard, which is expected since it's a newer device.
I really struggled with leaving this review but this has been the saddest purchase I've ever made on Amazon and all in all, I am extremely disappointed.

Plus I bought it on black friday so theres no way to get the discounted price on the Oasis (to go to the next version which I would have bought had I known I wouldn't like the paperwhite) and I traded my keyboard version so I have to repay the trade-in certificate if I return this one."
Arcadia D,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So unlike other reviews, the battery life does not seem to be an issue for me. I actually haven't had to charge it since I got it, and I've already completed two books with 44% battery remaining.

My biggest gripe is the dang power button!! What idiot thought that would be a good location? If you read books the old fashioned way (portrait not landscape) your right pinkie will bump into the power button all of the time. It drives me mad. It's so slow to power back up.

I upgraded to this from my 2014 Gen 6 Paperwhite. Other than the waterproof and bluetooth feature I'll probably never use, there was ZERO point to ""upgrading."" It's the same everything. And still ungodly slow to load things in the store or sometimes even to flip the page."
Mickey,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first touch Kindle Reader. I have been using the original 5 button Kindle for years. I love its battery life.
I can easily read 3 or more books between chargers. This Kindle Whitepaper I can't even read one. I have a portable charge bank handy because in the middle of a book I might get ""your battery is low"" screen and it drives me crazy.
I think part of the problem is you don't really turn the Kindle off, you just can turn the screen off. With the old Kindle, you could turn it off at night or when you were not going to read for days. I do like that you can adjust the
size & types of print, screen light level, etc and that it is the same size as my older Kindle. There is a lot to like in the Whitepaper, but its battery life is not good. I have done everything I can think of, turning the brightness down, disconnecting in from WiFi, etc. I think I should have waited a little longer until Amazon corrected this problem before I bought it.
Update Just got 2 days of reading and that message about my battery is low showed up. Really - 2 days? I am going back to using my 5 button Kindle. I will keep the Paperwhite but it is a real disappointment. No more ""new"" Kindles for me."
Kricket,4.0 out of 5 stars,I'm so happy to be able to read outside this summer. I have a problem with my hands and I can no longer hold a book for any length of time. I love to read and spend most of my time with my tablet but I can't see it to read outside. A few summers ago I could still use my hands well enough to read from a book for periods of time and enjoyed taking one with me when my dad took us for a boat ride and when I went with the kids to the beach or the pool. Last summer I didn't do any of these things. This summer I will be right there with my family. My only complaint with the Paperwhite is that when you put it in landscape mode it only goes one way. I have not been able to find one case that works to prop it up in landscape mode without it being upside down. Because I need the case to prop up the Paperwhite to allow me to enjoy reading this is very frustrating. The Paperwhite has to go in the case the wrong way to have the writing the correct direction but then you can't charge it without having to take it back out. I struggle with getting it in and out of cases and because I spend most of my time reading I find that after a couple of days I don't have enough battery life to get through a third day. This wouldn't be a big deal but i can't charge it while reading because I haven't found a case that will allow me to prop it up at the same time the charger is plugged into the ereader. This is a problem with a case that props it up in portrait mode also. I'm using this type of case now because at least I don't have to remove it from the case to charge it. I know it might be easier for someone to create a case for the disabled users but it would be even better if you put the charging port on the right side of the tablet and changed the direction of the landscape mode that way it won't be poking the stomach of the person who is using it in a case that opens like a book or won't stand up in a case in portrait mode. It would also take the pressure off the power cord and likely make them last longer. These are just my ideas to make the next generation the best one yet and give people who have working Paperwhites a good reason to buy a new one.
DSullinger,2.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: I changed my 5 star to a 2 star. The Bluetooth us a problem in this device. Every time I close the lid it disconnects from the bluetooth, which is fine, but when I turn it back on it won’t connect. I’ve tried different bluetooth devices (headsets, speakers and a Beats Pill II), it does it to all of them. I have to restart the Kindle and then it connects. It see’s the devices, ask if I want to forget or connect. Ive tried both and the same issue but as soon as I restart the Kindle, I can go into bluetooth and it will connect. I shouldn't have to restart it every time I want to use bluetooth. This is a fail on Amazons behalf.

I upgraded my Kindle PaperWhite to the latest version to get the VoiceView Reader option under Accessibility. I purchased an inexpensive bluetooth headset from Amazon. Connected Bluetooth headset to the new Kindle, went into Settings, then Accessibility and turned on VoiceView Reader. You have to remember to double-tap options once it is on, but it works fantastic. It reads books great and I can understand her great. I've completed more books now that I've upgraded to the new Kindle PaperWhite. It also holds double the books. I'm so happy and love it. This is also the first time I've emailed a book to it. Love the option. Amazon paid me for my old Kindle and got an extra $25 for upgrading, so it was a great price all the way around. Thanks Amazon! Worth the upgrade. Just do it, you will love it."
Alligator Jones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Want to listen to audiobooks AND read along with the book you purchased? Well, too bad! It cannot do both at the same time! Backing out of the audiobook stops playback.

That is literally the only reason I bought this product. If I wanted to use my phone to read or listen, I could have done so already, without buying a new Paperwhite. I sold my Paperwhite 3 to my roommate and I want it back. Also making it 2mm thinner means I can't use my Amazon offical cases, that were pretty expensive compared to third party cases, on this one.

Battery life is also pretty bad, even with airplane mode on. Light use for 2 days and it was at 50%.

If you don't have a paperwhite already, this is a fine purchase. If you own a previous model, there is no reason to upgrade unless you like to read in the rain."
RJay,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, you can enlarge the print to virtually any size BUT the graphics at the top of the unit are tiny so every time you want to increase the print size or brightness or any other graphic decision, you need your glasses or a magnifying glass if your vision is really bad...and those with bad vision are among those who choose the kindle."
Cathy M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love having tons of books available esp when I am outdoors and by the pool or beach and I can actually read. I traded in my old Kindle Paperwhite I had since 2013. The battery stopped holding a charge, but the Kindle worked fine. I am not sure if a battery can be replaced easily, but for the cost, I feel like the battery lasted a pretty long time. I had to call tech support because the screen froze initially, but it was trying to download my old library. I had to hold the button down for 40 seconds. The tech emailed me the information. I would have preferred to have that info before, but either way, it worked and my old library is back. I gave the battery 5 stars, but that was based on the long-life claim. I will update that later. I hope this one lasts as long as the last one or longer. I love the new blue color. It goes beautifully with my previous Vera Bradley Kindle cover. So far so good! I hope when my old Kindle arrives, I get better credit for it. That would be the biggest disappointment to only get a $5 credit for the old one. All it needs is a new battery. I did get a discount as well, but you can get $5-25 credit for an old one, and mine had been protected always. Will see what happens."
Mandi,5.0 out of 5 stars," I used to read a lot in my youth and recently wanted to get back to old habits. I decided to purchase a device that would allow me to carry multiple books at once.

Originally I ordered the Kinde Fire but actually returned it (without even opening the box) and opted for the paperwhite due to a sale. At first I was nervous. Why would I pay more money for a device that technically did less? It ended up being one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.

Not having apps actually results in me reading more. When reading on my iPad or phone I get distracted by notifications and social media and find it hard to focus. The paperwhite takes these distractions away.

This thing also has a battery that lasts weeks depending on your use, the WiFi being enabled and the light. In addition the the rocking battery it also is waterproof (yay pool time) and is very easy on the eyes (iPad used to hurt my eyes while reading) due to the e ink. I have personally found that turning pages isn’t even that slow (which was a fear of mine).

As a heads up, it is a bit smaller than expected (picture with pen provided for reference) but I actually find this nice. The kindle fits in my small purse easily and doesn’t hardly weigh anything at all.

Just do yourself a favor and buy this already. You won’t regret it."
Mike Reynolds,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an avid reader and have had a few different kindles since the original.

I had been using a Kindle Oasis 1st generation and while I really did love it, I was always paranoid around water with it. I live in the Pacific Northwest and often find myself reading outside when I might get a drop of rain or two. I decided to purchase the Paperwhite instead of upgrading to the new waterproof Oasis.

I am very impressed that even with fewer backlights on it, the screen is lit perfectly in any amount of light.

The only beefs that I have with the kindle in 2019:

1. The screen is not quite as responsive as you would hope. I don't have the biggest hands/fingers in the world, but I am surprised how often I struggle to highlight the sentence, phrase or paragraph accurately.

2. I feel like the battery life is less than I would expect. I previously owned the Kindle Oasis 1st gen and it held a charge really well and had a battery in the case that charged it even further. I recently was surprised after only using the paperwhite for a few days that the battery was surprisingly low. I normally leave the device in airplane mode, so I was a little surprised that the battery was as low as it was.

While those might sound like gripes, I really love this device. I am surprised that it feels like an upgrade over the Oasis which cost considerably more when it was released. I actually like the feel more than the oasis, I find that I like a little bit of a bezel for my hand to rest on.

I also love the official Kindle Case that I purchased alongside the device. It looks and feels great and surprisingly makes the device even more comfortable to hold."
Sarrah,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated Review: After using the new kindle for several months, I have realized the audible feature is virtually useless. It takes 10 minutes to get it to connect to any kind of blue tooth device other than my Echo. Add on to that, getting the text to speech started is an added ordeal that is just not worth the effort. I like it for bedtime reading because the back lit is great and poolside reading because I don't have to worry about a few splashes of water. If you are buying this for the audible functionality, don't.

The set up of the features is completely different from the Kindle App and my other kindle devices so it is frustrating to try and find a simple command like SYNC to furthest page read because its under a different menu. It would have been nice had this had some uniformity to the Kindle App I am familiar with on all my other Kindle devices.

Original Review: I absolutely love this kindle! I have had almost every kindle model that has come out since the very first, white kindle with the key board (think I got that one in 2006). I have always loved the paper-white but I use the kindle fire for the audible and to connect to my car stereo to listen to my books on long drives. Now I don't have to switch between kindles because this one has it all!!
The back-lit screen is perfect for reading at night without interrupting my husbands sleep, the blue tooth connection to enable audible/text to speech is fabulous! And I have less concern about laying by the pool to read because if a little water splashes on it, no problems!
Great Job, Amazon! This is the best E-reader!"
Tim O.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Since I have no use for audibles and managed not to drop my previous kindle in the tub while reading this isn't really an upgrade...but the various deals made it a almost free to upgrade so why not.

The flatter screen is still protected by a (now very tiny) lip so you won't get scratches by just putting it down. That said, I don't find any advantage to the flatter front on this kindle vs previous.

Two annoying things:
- Why isn't this USB-C? Really Amazon. Get with it - there's no excuse for sticking with micro-USB
- Why does my kindle need to 'wake up' for a few seconds every time I turn it in? The old one didn't so this is an overall minor, but majorly stupid step backwards."
Ian S,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So I think the fact that it is a touchscreen is pretty important to mention in the product highlights. It totally changes the way I can use it and that is not what I was looking for. First of all, I wanted a waterproof kindle so that I can read in the spa, but since it is touchscreen, I can't wipe off the water without changing the font size. Unlike my old Kindle I can't just put it into a seat pocket or throw it in my backpack without locking it, so I will have to develop new habits and break old ones. Since the margins are fairly small and I have average size man hands, it can be hard to handle and pick up without accidentally turning a page. Another thing I don't like is that the actual reading surface is recessed well below the glass so it creates a lot of refraction when water droplets get on the screen and makes it harder to read. They say it is the lightest yet, but it is noticeably heavier than my old kindle, so I guess they are just straight up lying on that claim and hoping no one notices? it is also much slower than my old Kindle. it takes longer to turn pages, and browsing my library and returning to the home screen have noticeable delays, which my old kindle does not. Not sure how they are moving backward after 5 years. Some of the changes that the touchscreen brings are easy to appreciate, like having a full keyboard for logging into wifi, but again it is not what I was looking for and I can't believe they would fail to mention something that important so I will be returning it and sticking with my beat up 5-year old Kindle which is superior in nearly every way."
Charles Kee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a replacement for a paperwhite which finally quit after lasting much longer than I ever expected. I got the model with extra memory, but I think most people would be happy with the default memory as it still holds an incredible number of books. I use this in preference to the Fire 8 (which I use only for books with color content) because of the longer battery life. It holds my library of books I plan to read. I have even been slowly replacing the paper copies on my shelf with electronic copies because of the convenience and to save space on my shelves. While this model is thinner than the older one, I do not think of this as a significant advantage as the older one was thin enough for practical usage. I am having to train myself not to let my thumb rest on the black frame as I have had unexpected page change from getting too close to the page. It would also be nice if the process of replacing an older version were simplified - like an option to automatically download the content that was on the model being replaced. It took a while to scroll through my library to select the books I needed to download. Some way to prioritize the books I plan to read next so that they appear earlier in the library would also be nice. While my first impulse would be to prefer a larger screen, I rarely find that this would be helpful, and the screen size is advantageous for portability. Also, a larger screen would introduce the inconvenience of losing my place when moving the gaze to the beginning of the next line from the right side - thus slowing reading speed."
Robert Hamilton,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had 4 other Kindles since the brand launched: OG, Keyboard, PW1 & PW3. The 2018 Paperwhite (PW4) is by far my favorite. Previously, my fave was the Kindle Keyboard. Loved that thing, loved the hand feel and loved the screen. When I upgraded to the Paperwhites, something was always off to me. The screen lights were uneven, the screens were further recessed from the casing which made them dust and debris magnets, the touch controls never felt right.

And there’s one nitpick that always got to me with the previous PWs — the light would never turn off completely. Even at its lowest setting (furthest to the left it can go) the light was always on, though dim, and slightly washed out the screen. I prefer no backlight while reading, and since the PWs have the nicest screens of the cheaper Kindle offerings I’ve been stuck with them (entry Kindles aren’t as sharp or contrasty).

But finally, the new Paperwhite addresses my 2 main concerns. The screen is no longer recessed and the light can now be completely turned off! This may seem minor to some, but it’s a huge deal to me. The flush screen, naturally lit from an external source, is gorgeous. And if I do turn the light on, it evenly lights the screen and you can no longer see where the LEDs are. The screen is the most important part of an e-reader and this one is exceptional.

My only gripes are that the software is identical, and identically sluggish, to the previous model, and that the touch controls still aren’t great. Page turns don’t always register and take longer than they should, and long presses to highlight aren’t especially precise. Also, the battery drains pretty fast with WiFi on compared to previous models. That said, the PW4 is my new favorite Kindle. Give it a go if the flush screen (or ability to completely cut the light off) is important to you; honestly not worth upgrade if it’s not — the screen and software are identical otherwise, and the battery isn’t as good."
Gregory F. Pfister,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a replacement for my 2nd generation paperwhite. That's approximately the 2nd Gen; it was whatever the number is for the first one with a background light. I don't remember the number. This is mainly a review of the differences I perceive with the new one.

I really like it.

The light is far more uniform, and seems brighter, but the brightness might be an illusion; I don't know.

The better resolution lets me use a smaller font and still read it without reader glasses, which is a big deal for me. And: the image display of book covers is can actually be used, instead of showing little more than a set of muddy blobs.

It's also much more responsive to touches on the screen. Not overly so - I don't pop multiple pages forward (well, usually :-)), but faster to do its thing, whatever was requested. Entering text is much easier, but I don't do that very often so not a big deal. The layout of settings and options is possibly better, but I could get everything I needed done before.

My wife, who also replaced her 2nd Gen with this, is like ""Meh."" She said she doesn't notice any difference. So not everybody will see, or need, the improvements.

I don't say anything about waterproofing because that's not an issue with either of us. Nor is the display being flush with the case.

Overall, I'm happy with the upgrade. I like it! But not everybody will feel it's worth upgrading."
Vortex,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was dissapointed in this device. I have a neuro muscular disease and surprisingly there was no autoscroll feature. The amount of force needed to 'turn' the page might be trivial to some people but exhausting for me. Holding the device was also too tiring as compared to my cell phone. I found that my smart phone kindle app is easier to manually turn pages because i can adjust sensitivity or autoscroll if things are really bad. I wish amazon would consider a smaller form factor, slightly less bevel and the option to adjust sensitivity and autoscroll. It is a good device for anyone who isnt suffering from disability. I returned the device and cant speak to battery life."
FourBoysMom,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointing upgrade, in fact it was not an upgrade at all. I had a previous paperwhite. I read the features of the ""newest"" model and decided to upgrade during Prime Days. The real upgrades? Well, it says it's waterproof, no plans to test that and it was not really something I cared about. Battery not as advertised. Reading 4-6 hours/day, I have to recharge a minimum of every other day; definitely not the ""weeks"" advertised. I turned off the wifi, it's not too bright, but the battery lasts maybe even a little less than my old one. Does have more memory but that wasn't critical for me as I usually delete the books after I read them, some I may keep for a while, but not 8GB worth for sure.
Overall it is okay but not the upgrade/improvements advertised and I was expecting. I did get a three month subscription to Kindle UnLimited which I would not have paid for as I think it is very overpriced. Did not like that I could not choose when that subscription started which is why I have been reading so much. I would have preferred to save for the colder months.
If you just want to do a little upgrade and you don't mind spending the money, then it's fine. Should you consider it so much an upgrade to go buy now - no. I did get a trade-in so that reduced my overall cost. But if you're happy with your current model, stick with it. Honestly, I wish they would come up with a slightly larger model, maybe a little grip point and better lighting, those would be upgrades for me."
Gabo Palacios,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As an avid book reader I thought this was a good option, now that I am unable to move boxes of books around. I had an Ipad before and I read a lot on the computer. That said I think this kindle is ok. The inability to change fonts for pdf render it annoying. So it kinda forces one to the not so impresive selection of books from the amazon store. That one month trial of ebooks is also pretty sad regarding the selection of books and authoras. I've struggled finding the philosophers which is the damn reason I bought this in the first place. Even some classics are hars to find and don't even mention foreign books that I could easily pick up at the bookstore.
The device response to swiping is flickery and slow, which really annoys me. The publicity it shows when in sta dby mode is intrusive and silly.
The blue color is pastel and not shinny. The battery life is def not weeks as advertised unless you turn off lights and wifi (which are the good things about this model Lol). All in as an alternative to books kindle fails. As a novelty to read some of the new hyped authora and avoid boxes of books is ok I guess. Now for the price I should've stayed with paper :/ oh well"
Mario,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have an older kindle and you're still happy with it, there's no real reason to get this one unless you want the waterproof version. It's a good kindle, the light is way more uniform than the previous Paperwhites, and my screen doesn't have any pinhole bright spots or dead pixels but my previous paperwhites did. It's annoying to have a lack of USB-C, but I'm sure they'll announce a new kindle with USB-C a week after I bought mine. It also feels lighter than any previous kindle I've used, which was a little disorienting at first because the thing is so weightless. Overall, it's a good reading device but hard to recommend an upgrade if you have a functional kindle already"
David,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far my Kindle operates flawlessly. Audible sounds is very clear. Bluetooth was very easy to sync to my headset. I have 28 audible books and 200 books downloaded. With 618mb free in storage. You may need to go 32gb if you have more audible books you wish to download. I keep a few Audible books in the cloud.

The text is clear and easy to read. The different fonts and texts size with bold makes reading a delight.

The battery performs great even though I have Bluetooth and wireless on when listening to Audible. Book pictures look much better at 300 resolution than my previous 212.

I have a Fire 7th generation that has also performed flawlessly however the Paperwhite is a need for outdoor reading. It is lighter and easier to read for the eyes than the Amazon Fire Device. Knowing now that I can backpack it in the rain is a very good selling point with me.

It was money well spent."
Mysticalwaters1,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this coming from using nook for years. I love the feel of the nook the rubbery texture however the last nook glowlight the software was super super super slow and glitchy. Eventfully froze and completely unusable. However I ADORED the orange light. So much better for relaxing and easy for eye strain. I finally jumped ship to kindle due to the software glitches. Good device responsive and gets the job done. I have to have a light however not having the orange light really upsetting. Especially since all their fires and the oasis have it now. I enjoy having a light to read but it’s so white it actually gives me headaches. I have the setting really low but the orange light would be ideal. I’m not liking the feeling the touch of the back and sides. I like a rubbery soft comfortable texture. Could have been fixed with a case but have not been able to find one like it. The menus fonts are too small for me. Battery life initially I thought was awful but after having it fully setup and downloading my huge collection it finally settled and can last a couple weeks for me. So works decent but adding an orange light larger font and better feel would have made it amazing!
kkkms,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using the kindle reader app on my iphone and ipad for years, the drawback being iphones have short battery life, so I was using up my battery reading, and my ipad is big and bulky and difficult to see when sitting in the sunlight. So when I heard there was a waterproof kindle paperwhite, I decided to add another device to my collection.

Here's what I like: the weight of the paperwhite, the battery life (I recharge after every book and have plenty of battery left), I can easily read indoors or outdoors in any light, its waterproof (although I haven't tried that out yet), I no longer need to bring 1000 pages of books with me on vacation, it's all right here in this small device (yes!)

Here's what I don't like: I am used to the functionality of the kindle app and the paperwhite is missing several handy features which I used often 1) no color, I sometimes highlight in multiple colors, can't do that here; 2) It sometimes loses it's place and there is no feature to go to the last page read (it will show you the last chapter, then you need to find your way) - I find this extremely frustrating; 3) My hands are smaller and I find I can't comfortably hold the device in one hand, I need to use two hands (again, frustrating); 4) When I do hold the device with both hands I tend to hit the off button on the bottom - a LOT, I am constantly turning off and having to turn back on again while reading (can be several times per chapter (incredibly frustrating, why is the on button not on the top of the device?)

So while I will muddle through with this device, I look forward to some improvements."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned the original Kindle Paperwhite and took advantage of the trade-in to upgrade. My original Paperwhite was slowing down and I will admit that I liked the idea of a waterproof device. My favorite part of the new one is that it is faster, with a larger storage capacity so I can download Audible books and not need my phone. I took it with me on vacation and loved every moment reading on it.

I have 2 complaints:
1) The device did not record the actual date that I finished the books during my vacation, so when I returned home from my wi-fi-less trip abroad and it synced, it communicated to GoodReads that I finished seven books on January 1, 2020 instead of the various dates in December. I can, of course, edit these in GoodReads, but it seems lame that the Paperwhite can't share that information properly.

2) Even on airplane mode, the battery seems to be used much more quickly than my original Paperwhite. That may be because it has an extra LED light, but I'm not sure. I keep mine on airplane mode unless I know that I need to sync my current location to the cloud.

Overall, I am very pleased with my new Paperwhite."
Alena,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this new version because the battery in the last model started to swell. I think that was because of the outlet not the kindle. But anyways, this new one is a decent replacement. The battery life is comparable. I read a lot, like 8 hours a day sometimes and I only charge it once a week or so when I notice the battery is low. I don't ever use the backlight and I leave wifi on and don't really think about it. I wish it came in white I think that the screen blends better that way. The screen has a bit of glare, but still less than a phone or something. I got rid of most of it with an anti-glare screen protector. The touch screen is not the most responsive - nothing like a phone but that's kind of to be expected for a device like this. Even so, I think it could be better.

My biggest complaint: WHY IS THE POWER BUTTON ON THE BOTTOM?
I really hate that. I accidentally press it all the time when I'm propping the kindle up or even with my hand just holding it. I also can't really charge it while I'm using it because of this but thankfully I don't need to charge often enough that it's really annoying.

Amazon please put the power button on the top in future models or at least have the ability to flip everything upside-down."
Karen P,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated 7/16/19– drop from 5 to 4 stars. Unfortunately after having it for two months my kindle was losing battery within hours and I contacted product support because the self help steps didn’t allow me to get past the opening page. I luckily got approved to have a tech review it and ended up shipping my kindle to them and per an automated email the software was updated and the device was reset and they shipped it back. I’ve only had it a short time but it’s behaving just a bit differently for the better. It seems faster, like page turns are super quick (turning multiple pages if I’m not quick tapping) and the wake feature is automatically happening vs using the touch button, I love this. That said, if this device again starts to lose charge quickly I think I’m looking for an alternate eReader since battery power is a simple basic requirement. I’m completely hooked on a device that is small and doesn’t get hot in the sun! *** For those that are having difficulty, a system update may solve the problems you’ve been having; if the email I got is to be believed and I’m believing right now :)

I decided to upgrade from 7th generation due to the waterproof feature since I generally have this with me on our boat plus the flat edge and extra storage, etc. I am all about apple products but kindle has the corner on the readability in sunlight and without getting hot! It’s frustrating to be outside and holding a super hot iPad when all you want is to get absorbed in a book. Love this kindle! And it does actually fit my 7th gen case - just snug up the Velcro— Fintie Folio Case for Kindle Paperwhite"
Natalia,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s a nice upgrade from the Kindle 8th gen. I like the light and how you can adjust it but as usual the battery is disappointing and does NOT last for weeks as advertised even with minimal use and dim lighting.

Few more things:
1. I hate that Amazon removed the option to link to your Facebook account and be able to share quotes from the book to Facebook. I don’t know what that’s about but it sucks.

2. When you upload your documents via USB, the people/family who are supposed to have access to your content won’t get them on their kindle device. So, you would have to email them to the kindle email in order for them to view them. That’s pretty inconvenient and could’ve been made better but I don’t know why they didn’t make the effort to simplify things for the users.

3. The back gets easily scratched. I had mine for a few days and I’m very careful with my things but it already has a lot of scratches. So I was forced to buy a kindle cover to protect the back. The material of the back also attracts a lot of dirt and it’s hard to remove.

4. It is slightly bigger, not by much, from the previous kindle (8th gen). That’s a good thing. It’s also thinner. Not much difference in weight.

5. I find the material of the device generally poor quality. Like I said, I’m very careful in handling my electronic devices and it already has a small chip at the base even though I never dropped or bumped it plus it already has a case.

Overall, I expected this product to be a lot sturdier than what it is for $100+ item. Haven’t tried the water resistant feature as I’m not very confident about its construction by the looks and feel of it plus the chipping that already occurred for no reason."
Mh1023,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has chosen to focus completely on it's Kindle Unlimited service and ignore everything else. Really, the only thing you can do with a Kindle is pay $10 per month for unlimited access to bunch of books that nobody wants to read or vastly overpay for new releases."
iPad mama,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third paperwhite and I plan to exchange it as it may be defective, but enough use for me to review. The screen needs to “wake up” before you can swipe to turn it on. No other paperwhite require this 10-second “wake up” and the screen is very bright and not at the level you’ve set it to be. So on a dark room, that “wake up” screen is annoyingly bright.

Mine has a charging issue. It’s been charging all night long with the battery indicating the charging symbol but only at 30%. So I’m returning for that defect, but the complaint is that the battery life seems much shorter than my other two versions of paperwhites. The last version (the white case which I loved) seemed to go for at least two weeks of reading before needing to be charged. This one is a week max. I don’t know if that is a also a defect associated with the “charging” defect I’ve identified, or if the battery life is reduced due to the audible capabilities or.. who knows. Just not an improvement for me.

The fonts and screen quality seem the same to my eyes, I love the waterproof feature (which is why I upgraded) but so far only the waterproof feature seems to be an improvement. I actually preferrred the “edge” along the screen so that I didn’t accidentally turn the page while reading, so the flush screen is not an advantage to me personally. Overall, I love paperwhite a but this version is not my favorite."
JennyWanna,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm in love with my Paperwhite. I've had one for years and it's seriously my favorite thing ever. When I saw an ad for the waterproof version I knew I needed that because I read in the bath *all the time*. Up until now I just have used quart sized Ziploc bags over the Kindle but I'm always paranoid that I'll drop it or water will get in somehow. I have weak hands due to some disabilities and I live in fear that I'll ruin my Paperwhite that way.

Oh and also, I've put two popsockets on the back of my Paperwhite to help my poor hands out a little bit (life changing hack right there! Seriously try it! I used two so I can hold it either with my left or right hand while lying down, AND I can wedge my fingers in between the two to hold it that way if I want) but I can't use them with a Ziploc bag over it. Anyway, a waterproof Paperwhite is a dream come true for me!"
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I want to love this Kindle, but I don't. I have been using the 4th generation Kindle for many years and it finally gave out on me. I feel this one is inferior to the older models on several ways. First, the glare on the screen is terrible. If you have a light source or window behind you, forget it. The screen is not nearly as crisp as my 4th gen. The fingerprints are terrible on this screen. It is much more difficult to get to your library of books through all the advertisements and buying screens. Waterproof? Yeah right. Not recommended for salt water, chlorinated water or mineral water. So I guess it can only be in the bathtub or a lake. There are a few positives...the touch screen is more responsive than my previous version, and it comes in a pretty blue color. I do appreciate that I can access my KindleUnlimited from the kindle now (I couldn't do that with the 4th gen). The back light is nice and the brightness can be adjusted, however the brighter it goes, the less crisp the writing becomes."
CATCRAW,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th Kindle. Most recently upgraded from Paperwhite 7th gen (2015 model). I have been debating on this upgrade and finally decided to take advantage of the trade in promotion. My first impressions of the new Paperwhite, I like the size and weight, it was noticeable. Other than the improved specs, waterproof, storage, bluetooth, audio, I really like the flush screen. I did not think it would make that big of a difference, but it does. It really improved the lighting. On the 7th gen you could see the 4 lights shining up from the bottom of the screen. On the new Paperwhite you do not see the lights at all, giving the appearance that the screen is uniformily backlit. The touch screen reacts smoothly and I do like the new feel of the screen. I cannot comment on the battery life yet, as I have not had it long enough to compare to that of the gen 7. I purchased the leather cover and it fits pretty well. I like that they made that lighter as well. So no regrets with my decision to upgrade, although not an earth shattering difference from gen 7, there are enough new features and improvements to make the upgrade well worth it."
Dean Grant Jr.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had my new Paperwhite for a little over a week now and I like it. It works well, and does everything like it should. Couple of items I thought I would mention

- 8 gb of storage is deceiving. The OS is larger than my previous Voyage; I presume this is because of Audible and Bluetooth support. I have just two or 3 books on mine, and I have 27gb free out of 32gb; the OS must be taking up the lions share of the space. 8gb seems like it is more space but for practical purposes, it's not. But I had hundreds of books on my old Voyage with 4gb and plenty of room left, so it's certainly functional.You're not cramped, just not as much space as it sounds.

- The delay when warming up is only when you flip the cover. Pressing the button manually is much quicker. My speculation is that the delay is built in for the cover on, so that if jostled in motion it doesn't power on/off constantly, like my Voyage used to. That can't be good for the electronics.

- Thank goodness the page flip buttons are gone. Now you can hold it without accidentally turning the page

- Every other device in the world centers the power socket, here it is offset. That's really odd

All in all it's a good ereader. The delay on warm-up I am getting used to, I understand the practicality of it now I have to adjust. Thumbs up on this one"
Have2Read,3.0 out of 5 stars,"SECOND UPDATE: Okay, I am now thoroughly used to this version of Kindle. It is OK. The charge issue that I complained about is actually satisfactory and plugging in/out to charge the device is not as difficult. But, I do want to comment that this device's bottom section should be broader (see photos of my new and old devices) as my old Kindle was. More depth would hinder fingers slipping onto the screen--which then changes the location indicator/time remaining notification. (I love that feature, especially to determine ""can I finish this book before bedtime, or???) Finally, a suggestion: put the charging plug and on/off switch at the top of the device. Why, you ask? Because, if you are like me and read with the Kindle resting on a pillow, you can accidentally turn the device on or off if you move wrong. (Plus, and this is just me, my cats like to cuddle beside me and I have pulled many a long kitty hair out of the socket!) ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is so much less satisfactory to my prior Kindle Paperwhite, which, after 4 years of steady use, gave up the ghost. As so many have noted, this model's charger cable is difficult to plus in and out (note to y'all: I had another Kindle that was difficult to plug in/out which died after less than a year of life. I'm not sure if the two issues are connected [see what I did there? LOL] but it's worth noting). The contrast is also less satisfying (to me, at least) and more difficult to get where I want it. What can I say? It does the job, but, not to the standard I was hoping for. UPDATE on 3/9/19: I have had this for less than a month and, already, it is losing it's charge very quickly. After 2 hours of reading, my device was down to 80% charge--from 100%. That is excessive. When I first used the device, a chunk of reading time such as this would not take even 10% of a charge. From 3 stars to 2 in less than a month."
Theresa S.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 5th Kindle. I have literally worn out most of them. One was stolen. I enjoy having a kindle that is lighter to hold and sealed for water exposure. I like how the screen is now solid when I swipe from page to page. The battery length time is grossly overstated in the Amazon advertisement for this new Kindle. Even though it now has a “waking up’ feature to save battery life, it doesn’t last much longer than my previous kindles. Not a big concern for me. Not finding this kindle as a big improvement over the others. But I love my kindle devices so I continue to purchase them."
Ree86,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had the regular kindle and the kindle fire and then mostly read on my kindle apl on my phone. I found myself missing using a kindle device. After doing heavy research I decided i'll try the kindle paperwhite. I've head it for a couple of weeks and here are my thoughts.
Battery- it lasts about two weeks for me mostly because I read at night and use the backlight. I imagije this contributes to batt drain.
Weight- it is very light. Even with my case I find it comfortable to hold with one hand.
Power button- I read that some users had an issue on where it is placed but I have never had a problem it could be my case provides a buffer so that the button never gets accidentaly pushed.
I think I got the option with offers and so far i don't even notice it. They're mostly when my kindle is on lock screen so I don't see what the fuss is about."
Time For Lunch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"On Prime Day I upgraded my almost 10 year old Generation 3 Kindle (with the keyboard) to the smaller and lighter Paperwhite Kindle. This new Kindle is pretty awesome! It is SO small and lightweight. The screen is excellent whether I am in a low-light area or outside in the bright sun. It is so easy to throw in my purse and take it with me, even with the case on it, it still isn’t bulky.

I opted for the “without special offers” version because I do not want to be bothered with the ads. That option is a bit deceiving so I almost bought the other one because I thought I was getting a better price for some promo, I didn’t realize that it meant I would have pop-up ads for the duration. No thanks!

It is easy to adjust the brightness if I need, which hasn’t been often. I’m getting older and now I need larger font and this was easy to make that happen. It does take a little getting used to initially (for me anyway) but once I got a feel for things, it has been pretty easy to operate. Easy enough to download books directly from Amazon on the Kindle as well .

I have gotten this wet by the pool, with a case and screen protector on it, and it didn’t have any issues. The charge seems to hold pretty well and it is quick to charge back up when plugged in.

I am including some pictures just for folks who may want to compare sizes to an older Kindle like my previous one (the 3rd generation with the keyboard). You can see in the photos that the screen is about the same size but so much less bulk overall with the new Kindle!"
Mishae,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love books, but I tiny live (like fulltime RV, less than 400sqft!). I'm the type of girl who likes to physically hold a book when I read. I tried an Amazon Kindle Fire in college, it was great (digital copies of textbooks were cheaper) but after college slowly stopped using it as much. I decided to get the paperwhite (even though I have an Ipad and old kindle fire) because it was smaller and lightweight and, I'm running out of room to store books and I have a hard time getting rid of books. So far I love the Paperwhite. I didn't realize just how compact and lightweight it would be but that's definitely a positive thing for me. The battery life lasts forever and I don't get tired of holding it after a while. I will definitely still be buying hard copies of some books, but for my fiction books, I think I'll try to stick to the kindle. It has also been great for traveling. On top of traveling fulltime, I also take many small trips without my RV. Before the Paperwhite, half my purse or bag was taken up by 2-4 books (yes, I read several books at once). Now I can grab one hardcopy book and my kindle and be set for a weekend or week-long trip."
ShoeBlossom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first Kindle and I am so glad I got it. It is like having your own personal bookstore wherever you go! I recommend paying the $20 to get the ads removed. I did it after several days of purchase.

Negatives: Previous page button! Sometimes I like to go back to the previous page in the book and when I do it jumps to the next page! To my understanding, if you click lower left side it should go to previous page but very often it does not do that! It drives me crazy!! I sometimes click the left side over and over and then it just skips pages ahead!! I know that if you click the lower right side it goes to the next page, but it shouldn't do that for the left side. Help me if I am doing something wrong!

It seems to smudge easy. My hands are always clean before I use it, but still shows fingerprint marks. I plan to eventually get a screen protector. I recommend getting the book cover. It is a good way to carry it with you.

Other than that I TRULY love it and highly recommend it."
G. Snapp,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from a 2nd generation Kindle. The Paperwhite is an improvement, with a couple of exceptions. It's smaller and lighter. The light is nice, and doesn't noticeably affect battery life; the battery life seems excellent. Access to Wikipedia and translations is great (although it doesn't translate Latin - bummer, because the book I'm reading has plenty of Latin quotations.

I have two main criticisms. 1) There isn't a lot of room around the margins to hold it. Also, the touch screen is so sensitive that if you barely brush it, it turns the page, and the page turning isn't noticeable. So you touch the screen without realizing it and when you pick it up again you don't recognize the page you're on, but don't know if you need to go forward or back. At least on the Kindle app for the IPad there's a graphic representation of the page being turned, so you're aware of it and which way it turned.

On my old Kindle I could type in a word to get a definition. You can't do that on the Paperwhite. It's only come up once so far, but I was bummed. You can get still a definition of a word on the page by touching and holding it, but you can't type in your own word."
Benjamin W. Pearre,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The screen is pretty good, although there is minor mottling towards the bottom. It responds very slowly compared to most modern screens, but that could just be an inescapable characteristic of the technology.

My main objection is that the power button is stupidly positioned: at the bottom of the device near the middle, almost right where my finger rests while holding the Kindle, and vulnerable to being pressed if you prop it up on a table. The result is that the Kindle keeps randomly putting itself into standby whenever I'm reading and accidentally bump the button.

""Battery lasts 6 weks"" is a blatant attempt to deceive: the battery lasts 20 hours, which of course Amazon mentions if you read carefully. But that's not the headline. Why the attempt at deception? To sell more units to people who don't read the fine print? Dear Amazon: you really have to try to trick people into buying your stuff? Your stuff is not terrible, but your disingenuousness is.

Also, it would be nice if the Kindle's purpose were to let you read your books, as advertised. Instead, a huge proportion of its effort is spent trying to sell you books you've never heard of, both in the screensaver (which you can pay to disable---but after buying the device, why should I pay even more just to be left in peace?) and in your ""Home"" screen, where a small portion of the screen is given over to your books, and a much larger portion is taken up with books Amazon wants you to buy. It is not primarily an e-reader, but rather an e-billboard. In this role, it is sick that Amazon makes you pay for the privilege of carrying around a device whose primary purpose is advertising to you.

Still a good technology, if only Amazon could figure out how to do good ergonomics, be honest, and learn to treat the people who buy the device as customers rather than as products."
The Rev Ari,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had the... third? gen Paperwhite for a number of years now, having started with the Kindle Keyboard (which I still have and use).

This is really a nice upgrade! I like the fact that it’s waterproof; I used to carry my Keyboard in a gallon ziplock so I could use it when relaxing in hot springs. Couldn’t do that with most Paperwhites, so the waterproof aspect of this gen (Oct 2018) is going to be awesome to test out.

The backlighting and case are a big improvement, and it really is lighter than my former Paperwhite. I like that it has more memory (same as the Keyboard), but what really got me is — Audible is back! That is fantastic. It’s one feature of the Keyboard that was sorely lacking in previous Paperwhites. I only have one set of Bluetooth headphones (Air Pods), but it was fairly easy to pair the new Kindle with them.

As to battery life — I can’t speak to it quite yet. My old Paperwhite wasn’t great. I read a ton on the Kindle, so I’ll have to see if I notice any difference between the two.

I got a third-party PU case for it with a space theme and I just love it.

I also got it for a super-sweet deal with trade-in of my old Paperwhite, so really, I am flying high with this device. Can’t beat a good Amazon deal!"
Cravin Morfish,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The image is nice and crisp and the lighting is even across the screen. All other functions work perfectly. You don't have to swipe to turn pages. You can just touch the screen on the right side and it'll turn to the next page. It's light and grippy, so you won't worry about dropping it. I haven't tested it in water and don't plan to. I have no complaints about this Kindle of any kind."
Benjamin,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hoping this would help me search thru books easier than on my phone, but you can't search thru chapters and sub chapters. One of my kindle books has 5 main chapters with each one having like 25-50 sub chapters in each. I'd love an update to kindle software to allow for searching subchapters to go to exact page, otherwise there's a lot of flipping and page. Unfortunately, I have a lot of these kinda books. It's kinda a pain to go thru each in my kindle app on my Mac ahead of time and have to book mark each section that I want to cover and study. Toch screen is kinda slow and clumsy, screen refresh as you scoll or flip pages is kinda clumsy. I thought it'd be a lot better for the $ and for the length of time it's been out. Menu and home page is not as intuitive as you'd think it should be. Like how are you gonna show tiles of the cover of books without the title below it, not every kindle book has it's title on the cover. and when I go to scroll it keeps selecting some random book off my home page recommendations. I guess it'll help while I'm reading a ton, but I'll still have to do a bunch of studying from the kindle app for Mac. I guess I was hoping for more."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I *** really **** dislike not being able to completely turn off this device, and not being able to schedule when software updates occur. I’d like to return it.

Update: I really dislike this thing for some books. Fortunately they keep giving huge discounts for books so I’m not out a lot of money - except for the price of the kindle. Amazon did not respond to my stated desire to return the kindle. Today I’m strongly regretting buying the kindle version of a useful book - at least it would be useful if it was a real book. I’m going to go ahead and order the paperback where the tactile experience will make it easy to quickly navigate and find the various figures that I need. Plus there won’t be problems with not being able to read tables of numbers.

It’s ok for some books, but is a pain in the neck for others.

Having said all of this negative stuff - I am mighty annoyed with it at the moment - I have to admit that for some books it seems ok. Easy to pick up where you left off, free samples are a good thing, as are reviews from other readers.

I still give it a two.

Update: bigger font size means I can read without glasses!!!! Awesome. Better than books.

Update: wtf search function in kindle. I thought “let’s see a list of William Gibson’s novels sorted by original publication date”. What could be simpler, right? Except that on idiot kindle you can’t get there from here. Fictiondb.combseems to think this is an easy thing, but idiot kindle - I guess not. Kindle search function and the geniuses who designed it - what possible reason could ther be for such an unhelpful search function? If you view a kindle store entry for a book and then click on the authors name you **still** can’t do reasonably simple sorting and further filtering. There must be some reason for having such an unhelpful search function - perhaps they are trying to discourage us from searching on the kindle, instead we should search somewhere outside of Amazon. Kind of sad. I hope I’m just overlooking something. Search: author=“William Gibson” type=novel sort=publication date. Should be easy. It’s not, not on Kindle. Really sucks."
Lantana Al,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice unit overall but minus 2 stars because it was driving me crazy while I was trying to highlight a particular passage. It kept going to other pages and doing strange stuff. Most of the time the touch-screen highlighting works well enough (even though there is definite room for improvement) but for some reason it decided to spaz out on at least one of my highlights and just refused to cooperate. It was extremely annoying... maybe they can get this fixed in a future software update.

On another note, the unit is lightweight but does seem/feel cheap. The backlighting does work very well and the screen is sharp and looks great in bright light and outdoors when it's sunny.

I bought this case and like it: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K1C1VMQ/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Overall 3 stars (for now)."
Yvonne Burchfield,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read a lot of books, at least 3 or more per week. I received my first Kindle (one of the original Kindles) on March 9, 2011. When it began to act strangely I knew it was time to replace it so I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite 10th Gen. which I received on July 16, 2019. So far I love it. Overall it is a bit smaller than my old one but the screen (reading area) is about the same. The built in light allows me to read in bed at night without disturbing my sleeping husband. Although I really liked the page turn buttons on my old Kindle, it was rather easy to adjust to the swipe method on the Paperwhite. I have found the touch screen to be very sensitive and you can easily change pages by accident if you are not careful. The only difficulty I have found with the touch screen is when trying to bring up the settings at the top of the screen. At times it is not as responsive and requires several attempts to get a response. So far I am satisfied with the battery life between charges as I can read several hours at a time most days and usually need to recharge every 2 to 3 days. My old Kindle finally gave out on July 29, 2019. It lasted 8 years 4 months and 20 days with heavy use. My hope is this new Kindle will be as good. Only time will tell."
P. Crowe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I prefer this to the Oasis (which I got because it is waterproof, and at that time Paperwhites were not). This newest version of the Paperwhite is waterproof, which I need because of pool and hot tub. I also prefer the single thickness of the device, rather than the two thicknesses in the Oasis. On the other hand, I like that the Oasis automatically rotates if you rotate the device. If I could have only one Kindle reader, it would be this one. Both Paperwhitess and Oasis sometimes make touch errors if your finger even gets close to the edge of the frame around the text or you (or your pet) accidentally brush the screen, but the Oasis is much worse about this. This device does turn itself off if you rest it at an angle because the on/off switch is a protruding button on the bottom. I prefer the software of the Paperwhite to the Oasis for organizing material. I am currently using 3 various generation e-readers and 2 Fires. The older models get stuffed into handbags and briefcases and are used for risky travel. It is possible to sync them all so that I can read part of a book on one device and then pick up where I left off on another when I get home or when (as may happen on the older devices) the battery dies. There is steady improvement. With the exception of some reference books and cookbooks, I am now mostly digital."
wr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ended up having to buy one when I ruined my last Paperwhite in the bathtub. Being waterproof is definitely handy ^_^ Part of me really wanted to get out of the Kindle ecosystem with my next e-reader, but none of the other brands and models available out there today have as good of a set of features at the price. Amazon also did me a solid by removing the ads (I had paid to have them removed from my previous Kindle that was water damaged within the first year, so that was very nice of them). I may stick with Kindle for a while after all. My only real complaint about it is that I have to keep my old chargers around, because even though it's a brand new device, they inexplicably didn't build it with USB C for some reason. I would pay extra for that... it's already outdated from day 1 just to save maximum a couple bucks on the manufacture?"
Lavona S.,4.0 out of 5 stars,I really love the super lightweightness of this it is a bit glitchy. Very sensitive to touch which can be frustrating at times you really have to be a light touch and not heavy handed. The weirdest and most annoying problem to me is I was reading one time and it completely froze up I held the button to refresh it like the manual told me nothing helped I even took it to my husband to help me he can almost fix anything still nothing after an hour of this I finally had to call for help I’m not 5 years old I shouldn’t have to call someone to tell me to hold it for approximately 45 seconds 1) that’s a lot of time to me and 2) write down an amount of time you want to hold the damn button. personally I don’t think it should have froze at all. I have an old dinosaur. a much well loved dinosaur of the kindle fire and never one lick of trouble it’s still going strong. the only reason my husband gave this one as a gift to me is I broke my dominant hand last year and he thought this being lighter would help and bigger memory so I guess I’m at a wait and see time with this I really want to love this as much as my old one so I’m hoping the freezer glitch thing is a one time issue.
D. Rhoads,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had the kindle app on my phone an iPad for several years and have been enjoying Kindle Unlimited for almost a year. I was reading my iPad in the sun and tired of squinting and moving it into shade, so after someone said the new kindle was waterproof and it was non glare I decided to take a look at it.
I took some time to read some of the reviews on all the devices and decided the kindle paper white was the one I would try out.
I knew Prime day was coming up soon (along with my birthday) and decided to wait for that day and use a gift card also.
I also ordered a blue waterproof cover to go with it.
it arrived earlier than expected and I anxiously took it out of the box and started it up.
first the Pros: really like the smaller size and the lightness of it compared to my iPad ( I have the smaller version). I can fit it into my medium size purse or my carry on when I travel.
the pages are crisp and i can read it in direct sun ( I live in AZ and have tried in the car and at the pool, no problems)
if you are traveling just make sure you have downloaded several books to read in case you are caught w/out wifi and didn't get the cellular coverage on the kindle.
Cons: having used the kindle app and the scroll function to read a book, imagine my surprise and disappointment in NOT being able to scroll to read! I hate that this is lacking on this devices and probably all the others.
When I touch or swipe to go the the next page there is a flash of the page turning to black and all the lettering turning to white?!? WTH!?!? I don't understand why this happens, never happened on the app! I contacted chat on amazon regarding this and it seems this does happen on all devices. I was ready to return it but thought I would give it another try.
We went away for the weekend and I read it by the pool and in the hotel room and in the car, trying to get used to the ""flash"" that happens when turning the pages. I am trying but I will keep it for another week to see if I can get used to it some more. Amazon, why can't you fix these two concerns???
Overall I do feel the weight and size of the device outweighs this but I will let you know for sure. This is why I am docking 1 star.
If these two items don't bother you then go for it."
Cole,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing. Light weight, doesn't take up space, fits in your hand perfectly. I also have Kindle Unlimited! I didn't get the one with built-in internet, but I just connect via hotspot to my phone whenever I need a new book. Which isn't that often cause I currently have plenty of stuff to read on it. I really wanted to declutter and not have to many books around the house so getting the kindle really helps me out. I like that I can have several books in my possession without have to break my back. If you are a reader, get a kindle. Find the right one for you. You don't need the most expensive one either. I got mine at Target during Black Friday and paid $85.00 for the Kindle Paperwhite. Sadly the case was not on sale and I paid $35.00 for it. But I still got it cause I wasn't about to risk a pricey electronic. Great buy! Get one for your kids! They are really worth it! If I had these when I was a kid I would have loved it! My poor parents always went crazy driving around town looking for my required reading books for classes. This would have been so much easier. Just click and buy. Also, love that Amazon emails me often with daily deals of books. I've bough a lot of them. Also, digital books are half the price sometimes. Which is great for staying in your budget. I recommend a kindle to any student: homeschooled, public, private, unschooled, Pre-K to Adults. Get one and grow your mind."
Symone,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my previous Kindle Paperwhite for this one because I really liked the idea of it being waterproof. I find it has a very sleek design thanks to the waterproof feature.
It has double storage which I don't really use since I just download books from the library.
Although I haven't used it, it is also able to play audiobooks through wireless speakers.
Now for the bad.
I have noticed that it doesn't go as bright as my previous Paperwhite. I have to put it on level 7 to 9 in the dark which is three levels higher than what I used on my old one.
Also they battery is very disappointing. My old one would last around 2 weeks on and off everyday before I considered charging it. At full charge this one will be down to 60% in less than 3 days.
Overall I miss the quality of my old Kindle. I loved how it felt like it would last forever. Made it feel closer to book status. But, I like getting to read by the bath without fear of my clumsy hands destroying it.
Warning note, I posted pictures above of the ""Water Protection"" because I think calling the device ""Waterproof"" is a little bit of a stretch after reading this. I'm not sure that they have this in the details section, but it came with the Kindle itself, so you might read it before deciding you want this specific Kindle."
BeMa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm comparing this to my kindle touch that I purchased in 2012. This is smaller, lighter, has it's own light. My older kindle had a light built in to the cover. I had an opportunity to trade my older kindle for 25% off this one and get a $5-15 credit. I didn't, because my old kindle is fine, I did take advantage of Prime day. Now you may wonder why get the new one? Well, I'm getting older and the light built into the case was harder for me to read at night. The Paperwhite's battery is fine. You can read in airplane mode like some suggested. I don't and it's fine, I've only recharged it once since buying (7/15) and it was only because it was down to 30%, and I would be waiting in a dr office. I read daily (I'm retired) or nightly. Take numerous breaks from gardening in the hammock and I read. I worried that I might leave it somewhere in the yard and it could get rained on...this one is water resistant. My older kindle was slightly larger so it didn't always fit in my bag, this is perfect fit. I love that I can adjust the light when I'm reading during the day or turn it up at night. It feels much lighter than my kindle touch. I also own a Kindle fire (okay a couple) but when I get down to just reading I loved my kindle touch (no interruptions) and the Paperwhite is the same...no emails, alerts etc. I'm extremely happy with the purchase."
Justin,2.0 out of 5 stars,Deceptive listing. The technical details on the paperwhite shows it has free 3G. However it is fairly well obscured elsewhere that a 3G option is available elsewhere for $199; although this NON-3G paperwhite for 84.99 clearly shows that it has free 3G in its technical details on the listing. Extremely deceptive. It’s even listed in the comparisons clearly showing the 84.99 version as having WiFi + free 3G
Shopper101,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th Kindle but first Paperwhite. It's advertised as having a long battery life but that's not the case. Instead of ""weeks"" from one charge, it's good for about 3-4 days at best. Also disappointed that it doesn't come with an adapter or charging cable. I replaced my last Kindle because the battery wouldn't hold a charge despite only being 14 months old. Something tells me this one won't even last that long. It seems that each new and improved Kindle is worse than the ones they are replacing. So disappointed."
Johnny L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A decent step up from my original Kindle Touch. The screen is lovely, the interface is pretty good, and the general reading experience is second to none.

The few issues I have are as follows: It seems to take a few seconds longer to wake up, compared to my other Kindle. I wish the settings for the light were quickly available, rather than having to go to the settings. The battery life does seem to last for less hours than my Kindle Touch did originally; it feels like I do less to impact the battery, which is a little bummer. And finally, I think it is just ridiculous that you get advertisements on a device that YOU OWN. You should be able to opt out (without having to pay). The biggest thing that is making the device feel like your own, is just seeing Amazon's advertisements about crap you don't care about, and banner ads on the homescreen.

It is such a necessity for me. It feels wonderful in the hand, wonderful to read on, and everything. It feels like the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in real life. But, the advertisements just make it feel like a B, instead of an A+. It could be extraordinary, but instead it feels like a bit cheaper of an experience."
nashvilleite,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Five stars for the product:
Bought this for my husband as a Valentine's Day/Birthday gift after he spend 1 month trying to convince himself it was worth the money. He LOOOOVVVESSS it and now gets to bed earlier because he can read in bed without the light on = better sleep for me. My husband reads a million books each year, and when we go on trips, there is basically an extra suitcase dedicated to books. Literally, even to Hawaii. Notevenkidding. Now, we can travel lighter, save $ checking luggage, he gets more sleep, I get better sleep, he reads just as much, and EVERYONE's life is better. Who knew a kindle improves family health? His other likes are the amazon discount with the ""Great on Kindle"" books, he's been able to buy 3x as many books. He also tells me he doesn't miss holding a book like he thought he would. He bought a cover as well, and just last night said, it is surprisingly satisfying to be able to shut my kindle off by closing the cover, makes it feel more like a real book. I have an old kindle (maybe 6 yrs old?), and am jealous of the light feature but otherwise I feel like they are pretty similar in size and weight. Overall, the 5 star rating is for this product.

One star for the delivery:
The delivery however was not so great and ruined the surprise I had planned. The kindle came in it's box, that was in a plastic bag and shipped in a manilla envelope, that I think was lined with bubble wrap. Unfortunately, the day it was delivered, there were flooding rains here. My husband got home from work first, and the package was falling apart, soaking wet, and basically opened. As a result my husband, who never opens my packages and not knowing what it was, finished opening the remaining 50% of the envelope to make sure that the contents were safe and found the kindle. Since he'd been talking about it so much, he got worried that our Alexa speaker might have ordered it by mistake somehow, and starting panicked texts to me. Eventually I had to admit it was a present for him, and cold no longer proceed with my plan to stuff other smaller presents and a card in the envelope then act ""surprised"" that he got a secret valentine gift from someone. I was so upset. I'm sure Amazon can't put packages in the mailbox legally, even if they fit. But I have a storm door. It would have been pretty easy to lay the package against my front door and close the storm door. And all surprises and envelopes would have remained intact."
Dache,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:

Great battery life.

Easy to read text on the screen in any lighting condition.

Ebooks are cheaper than paperbacks.

Serves its purpose.

Cons:

Terrible form factor, too thin and too wide to hold comfortably for long periods, why not make it taller and thinner like a cell phone or... you know, a book.

Controls are not intuitive, had to google how to do certain things multiple times. Got through my first book thinking it was swipe left to advance a page/swipe right to go back (its not, but doing that kinda works). Had no idea how to get back to main menu from within a book. Multiple times it advanced more than one page and had trouble getting back to where is was.

Ads... personalized ads for books on the screen whenever it is ""off."" If you like to read romance but dont want to broadcast it to the person sitting on the plane next to you, you better keep it face down (or buy a case with cover) when not reading.

Highlighting text, why on earth would I want to highlight text in a fiction book? When you accidentally touch the screen wrong it often highlights some text. Then you spend the next few minutes trying to unhighlight the text."
Dan E. Mayer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was surprised at the smaller size than my old Kindle that had a fixed keyboard. But most of the difference is from moving to a touchscreen keyboard. And the small size makes it easy to hold. Screen resolution is excellent and the e-ink at 300 dpi makes it much easier on the eyes than my Kindle Fire. I got the model without ads and I love that it just starts up and goes right to my book. I'm surprised that the battery life isn't better. It goes down to around 50% in a week. I've read complaints about placement of the power button, but that hasn't been a problem for me at all.

I like having the dictionary at the press of a word on the screen. That's a big improvement the touchscreen offers over my old Kindle. The WordWise feature looks like a good idea, but needs more granularity in the settings. For me, it provides help on way more words than I need help on, regardless of setting. And it consumes a lot of screen real estate in doing so. So there's room for improvement.

I would suggest moving to USB-C connector so you don't have to look at which way to plug it in everytime."
rockincook,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd Kindle Paperwhite and I love all the improvements. Waterproof! Now I’ll feel less nervous reading by the pool. Battery life is better than before for me. I read a couple hours every night, airplane mode off, blue tooth off, reading for 4 days and the battery is still at 80%! Yay! For those having trouble with the battery, shut off Bluetooth. The audible part of this is not a feature I need. If I want to listen to an audio book (which I don’t) I would have used my Kindle Fire or now my IPad. When you first set up and download all the books from the cloud and the updates you’ll need to recharge but after that the battery should last a couple weeks.
My favorite update to this new version is NO BEVEL! I love the flat screen, no more getting dog hair and Kleenex crumbs under the edges.
Anyway, I’m very happy with the latest Paperwhite and it only cost me 13 bucks after I Traded in 2 old Paperwhites, kindle fires and a 3rd gen. IPad. Amazon makes the whole trade in thing so easy and they give you the money to spend before you even ship it!
Now I even have an additional $35 gift card!"
J. Adams,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not crazy about this one (Paperwhite, waterproof, purchased 2019). It's much slower to wake up than the two year old Paperwhite I had to replace because it would no longer hold a charge. Additionally, I don't like that the screen is completely flat. With the raised bezel you at least had a small place to hold it, and it was somehow easier to pick up that way as well. The page turns are more sluggish than before and I often have to tap repeatedly. It really does feel like a step back. The waterproofing is nice, but it's not a game changer for me. I don't read in the bath or the pool, and never had a problem taking my old Kindle to the beach.

Two more complaints: why do we still not have a simple/faster way of organizing books? Collections are clunky and I want to be able to organize quickly either from the device or from my laptop.

Also, these things don't last. This has to be my 5th or 6th Kindle. I think this is my 3rd Paperwhite. It's getting to be ridiculous. I looked at the more expensive Oasis, and I might have bought one to see if it lasted longer but they've made it with an aluminum chassis and seriously, no thank you. I'd be dropping it all the time, and cases add a significant amount of weight. I love the rubberized grip on the Paperwhite.

All of that said, I'm still here. Gone are the days of lugging a huge bag of books on vacation, and trying to decide which books to keep and which ones have to be donated. I love the convenience, and I love that I don't even need a lamp on my nightstand anymore. I just wish the format was a little better and more reliable."
N. C. Schmidt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to turn in my Kindle with the keyboard and my Kindle white (can't really remember the model but it's like 6 years old...maybe older). My old cover did not fit it as it's skinnier than my previous model. So with this, I added a magnet cover. It actually wakes up when I open the cover!

And it's water resistant...which is what catapulted me to purchasing this as I love to read in the bath and am always nervous when water splashes from the faucet or when I set it aside and wash my hair (and yes, water does splash over the tub when I wash my hair) so now I have no anxiety that the electronics will go haywire."
Jennifer P.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like my Paperwhite, I have an older generation one that I loved too. My biggest complaint with these is you can’t fix minor issues. My old paperwhite still works fine, it just doesn’t hold a charge for an overly long time. It annoys me that I can only send it in for a small credit towards a new one. I kept it for now, I’ll use it until the battery life shortens further. I also bought this new one. The size was literally like 1/16th of an inch smaller so of course my nice leather case from the old one didn’t fit. Ugh. Had to buy a new one for the new one. The screen feels different and it’s a little slower to turn on. Also when you swipe the screen, it takes longer to “wake up”. The waterproof aspect is nice because we vacation at the beach and I read there too. Overall I like it but I really despise the disposable treatment of these by Amazon. Unfortunately these are easier for me to carry so I can read more this way. If I didn’t already have so many Kindle books that I paid for, I would switch to the Nook reader. Worth the money if you read a lot though and you don’t mind buying new cases when you upgrade."
ScubaDude,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had my eye on Kindles for years but never considered buying one since I have the Kindle app on my iPad, etc. Problem was, I never read books on my iPad because it’s relatively heavy when held in a reading position for a period of time, and the display is difficult in bright light. And in low light (eg, in bed), the display is too bright or too dim.... It’s just not a good reading device for me. So when Prime Days offered a deal, I picked up this Kindle. And I love it. The paperwhite display is great and the battery life is, too, except as noted by others, it fades rapidly if WiFi is left on. I leave it in Airplane mode except when I need to downoad or refresh content. The only issue is the display is rather sluggish but page turns are fine; scrolling is not great. Otherwise, the device is perfect.
Update 20190818: I downgraded 2 stars because of the sluggish display. I started a Kindle Unlimited subscription and browsing for titles is so SLOW. Browsing my library is SLOW. You need to learn to go slowly as it will cache your strokes, so if you impatiently swipe again, then it when it ends up on the next page, it will frustratingly scroll to the next page. Infuriating. But, as noted in my first review, actually reading books is great. The device is light, cool (temp-wise) and very portable. Just wish they could improve response time, though that may require a more powerful chip and cost more."
KymmLisa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a Kindle 10 and was using that to read my books, but the battery life was horrible. I couldn't read all day without having to charge it, so I bought this Paperwhite. Upon opening the package I was taken aback by the size of it I had no idea it was so small. I wasn't sure about it until I started playing around with it. I love that it's waterproof, not that I plan on reading in a pool or anything, but you never know what might happen. I also love the extended battery life. I'm still getting used to the size of it, but now realize I can always have my book with me. It's small enough to throw in any purse I have, not only the big ones. In conclusion for reading the Paperwhite seems to be the ticket and if you want a Kindle to do other things, ie. Netflix, Facebook, etc. I'd say get the Kindle 10."
Charles Martell,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had this a few weeks right now. Generally it is a good device and there are things that are very nice. The built in light for instance. I like the quality of the text and the flexibility available for adjustment. I like the size and I bought the Amazon leather cover and I like that also.
The negatives are that somehow I expected this would connect to the Kindle Store without a WiFi but have discovered that this device seems not to do that. If that is important to you and it is for me then look to a different device. My biggest complaint is that I have had to essentially give up highlighting. The touch screen makes this activity virtually impossible to do in a time effective manner. If you want to highlight with any precision do not expect this device to accommodate you or be prepared to go back and forth over and over and if the desired text to be highlighted continues to a subsequent page pretty much forget it. Highlighting also was important to me and one of the reasons I used a Kindle My very old keyboard machine was a dream and worked intuitively for the most part. Coming from the old device to this one was not intuitive and required that I actually read the manual before being able to do very much. So be ready to spend some time learning this device thru study. All in all though Kindles show how an electronic device can be quite good when they stick to a single minded purpose."
Terri B.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only been using this Paperwhite since Christmas Day, I love the size, weight and clarity, However the placement of the on/off switch has irritated me many times already. If you prop it on a table, the button is sensitive enough that it turns it off! You get a popup, but even if you hit the right choice, it will still reboot. So, reading hands free at a table is inconvenient. My primary reason for purchase is also. I have a stand in my bath tub for reading, and the Paperwhite reboots constantly. I have had to fashion a cushion so that it is elevated on the button side, and sits at a slight tilt. WHY wasn't the switch placed on the top???? I have a Glowlight from B&N that's old, so the waterproof feature drew me to the Paperwhite. But the button on the bottom makes it more difficult to use by far."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had my first Kindle for 8 years and loved it, it was basic no built in light, but never gave me any problems. In the last 2 months it kept saying there was a technical error and go weird and lose the story, so I knew it was time to buy a new one, I checked them all over and finally decided on the paper white. So far I like the built in light, the touch screen is a little too “touchy”, so I need to get used to that, battery life is not as good as my old one, so that’s disappointing, not all of my books that I haven’t read yet made it to the new kindle, so I asked for help and still had to go to my Amazon account and manually get those books on the new kindle. All in all I like it , but I do miss my old one
UPDATE: 8-11-2019. well sadly the new kindle paper white just had too many problems, after plugging it in and making sure it was 100% charged, I tried to turn it on and it just showed a picture of a battery with an explanation mark!! so had to plug in again. after turning it off for the night, when I try to turn it on the next day, it will not turn on, I have to press the on button and hold it until it blinks 3 times, then it will eventually open. It then loses my book that I was reading and I have to find it and start all over again! very frustrating. I contacted Amazon, and they are sending me a new one, keeping my fingers crossed that this one will be perfect."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very excited to use this device.
My first Kindle!
I really love Amazon, and was excited to give this a try.
But didn't know what to expect since it was my first e-reader kindle.
Package is very simple and attractive, I really like it, however, when i turned-ON the kindle the first thing I noticed was a (dead screen) tiny spot almost in the center of screen. Not big deal but noticeable.

Since I read at night, in the dark, I'm used to the dark background screen. After putting kids to sleep I spend a good 10 minutes trying to find the dark theme, (inverted mode they called it)
When I finally got it on, the thing that shocked me the most was a white flash I'll get every time i flip a page (it last about 1 full second) I'm guessing it has to do with the kindle processor. Now not only I got the noticeable spot around the center of screen but a white flash every time i change the page. (SAD)

After paying full price for this device, and considering those 2 main defects, and its slow responsiveness, and battery life is not like they promote.

I see lots of 5 stars reviews, seems like I was the one to get the broken one for that reason I cannot recommend this kindle device. In over 10 years using amazon I have never made a return, don't even know how that works, and that is $129.99 lost for me."
Sandypo,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't realize that there was so little crossover between the Paperwhite and Kindle Fire. I should have done my homework better, I thought I was ""stepping up"" but instead the Paperwhite had fewer features and a much smaller screen. In 10 seconds I had finished reading each page and had to swipe again which was a huge pain, not too mention that I couldn't download books from BookFunnel or look up definitions quickly or any number of features that I had on my Kindle Fire. I am returning the Paperwhite immediately."
Sarah E Johnson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have visual issues. There are too many new bits to understand to get to a menu that I can see. So far, I've manage to find 3 books I didn't want to read, and none of the books (that were in folders so I could find them in the old Kindle) that I want to enjoy. However, after writing this review, Customer Service was quick to call me and then spent a long visit on the phone, working through the issues and helping me find the 'missing' books so I could recreate the folders and not continue to be frustrated. Kudos, Marci, who was very patient."
SergeiS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this Kindle on Amazon Prime Day (about six months ago) to replace my 10 yr old Sony eReader, which had become pretty buggy. I've been using it heavily since then. Initially I was disappointed by how little the technology has changed. The two devices looked very similar side by side. However, the built-in light is awesome, and I was impressed by the seamless interface with Amazon and Overdrive. New books are loaded instantly when connected to Wifi. The navigation on the device is pretty intuitive as well. I have been reading more than ever because of how easy it is to access material.

A single battery charge can last me several books worth of reading if I don't use the light. With the light on, the battery is drained understandably faster (especially at full power), though not to the point of inconvenience for me so far.

My only real complaint about this device is that sometimes the touch screen doesn't respond and I have to tap it several times to advanced the page. This was an issue from the get-go and doesn't seem to be getting worse, so I can live with it."
Josh & Michelle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using a Kindle fire to read and listen to books at the same time when I work out. It is easy to do because there’s a simple play button at the bottom of the screen, I can change the speed of the playback, and the controls or just easily accessible. The only downside is that I hated the glare of the screen on the Kindle fire. It is easy to do because there’s a simple play button at the bottom of the screen, I can change the speed of the playback, and the controls are just easily accessible. The only downside is that I hated the glare of the screen on the Kindle fire. I purchased this Kindle Paperwhite and the screen is perfect, easy to read, no lighting problems and no glare.

Because the Kindle paperwhite has the option for Bluetooth headphones I thought it would have the same playback capability as the Kindle fire. But I was really mistaken. There is an option to hear what you’re listening to however it is not nearly as easy to access the playback buttons, speed of playback, or having the option to highlight the text while listening.

If there were an option to have the same screen that I have with the Kindle paperwhite and the audio capabilities of the Kindle fire, that e-reader would be perfect."
Katey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this for myself because I wanted to give e-ink reading a try. I've always read on my phone using applications before, my computer, or, years and years ago the Nook Color tablet so I could read comics. I contemplated getting a Nook e-ink reader since I've bought so many of my ebooks from them in the past, but I was started to gather quite an Amazon collection over the last year too so I figured why not go with the one with better ratings/reviews instead of sticking with my brand loyalty. I'm sure I would have liked the Nook too, but I must say I love my Kindle and do not regret my purchase in the least. I take it with me to work every day to read while on lunch, and I take it into the bath with me and love the fact that I don't have to worry since it is water resistant.

I haven't had to charge my device once yet, and I'm still at 73% so the ""weeks"" long charge for me is true. Then again I don't read for hours a day. I don't have enough hours in my day sadly to devote to just reading or I would. Yay life. But hey, that just means the battery will last that much longer for me heh."
DC,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My mom got this is a gift for me, and at first, it seemed okay, a little odd to navigate around and less features than I would have liked. But it's light weight and waterproof and a better alternative to carrying books around all the time like I normally do.
The Problem: it's a little glitchy, when it turns on accidentally in my bag, it has a hard time getting back to the home screen. It also closes out of the book I'm reading spontaneously.

Because it came 50% charged (and it does last A WHILE) I didn't even think to charge it until a few weeks after getting it. That's when I noticed that the included cord which came in the box with the Kindle, does not fit the device and I have no way to charge it.

I really wanted to like this, but honestly I'd rather bring a book or two around with me."
Andrew M. Klein,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it. Am inseparable from it. Losing it (and that has happened) causes serious withdrawal symptoms and requires an immediate replacement. In my case I left it on the trunk of my car while doing other things and meaning to leave after completing them. I left without putting it in the car! Panic set in at once. Ordered the replacement. (Kept going back over my car route to find the one that had to have fallen off somewhere. My third try revealed my lost Kindle in its grey protective, soft, cushioned cover in the middle of a four lane two-way highway! Parked, looked both ways, lept tp retrieve it, got back to car in one piece, unzipped the cover, and found it somehow had escaped being run over -- or had somehow survived even that. The lost Kindle, now found, was in perfect working shape and undamaged. It sits in my library now waiting for my next mistake! )

Four points. First, it is all too easy on this version to hit the ""off"" button at the bottom accidentally. I don't know how to redesign it to prevent this, but it would be a good idea if doable. Second, the ""flush-front"" design seems slicker, but so what? It's actually a bit harder to hold than the older version. Third, the surrounding black border is quite wide at top and bottom, presumably to permit the user to get a better grip on it under all circumstances. But a slightly bigger reading page ought also to be possible with these rim widths. Last, a longer lasting battery, desired by the entire world, would be great, but not if one has to give up the flatness and light weight of this version.

I see your newer version promises this, but not in specific, measurable terms. C'mon, Amazon. Give it to us straight! It gets a five from me in spite of all of this. If possible I'd give it a six.

I see there's a new other Kindle version now (Oasis) that gives larger reading page without losing the essential smallness of the device. Good! But the Oasists rim looks too narrow except on the right-hand side to hold comfortably with the left hand or at the top or bottom. For that reason, I am unlikely to get one, but I'll check the reviews on this issue. Bigger screen by an inch is not worth loss of ease of use and easy finger/hand placement in all positions, all places, and all circumstances.

Note to Amazon: Your technology is a wonder, but are you really doing your very best with ergonomics experts in your design department? You do have them I hope. Do you?"
Crystal,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received my twilight blue 10th generation paperwhite kindle today and I do really like it. It's super lightweight and was easy to set up. For the most part it is anti glare, but in certain spots and lighting, it does catch a glare on the screen... mostly not though, hard to explain, only harsh lighting causes a glare!! Florescent lights, for example, in my office at work, if I am directly under one, it was cause a glare on the screen. I'm unsure if it's my eyesight or if this is a common issue, but some parts of the screen almost seem blurry to me? This is my very first e-reader in YEARS so this very well could be my eyes adjusting to an e-reader? I just got mine today so I can't say anything about battery life or storage yet... I will update my review in time. I am enjoying it for my first e-reader! I was using my tablet before, which was heavy and had BAD glare, so this is so much better for reading, I love it!!!! Easy to get ebooks from my library like I used to with the kindle app. So convenient and light, easy to take every where and read in any lighting!

Overall, I do love it so far, with it being my first kindle!

Update: battery life is amazing! Charges really fast then can go for days without needing a charge. I love it, I take it everywhere and it's so convenient to be able to do so! Glare is almost non existent. Storage is amazing, I still haven't run out of room! Very impressed and would buy again!"
R. Hiltner,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the functionality and convenience, but... do NOT lose track of your Kindle. Amazon will be ZERO help, apparently by design. Here's what happened:

I entered in my contact info to the unit when I got it so that I could be contacted by someone if I ever lost it. No guarantee, but it's something I would do if I found one. Well, I lost it. I called Amazon and their only option was let it ride (allowing for purchases from the unit) or deregister it, wiping and locking the unit. What if I just want to keep people from purchasing on it. I don't really CARE if someone uses it to read my books and am willing to risk that for the possibility of a Good Samaritan returning it to me. Nope, not an option.

If I deregister it and someone finds it, can they contact you to get it back to me, maybe by mailing it to you at my expense or connecting us with our mutual permission? Nope. They have NO interest, apparently, in your getting your kindle back, and this is probably because it means more sales for them.

This is in the category of semi-benign corporate malfeasance, but it's still obnoxious when it would be so easy for Amazon to be a hero in this situation. They choose to be the goat, and I do NOT mean that capitalized.

That said, I did reluctantly purchase a replacement because I prefer the format, but the sour taste and bad feelings will long remain."
Farrel Sparks,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Paperwhite lives up to the hype. It's easy to read. Easy to handle. Easy to use.
The battery life is better than my Kindle e-reader. And considering the fact it doesn't have a backlight, that's pretty good.
It holds more books than I'll ever own.
I bought the blue model and after I put it in the case I bought (an Amazon product) no color shows. So, if getting a specific color is important to you, keep that in mind.
If you're still using a Kindle or an earlier generation of the Paperwhite the improvements are worthwhile. Knowing it's waterproof does give me peace of mind, even though it hasn't been out to the test, yet."
Remi,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle and I gotta say it’s not bad. The text quality is crisp and refined. I love how light it is. It’s also very portable because of its small size. I’ve read on it for hours and have not had a problem with my eyes hurting because of the screen. Although I do put my screen on night mode, meaning black screen white text, so I don’t know if it’s the same having the opposite. People say they have a problem with the glaring on the screen and I see what they mean. I have some glare on my screen too but it’s nowhere near comparable as having glare on your smartphone. The glare is subtle to the point where it doesn’t bother me or the text on the screen. I do have a problem with this Kindle claiming that it’s “glare free” that’s false advertisement. It should state “reduced glare” or something along those terms. Another thing I’d like to add is that the power button positioned on the bottom of the Kindle is a nuisance! I’ve had several times, while reading, where the power button had been pushed accidentally with the brush of my finders thus turning the device off. This ruins my reading experience and it’s very annoying to the point where I’m contemplating if I should return this Kindle or not. Why couldn’t they have put the power button on top of the kindle where no one will dare touch. This does not make any sense to me. I don’t know how it was like for the other Kindle models but having the button right where I put my finders to hold the Kindle is upsetting. Such poor quality design. Because of this reason alone I am rating this product 3 stars.

Note: Case sold separately."
ELBERT BERNSTEIN,4.0 out of 5 stars,"In January 2019 I bought from Amazon the All-new Kindle Paper White – Now Waterproof with more than 2x the Storage – Includes Special Offers 32 GB Digital Memory.
It is of a good quality, the paper white lighting is even on all the margins, a You Tube review said the bottom margin lighting was not even, but I do not see that, Kindle most likely fixed the problem.
The touch screen at first is kind of touchy, but it seems to loosen up
after a little use.
When you turn the Kindle off, place it in Airplane Mode and turn the screen off, this stops the battery from being depleted. Airplane Mode turns the power off to the Router and Blue Tooth. It looks like the power for the Router and Blue Tooth may stay on when the Kindle is off and not in Airplane Mode.
I charge the Kindle with a Sony Charger 5 Volts 1 Amp and the inline DROK Digital USB Multimeter to watch the charging on the Kindle Paper White, as the Kindle charged up, you could see the current Amps decrease from .97 Amp to 0.02 Amps and the voltage increase slightly from 5.0 V to 5.10 V. When fully charged, the Kindle light changes from yellow to green.
The Kindle will play audio to the blue tooth speaker when being charged,
there is still enough power left to increase the battery power."
Patrick J. Kelly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the Kindle Paperwhite, wifi only, with offers. I have had it for a couple of weeks. The 300 dpi screen resolution is nearly the same as the printed page, but the Paperwhite seems easier to read than many paperbacks, especially old paperbacks with yellowed pages. As my eyes age I can imagine using the large size font.
Someone did their human engineering well on the screen. The 6 inch diagonal screen is sufficient. It covers the focus area of my eyes, so i don't have to move the Kindle or my head to read from left to right. There is no glare. Why can't all screens be made this way?
The book that I am currently reading has a ""page number"" formatted like this Loc### . It is not counting pages but pieces of a page. I wish the pagination would be the same as a paper book, so I could easily share a reference with someone else who may be reading a paper copy. The Loc### number is also oddly placed lower left.
I bought a case, merely for extra protection. The device is so light, that I don't expect to use the case's kickstand feature.
I have used it for a few hours at a time and seen very little battery drain. The touch screen seems to be better adjusted than my phone's. I have wide fingers, but I rarely make mistakes. I haven't used the lights, but plan to next time I am on a long flight. I like the ""waterproof"" feature, not for use at the beach, but because I think it will make the product last longer."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately there are some things not living up to my Kindle paperwhite standard. Old kindle: Paperwhite generation 4

1. The navigation with a poor touchscreen makes my insides boil waiting and waiting... Just wishing I had my hard buttons still. Give both options if you won't give a quality touchscreen.

2. Backlight. I will attach a photo. Enough said. It happens both inverted and not.

3. Battery is solidly shorter in life then my previous Kindle. Especially if the backlight it on at all. Part of my love of my Kindle is not having to worry about charging it often. Unfortunately I will have to charge it every night now with how I use my Kindle.

4. I felt pressured into buying it right away while I was still deciding my the customer service rep helping me. Constantly asking me to verify if I had made the purchase yet. Though I was unsure it would meet my needs.

5. The accessability voice back is horrible. Touchscreen lags alot to even click a word, as well it just keeps freezing and getting stuck. I had to turn it off to even be able to use the Kindle at all.

With all THAT said... and a highly critical review I will 'likely', but not sure yet (battery life will be my final decision probably) will end up keeping it as I like the case/set up and am already getting used to it's flaws, since every device has it's flaws.

I use Paperwhite for my wrists and mobility issues so overall better for me flaws and all. Time shall tell."
Austin Birrell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To start, I am a huge Apple consumer. I love all of my Apple products. I also love reading. My iPad was my daily driver. However, the screen began to make my eyes feel tired (I am only 24) and I missed reading ink on paper. I have not wanted to get a Kindle for a long time and thought they were clunky and a waste of money. Hold the phone, because I was dead wrong (gasp).

I have had my Kindle for about a month know and I absolutely love it. It is the simplest thing on the planet. I was worried that it was going to be too small (as if I thought normal books were as big as my iPad). It feels like it is the perfect size. But what about those huge belles (it's 2019 for crying out loud)?! They're perfect. It allows your hands to grasp the thing. If there were not bezels it would not be comfortable to hold and you would be turning the page incessantly. What about that white Kindle logo? Yeah that's ugly and intrusive, but something I can deal with.

I mostly read with the Libby app. It allows me to rent books using my library card and read them with the Kindle app. It works beautifully with this device. I love that the screen is ink. My eyes do not feel as strained as when I read on my iPad LCD display. I have not noticed bad reflection in sunlight. With any screen if the position is just right you will be a zap of light in your eyes. Just tilt and adjust. It looks the best tin sunlight and very clear. It is a bit heavy as well, but I have not had a problem with it. Like I said, I have had it for a month and only had to charge twice with reading about 1 or 2 hours a day. The LED night is convenient when I read at night and it not too bright to be hard on the eyes.

If you like reading then I defiantly recommend this product. I do not miss reading on my iPad one bit. Plus I am not getting a lot of distracting notifications as I read now. Reads like a book but does not have the arm fatigue or lighting issues when reading in bed (one page is always harder to see and you have to hold then book up m ore to see which stains your arm). With the Kindle I can comfortably lay on my side and read away without having to change position or move anything but the occasional thumb to turn the page. I highly recommend this product if you want the easy of reading on a device with the look of a good 'ol book."
Toni Lang,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by saying this was a gift for my 15 yr old niece who is taking college classes. She loves to read and I wanted to get her the “best kindle” on the market right now, boy was I wrong, brand new outta of the box the screen glitches and freezes and just all in all the cheap tablets from Walmart work better. They try to sell you on this being the new and improved please don’t make the same mistake, it was literally junk. Amazon do better!"
Michael H. Zeldis,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Good
------------
1. Light weight - Can hold for an extended period of time without any problem
2. Long lasting battery especially if you turn off Bluetooth
3. Readable inside or outside, in the dark or light
4. Access to thousands of books through Goodreads
5. Can access books in your library without having access to WiFi

The Bad
-----------
1. Very slow even when waking up. Turning pages is okay but everything else is slow.
2. Navigation is mediocre especially when you have downloaded a lot of books
3. Can open only one book at a time
4. Research of a subject limited to Wikipedia

The Ugly
-----------
1. Trying to read a Wikipedia article is almost impossible - Needs to add the Wikipedia app so when you want to read the full article on a subject it opens the Wikipedia app which is far more readable than the way Paperwhite now works.
2. Tweeting a highlighted section of a page does not seem to work. No problem tweeting it using the Kindle app on Fire Tablet.
3. Access to Kindle books in the Amazon store is terrible on all levels.

Suggested Improvements
-------------------------------
1. Faster processor
2. Allow for multiple books to be open at one time
3. Improve navigation making it easier to find books in your library.
4. Add Wikipedia app for easier reading of a Wikipedia article
5. Add dictionary choices and allow for multiple dictionaries at one time. For example I am currently reading
History of England and a lot of words are not in dictionary. Adding an British dictionary may help solve this problem.
6. Need to improve access to Kindle store to make it more appealing and usable.

Summary
------------
Excellent for basic reading under all conditions in all places for extended periods of time. Beyond that it needs a lot of work to make it a killer product."
Eric Gee,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from my old kindle but this thing is garbage. When trying to connect to wifi on the road such as at a hotel, etc where a login or ""additional steps"" are required, this piece of garbage states that it must connect ""via an experimental browser""..REALLY? Aren't there MILLIONS of kindles out there that would supposedly connect to hotel and other networks that require additional steps?!?!?! Amazon, in all it's wisdom can't figure out how to connect to networks that require authentication with something more than and ""experimental"" browser?! I'm stuck at a hotel and this piece of garbage can't connect to the wifi despite my phone, laptop and other devices being able to do so? I'm just floored that AMAZON can't produce a device that is unable to connect to networks that require authentication!!! This is when I'm normally using the device... when I'm traveling. I am going to RETURN THIS and keep my old device!

Really amazon?!?!?!"
Johnny Paint,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The features and functionality are very nice. The battery performance is poor. It is so poor that I thought it was defective. Before attempting to return it, I searched through the reviews and found that my disappointment was experienced by many people. It seems that the poor battery performance is a characteristic of the Paperwhite. I couldn't find anyone who was able to achieve the run-time advertised by Amazon. I think Amazon is falsely advertising on the battery life and it appears that a lot of other people agree. Shame on Amazon.

My other dissappointment is that the audible functionality of the Paperwhite will not work with AirPods. It is my understanding that it will not work with any other listening device that has a built-in microphone.

My final disappointment is the difficulty I have with attempting to get it to connect to Blue Tooth. It will connect, however it's not easy and may take many attempts to get it to connect.

If it weren't for these three huge disappointments, I would really enjoy the Paperwhite experience."
DKTempelton,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The advertisement on Amazon's site says that ""the battery lasts weeks, not hours."" I realized when I purchased it that this was a pretty subjective statement, because how long a battery lasts depends on how much reading you do, whether you are connected to the internet and if you have the light on. I am retired. I spend, on average, about 4 hours a day reading, most of it on my Kindle. So far, the battery has lasted, at the longest, 5 days. Granted, this is much better that the battery life of my old Kindle. However, it would be much more helpful if Amazon's ad for Kindle gave an estimation of how many HOURS of reading one would get from the battery, rather than a vague ""lasts weeks."""
CBear4242,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered the Kindle Paperwhite (it is anything BUT ""paperwhite"", by the way...). I found product slow, kludgy, with awful font rendering. Also, didn't realize that it was not Bluetooth-enabled on purchase - but it has ALL the GUI elements of setting up Bluetooth! WHY on EARTH would you leave those elements in the GUI if the device was NOT Bluetooth-enabled? Just simply a dumb move. The screen did not track well - and using it (such a small, annoying, boring screen) - was eventually more trouble than it was worth.

I called Amazon and got permission to return it within a few days of its delivery. Unfortunately, I took a taxi, left it behind accidentally - and now cannot return it. But, honestly - I was so tired and annoyed with the Kindle, that on discovering at the hotel that I no longer had it - it was WORTH it just not to have to be annoyed by its sluggish, erratic performance and behavior. I just said to myself - ""Fine, let someone else have it and be annoyed with it!"" I didn't both to even call the taxi service to return it. It was so bad, I was glad to just be rid of it.

I know people say they LOVE their Kindles - I just can't figure out why."
Jill,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This new kindle paperwhite is a baby step up from the previous model. It's crazy that they haven't shrunk the size of the bezels. It's really an eyesore and looks like outdated technology. The worst part is the white ""kindle"" trademark on the front. It is so eye catching on the black background. I know that may seem like a small annoyance, but it bothers me so much that I resort to only reading this kindle in landscape mode so my hands cover up that trademark and the bezels don't seem as large.

Also, I accidentally dropped my kindle about 3ft. It was in a padded sleeve when it fell, but the screen still cracked in various places. So even with protection, the device is pretty brittle.

I also have the basic Kindle 2019 and I would recommend it over this PW."
MusicFan88,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I will keep this short. The kindle paperwhite does what it claims to do. Reading in bed at night has become MUCH easier now that I have a built in light. My wife claims it doesn't keep her up like my LED book like used to. The battery life has also been excellent.
That being said, there are of course some negatives. The screen is quite small and they did not leave much room around the edge for holding. This results in me accidentally turning pages or clicking things by mistake, when I'm just trying to hold the reader in bed. I had to spend a good chunk of extra money to get a larger case so there is something to hold onto, other than the Kindle.
Next, the build in ads on Amazon devices are very annoying. They aren't as bad on the Kindle as they are on the Fire tablet, but they still feel intrusive. Either price the device a little higher and remove the ads, or don't charge $20 after buying the device to be able to remove them. I feel as though if people are buying your devices, they don't need constant ads reminding them to go online and spend more on your site. We will do that on our own. Don't get me started on the fire tablet, which will actually display ads constantly until your battery dies, requiring you to keep it plugged in at all times or power it down after each use entirely.

Overall, this is a great ""BASIC"" reader device. It has no bells or whistles, but it gets the job done if you are wanting to be read, especially if you read in bed at night and need a light."
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It does not want to take a charge. I've plugged it in, and plugged it in, using cords and chargers that I know work on other devices. Restarting helps sometimes; today I had to reset the device to factory settings and go through all the WiFi and Amazon registration steps again, just so the cursed thing will take a charge.

It is also finicky with Bluetooth. Often it's necessary to restart, just so it recognizes the only Bluetooth device it's ever been paired with.

If yours won't take a charge, don't let it go down past 20% or so before resetting it. Once it's down to critically low battery, it is a nightmare to recharge. I had it plugged in (plugged in plugged in plugged in) for days before it finally built up enough charge to use.

Absolutely unacceptable user experience. Remember when electronic devices, like radios, had ON/OFF switches? You flicked the switch to ON and the device was ON. You flicked to OFF and the device was OFF. If you needed power, you stuck a plug into the wall. A 1930s-era vacuum tube radio sets a standard of usability that these sort of finicky present-day devices don't meet, and that's considering the necessity of swapping out vacuum tubes every few years.

Don't release these buggy things on your buyers, Amazon."
Nomad0848,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It works well. Simple to use for the most part. It took a little research to figure out how to get back to the home screen from in the middle of a book. The vocabulary definitions are disappointing. Some are quite inaccurate such as ""angular"" being defined as ""having little fat"" (I'm fairly positive that the edge of a limestone cliff does not need to be described as having little fat) and some are quite unnecessary such as ""barefoot"". So, I find myself looking up many unfamiliar words on Google anyway. The sad part is that these are definitions from the Merriam-Webster's dictionary which says alot about the state of intellectual accuracy in the world. Aside from that it is very convenient to be able to have 48 books in my pocket. Waterproof so I can read in a bathtub if I wish. (Although I would still avoid submerging it). Although it seems to be a bit finicky about some of the e-pubs that I have put on it, it seems to be quite capable of suiting my purposes."
SimpleMe,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted a simple reader. I thought the audiobook option would be a nice idea to use in the car during my daily commute to work. Absolutely annoying and nearly impossible to start up. There’s no way one could access easily in the car while driving. The kindle paperwhite 4 is so slow to respond with the double tapping and all. I’ll be using the book/audio app on my iPhone.
I was surprised by the slowness when turning pages or accessing any feature or function. It’s annoying to see constant ads and to search for books in one’s library. Trying to start the voice/screen and then needing to go back to the manual, I had to scroll through my library to bring up the manual to re-try the blue tooth set up. My tech suave husband and son gave up as the set up was so slow and unresponsive to the “double tap” this and that and then the paperwhite would freeze. You’d have to start all over.
So, the audiobook feature is useless.
I may need to rethink this e-reader thing and go back to a tablet, like a kindle fire. I wanted to get rid of having multiple devices that perform the same tasks. My iPhone does so much as a mobile device. With an e-reader, I wanted separation from email, messages and surfing, while I was reading. But I find the paperwhite slow to respond and difficult to use."
preschoolteach.....,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took getting two of these to get one that functioned properly. Although the first one worked it did not download book covers no matter how long I left it on the Wi-Fi setting. Unbelievably customer service wanted to give me a refurbished one to replace it, which I refused, stating that I purchased a new one and then it’s only days old, so you will give me a new one to replace it. They weren’t happy about it but they finally agreed to send a new one instead of a refurbished to replace it. I have quite a few books and it did take a while to load but it is working wonderfully and I’ve been using it ever since with no problems. I really like the fact that this is read only and not a tablet, As I have a Kindle fire but never use it because of that reason. I also had a basic Kindle without a light, that I gifted to someone else, who by the way is tickled with it. This person doesn’t have the eye problems that I have, so it works wonders for that person. I need a light and I like the fact that this has an adjustable light at an affordable price point. I use mine all the time and I highly recommend it"
Lisa from Arkansas,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My previous kindle is 3 years old. Also Paperwhite. It started ""refreshing"" itself so I knew from past experience its days were numbered. Then I got the rebate and trade-in offer. The KIndle 10 promised ""weeks"" of battery life (according to the Amazon agent it is estimated at 60 hours.) Waterproof was not an issue but the storage space sounded interesting -- even though I store very few books -- most of my books come from the library. I have now timed how long it takes to go from 100% to 99% (yes, after it was fully charged, and over repeated experiments on several days...) It runs about 15 minutes. So based on that 100% charge equals 1500 minutes, equal to 25 hours. I guess if I read one hour a day that would give me about 3 weeks. Nothing like 60 hours. I am keeping it because my older one is beginning to hiccup. But seriously -- WEEKS?!?!?! and 60 hours??? (oh, and this is on airplane mode and all the other battery saving options. Except that I do have background light at about 12 on the Kindle scale. ) It would sure be nice if it reached 50 hours? AND -- 8gb storage? the Kindle says 6.2 GB.... Though my main gripe is non-life of the battery. Otherwise -- I love it."
Lynne,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older kindle for years, and carried it in my purse to anywhere I thought I might have to sit and wait. It was simple to catalog my books, make notes in clippings or use the other functions as needed. Sadly, I started having issues with the print on the pages not being legible. I purchased a Paperwhite because it seemed similar to my old kindle. I did not want or need all the tech options on some of the other models- just a good little reader to hold all the books that I buy that I want to someday read.

While I realized that this new kindle would take some time to learn, I was not prepared for what I would find when I turned it on for the first time. All of the books (I hope) from my old kindle, the ones I had already read and the new ones waiting to be read, were all mixed together. For people who do not read a lot, or who do not purchase a lot of books to read in the future, this may not be a problem. For people like me, who have many books waiting to be read and may not remember all the titles of these books, it was a disaster. After about an hour of reading the kindle instruction manual trying to find a simple way to sort current and archived books with no luck, I called kindle customer service. After calling twice and speaking with 3 representatives including a supervisor, the only way I could separate the books was to download each book and look for the percent number that appeared on the book to show how much of the book was read. I literally had hundreds of books to go through. Some I obviously recognized right away as read and archived them, but there were many, many, many that had to be individually downloaded to check for the percentages read - which by the way was NOT always accurate - and it took me hours to complete.

My new Kindle works fine, and I getting use to the features. However, the issue of the books in my library all being mixed together, and the customer service representatives who it was obvious were not knowledgeable about this product give this Kindle only 3 stars. Very disappointing!"
BayAreaTexan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated from the 9th version to this 10th gen version.
Pros: It's lighter, screen is a bit cleaner. Haven't tested waterproofing, but that was a big draw.
Cons:
- The setup process was horrific. It just dumped all my books into my library. It didn't preserve things in their collection. And several books didn't sync across the devices, despite whispersync being turned on and my ""starring"" the collection
- I've been on chat with help for almost an hour. It seems the new version only has sorting/filter abilities, but the collection system is fundamentally broken.
- When using the web interface & kindle UI, I can't remove *some* books from my library on my device unless I ""remove them permanently from my account;"" other books don't give me the option to remove/delete at all.
- The touch screen is laggy as hell. I can click the ""three dots"" next to a book 4-5x before it either registers it, or I touch it ""just right"" for it to trigger. Terrible.

I can't see how this is an upgrade - the software ""updates"" are terrible and interface/UI is lacking. Was looking forward to this purchase, but have only been disappointed.

If you read this, consider waiting for the next version and/or for them to fix these software errors"
Celeste Thoms,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to love this and there’s so much to love, but the cons outweigh the pros for me. The Bluetooth works half the time. I have had 2 sets of headphones work great one time and when I come back they don’t work again. I tried a Bluetooth speaker, never connected. The screen is nice but collects fingerprints like nobody’s business. The battery life last a few hours if you’re using it. If you’re not it still drains the battery.
It works at the same speed as the last paperwhite and sometimes it’s slower. Now when you wake it you have to wait for it to boot up before swiping.
This is not an upgrade."
Charles Rooks,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I only gave this a 4 out of 5 rating because of the supposedly addition of Audible. as an E-Book reader its great, the screen is bright and reading is easy. Some of the controls are a bit slow, but its an e-reader so not really an issue.
If the product description did not say that it came with Audible this would have gotten 5 stars.
I am not a fan of having someone read books to me so this was not a real issue, but if anyone bought this to listen to their audiobooks it would be a real disappointment.
The description said, and i quote from their product page, ""Now with Audible. Pair with Bluetooth headphones or speakers to listen to your story."" However I have never been able to pair any Bluetooth audio device with it, in fact when I used the technical assistance it became obvious that this device does not come with Bluetooth. When you go to the settings you are supposed to see 'Wireless & Bluetooth' as a heading, it only reads Wireless.
The tech support guy tried to help, but was not able to get my deice to see or connect to the Bluetooth headphones. Also, Audible does not even recognize it as a device. I signed up for Audible thinking I would give it a chance, synced it with my Amazon account and it said no current devices.
So if you are looking for a nice small comfortable e-reader this is perfect, but if you are looking for a device to listen to your audio books, don't bother."
Glencora,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The one star is because compared with the previous Paperwhite, this one kind of sucks. It's sluggish and often unresponsive. When I go to turn a page, there's a lag; and sometimes the lag is so long that I think it didn't take, so I press it again, and then it goes ahead two pages.

Also, the display is not as bright. When comparing both readers side by side with the same brightness setting, the new one is much darker.

And while this is a minor thing, why on earth would they change the 'Kindle' name at the bottom of the device from black to white? It's so distracting while reading.

I should probably give it a second star for being waterproof but as I don't care about waterproofing and I'm so angry that they changed a good thing into a worse thing, that I won't.

If it ain't broke, please please please don't fix it."
Jace,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle has replaced my iPhone/iPad as my default reading device.
I really like the screen on the Kindle. Not only does it appear to be easier on the eyes, but I also like that it's wider than my phone.
The Kindle is good for books that are text only, not so good for books that have a lot of pictures, especially if they are color pictures. For those books I will continue to use my iPad or iPhone.
I subtracted half a star because it's slow. This is the 21st century, devices need to be responsive. With the Kindle, you tap and wait.
I subtracted half a star because the power button is on the bottom. It needs to be on the top or side like every other device in the 21st century.

Overall I would recommend the Kindle."
CatBookMom,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good: I like the totally flat screen surface, not having the edge between case and screen, nothing to gather crumbs, dust. Bad: it's a bit too easy to trigger a page turn if you touch too closely to the screen/case line, on either side.

And it seems more easily to shift from one page-reading mode to another than my old PW model 7. The older model seemed to be better about linking a set of choices/a custom mode to a particular book. In other words, your Custom reading choices don't actually stick as an overall or even per-book choice.

The most annoying - and it's REALLY annoying! - is that the little button to turn on/off is much more sensitive than the one on my Model7 Paperwhite. Often it turns itself off just by a little extra pressure. There's no actual 'click' step, just suddenly the PW shuts down. I've had it trigger by not being careful about how I hold it in my right hand. Or, if you lean it against yourself while lounging in a chair, you might trigger the shut-off by pressure against a fold in your shirt."
KR Ranch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Another update: I've had my kindle for awhile now and I'm still super happy with it. I was really worried about picking the right one since there are quite a few models but I'm very happy with this one. I dont know what the other models do that this one doesn't but it does everything I would want a kindle to do so again I would highly recommend this model.

UPDATE: so the battery life is only lasting about 2 or 3 days. I use it a lot though. Dont know if that helps anyone but yeah.

I've gotta say I wasn't 100 percent convinced I would like using a kindle but I started using mine tonight and I have really been enjoying it.

The backlight is great, the size is alright ( better than I would have suspected), pretty easy to use, comfortable to hold. The screen is good, easy to carry around with you.

Battery life seems good, this is my first one I've owned so I can't really compare it to a different model. BUT! I've used mine now every day for like 3 or 4 days now and it's at 19 percent.

Over all I would buy it again and I would recommend it. I dont see any reason to buy one of the more expensive kindles. Good price, good product. Good buy. I'm VERY happy with this one."
Wanderer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated-received repaired unit-it worked fine for about 2 months. It now will not hold a charge. I don't recommend it.

I write this as I'm waiting to hear from Amazon after returning this item for repair a second time. The touch screen failed after about two months of use. The device would randomly page forward or back, open the home screen, or open various menus, all without being touched on the screen.

I returned the device for warranty service in June. I had it back within the week, and was told it had been updated and tested; it performed properly.

That lasted until a week ago, when it not only started acting up again but doing it much more frequently, to the point that it became unusable. I contacted Amazon customer service. After reviewing the account, the rep asked whether I wanted it repaired or replaced. I opted for replacement, and an RMA was issued. My understanding was that a replacement was to be shipped. That's not been the case, so waiting to hear from Amazon what the disposition will be.

I've had other Kindle devices, and none have been a problem. I'm seriously regretting my decision to upgrade to this unit."
Paul Henry,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received my Kindle Paper White and already hate it. The settings section is useless, it is geared more for ordering products. In other words it is geared to make Amazon money. In order to adjust its settings I had to have a computer nearby to google how to use it. The first was how to adjust the font size. There is no search for questions on how to use it. The search is for purchases only, again to make Amazon money! Above all the really annoying issue is typing. It is very slow to respond! Typing anything takes a long time as it hesitates to display the letter typed. You tap on a letter then wait for it to show up, sometimes the letter doesn't appear then you need to tap the letter again, the response time is extremely irritating! I guess I am used to my cell phone where typing anything occurs instantly. I was also disappointed in searching for books with no color, everything looks to be grayed out. But I guess that's why it is called paper white, should be called paper black and white. I already purchased a kindle book for it otherwise I would be tempted to return it!"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Why, for the love of all that's good, would you put the power button ON THE BOTTOM?! Exactly where my hand rests when I hold the kindle? I'm constantly turning it off by accident, either when holding it or balancing it on a table. In fact, it's almost impossible to prop it up, say to read while eating or running on the treadmill. AMAZON, WHY?! This horrific design flaw completely overshadows any of the good points of the kindle. Also, ""battery that lasts for weeks""? Yeah, right, maybe if you barely use it. I have to charge mine every 3-5 days during heavy use (~3 hrs/day) or once a week for light use (~30-60 minutes a day) I WANT MY MONEY BACK (But not really, because it was a gift. Alas.) DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE SMALL HANDS OR WANT TO PROP UP YOUR KINDLE AT ANY POINT."
Suzyland,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Big disappointment, it seems like the quality of the newer generation kindle readers is nothing like when they were first introduced years ago. Some of my complaints are;
1. The built in light is a horrible gray-tone, not warm and not sharp. The bottom screen actually sometimes blurs out. Contrast between screen and print is the problem. Can't be reset.
2. The 'waking' time is much slower than previous generations.
3. Many times my new kindle does not wake and I have to shut it down and restart it - Very annoying to say the least. Sorry I did not keep my older kindle instead of trading it in for this 'lemon'."
Dr. D.J. Zaba,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After owning this for awhile, I don't know what I would do without it. I do like owning physical copies of books but I've realized that they end up just taking up space and if I have to move, they are very heavy to lug around. I can have a library of 1000's of books in my kindle and the choice of any other book I could ever want just a click away. I have kindle unlimited and I do read from the choice that it has but it seems any time I'm looking for a specific book, its not available on kindle unlimited so I end up buying an E copy. Or I can check to see if I can borrow an E copy with my library card which is another awesome feature. I was looking through the reviews here and looking through all the negative reviews and it seems like all the things those people are complaining about are just case specific. I've never had any problems with my kindle at all, no problems with the screen, no little light pinholes, no yellowing, or whatever else weird complaints people have, and the battery life is awesome and it charges to 100% very quickly. Another great feature is that you can connect Bluetooth headphones or a speaker and actually have the kindle read you your actual E-book and it sounds pretty natural and easy to understand, you can even adjust the rate of speech if its reading too fast or slow for you. That comes in handy if im reading something really good and I have to walk somewhere, I connect my Powerbeats and have it read to me while I walk. You can also use audible on your kindle for audiobooks but I find having it just read to me is fine besides the fact that I like actually reading and unless you purchase your audiobook with an E-book together using Whispersync you would only be able to listen and its more expensive using Whispersync. The only thing I could actually complain about if I was asked to think of 1 negative thing about this is the fact that it doesn't come with the case for it which in my opinion is a must have for it. With the case it magnetically seals closed and after your done reading you just close it and it automatically goes into standby mode and when you reopen it it automatically goes right back to where you left it. I purchased the fabric cover for 29.99 and im glad I did. I also find it strange that this new kindle paperwhite costs more than the kindle fire when the kindle fire has more storage capacity, much faster processor, and an HD color screen. But if I could make the decision over again I would definitely still purchase the Kindle Paperwhite for reading rather than the Kindle Fire."
StarWeez,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As a retired librarian, I am a tad 'old school' when it comes to books & reading. Yeah, yeah, the job title was 'Library Media Specialist,' because yes, we ushered in media and eventually computers, in the school library. But my preference, since the 1950's, at about the age of four when I learned to read, has been always been 'real' books - paper & glue, printed pages, etc. Riding my bicycle 3 miles to the public library and filling my basket with books, waiting for the Bookmobile on the schoolhouse steps...those days are long behind me. The problem with modern life, in my retirement, is that not all the books I want to read are published in the old style, or if they are available as a 'real' book, they cost 3x as much as the eBook. Even the libraries sometimes have only the eBook version. So I bit the bullet and asked for an eBook reader for Christmas. I did the research, read the reviews, and chose the Kindle Paperwhite with maximum memory and no advertisements. Some of the points I considered were: screen is easy to read in ANY lighting; small, convenient, and easily portable; designed ONLY for reading, without distractions of internet, messaging, etc. The waterproof feature isn't an issue for me, but if you read books in/near the tub or beach, maybe you can appreciate that feature. Do I love it? Yes, I do. But I still love holding a 'real' book and turning the pages. I think what I like best about the Kindle is the portability - I can shove it in my bag & read while waiting at appointments. We haven't been traveling since I got the Kindle, but I think I will avoid packing 6 or 8 books for a week's vacation, and turn to the Kindle instead. Also, I like the ability to borrow books from my local library and load them on the Kindle. I probably haven't used all the features of the Kindle yet, I am still on the learning curve, but it is easy to use so far."
Dferbrache,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my new Kindle. It's light & small enough to easily slip in my purse. It's about the same size as a paperback book. The screen is clear & works great in sun or dark. The ads aren't too bothersome & seem to be based on my past reading preferences. My only complaints are the limited text sizing - small, medium, large. There is almost unlimited sizing, but it's a bit difficult to locate that feature. I also can't seem to find the ""collections"" feature that allowed me to group books in categories. My categories are still there, but it's difficult to locate how to add/change these. This was an easy/obvious feature on my previous Kindle. It might be available, but I haven't located that yet. No big deal. I really like this version so far. And the cover that came in the ""package"" is very nice! Automatically puts the device to sleep to save battery life -- which, by the way, is excellent!! I've only charged it twice in 3 weeks, and that was as a precaution because I knew I would be away from a power source. The battery lasts a LONG time!"
Edwin L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having owned the previous Paperwhite generations this is a great upgrade. If a waterproof Kindle and the ability to play audiobooks are important to you, it's a worthy upgrade. My only reason for upgrading was the flush screen. I was tired of having to blow on my screen to get a flake of dead skin or hair or lint or dust from the edges of the older Paperwhite screen. The weight feels about the same to the older model and the screen is just as good. Some people would have liked a ""warm"" color backlighting option to help filter blue light, but I've been reading on Kindle e-ink readers for 5 years now and never had problems getting to sleep. I am sensitive to blue light on computer monitors and phone screens and use a blue-light filter on those devices. Never had a problem with Kindle e-ink devices, though. An excellent e-reader all around. Can't beat the Amazon ecosystem."
P. Kerns,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from a much older model Kindle reader. I was always happy with it, but it was very heavy, and it finally quit working anyway. I was looking forward to the upgrade. The only feature of this model that I am really crazy about is how lightweight it is. But it really reduced the page size down to much smaller than I was used to with the other one, meaning you have to turn the page a lot more often. The menus have been ""simplified"" meaning you don't have as many options for navigating through the device, and I have found this downright cumbersome. To navigate through the menus is especially annoying, as the reader frequently mistakes a swipe for a tap. But the worst thing is the battery usage. For some reason, this unit does not turn off AT ALL! it only goes into sleep mode. That means if you leave it for a week or two, when you open it back up, the battery will be considerably drained, even though you haven't used it at all. I'm very disappointed with this model, and have been a Kindle reader fanatic for years."
Retired in Bama,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It has taken me a long time to make the jump from paper and ink books to an e-reader. I still love the look and feel of a hardback book and will continue to purchase those for my shelf library. However, I now believe there is a place for both in my reading preferences. If you like to take notes, underline or highlight section of books for future reference, the e-reader is hard to beat. (Personal note, I don't like the idea being tracked and my actions monitored by places like Amazon but they are so beware.) Not only can you highlight sections of the book you want with your finger tip, the books also make recommendations based on sections that others have highlighted, scary but useful. If you read a lot of reference, historical or similar books, you will find this feature is nice.

The speed of the downloads were amazing to me. They were fast, timely and accurate. The selection of books and magazines is amazing. Some of the books I really wanted to buy had ""purchase perks"" (credits toward buying other books, think free) and that sent me into a book buying frenzy of books I have wanted but couldn't justify the hardback cost or space on the shelf in my mind. They are now on my e-reader. I'm sure it could happen but so far no book I have wanted hasn't been available for the kindle e-reader.

Being able to set up libraries for the difference books was great. I have 8 sections now for books and like my self library they are separated into areas of interest or relationships. This makes it easier to find any book. You can set it up under titles, authors, or subject matter, which ever you prefer.

No matter how many books you have open and reading, every time you start up the kindle e-reader it takes you to the last page you were on before stopping. I like this feature as it's like using an electronic bookmarker. you can easily go to the home page and open a different book if you like. It is easy to turn the pages back or front, go to other pages and even stop reading one book and move to another quickly. there are a lot of great features you have to see, the dictionary the back lighting, you can change the reading founts style and size.

Even better is I can now carry 50 books in my pocket instead of one 3 pound book in my hand when I go to places I know I'm going to have await, dr. office, appointments, kids practices or waiting at the mall. WiFi is not needed to read, just to download and a few other features, so it can go anywhere.

I think if we all traded in 30 minutes of time from texting and video games on the phone or kindle fire for a good read life might be better. Note you can read a lot of these book on your fire as well but the e-reader is specific for reading and no other purpose so it has a lot of better reading settings."
TecnoTofi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are an avid reader, this is a must have. Yes, we all preffer a real book, with the feel of the paper and all, but as someone who cares for the environment, trading that feel for the ability to carry all the books that I could want in a small tablet and help by reducing the use of paper, then is is awesome. I read about 20-25 books a year, so this plus kindle unlimited, has just been a huge step up for me.
No issues reading under direct sunligth. Battery lasted me for 2-3 weeks.
You just need to get use to the speed of the device if you never used a e-Ink device, don't expect it to be like a phone."
K. Frazier,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only had this Kindle for a couple of days, but so far I really like it! It is very VERY easy to set up, and very easy to use. I bought this to replace my Kindle Paperwhite Keyboard. While it still worked and charged and held a charge, the page turns were getting slower and slower, and it looked as if sooner or later it would not function as it should. So after a little over nine years, I traded it in and bought this one.
The words are crisp and clear and I appreciate being able to adjust the back light down to a better level for my eyes. And there are no flaws in the screen or the case - it is perfect. I purchased the one with the ads, but they do not bother me at all. They are only on the wake-up screen for a brief moment as I swipe to open the Kindle. I’m not going to waste the money to remove them since they are a non-issue. Overall, I am impressed with this Kindle...and I'm sure those of you reading this review are thinking ""She SHOULD be impressed since she was using an ancient Kindle!"". :)

Update edit: I've used this for a few weeks now, and have to say that the battery life is impressive! The battery lasts far longer than my previous Kindle and I've only had to charge it once. (I do rotate digital and regular books - I am usually reading two to three books at the same time.)"
TK,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a former Kindle 3 owner, and for a long time I saw no reason to upgrade. But eventually the Kindle Keyboard stopped holding a charge and got really sluggish. Still, hard to complain, it lasted me seven years. After the Kindle died, I converted all my books to new formats or read on the Kindle app via an Asus Zenpad S 8.0 and it was a rather pleasant experience. I really liked it with its 2k resolution screen, and Moon Reader+ is a wonderful app for reading, so I was reluctant to update to a new Kindle. Just wanted to provide some background for my perspective.

The new 2018 Kindle has blown away my expectations. Initially I didn't like it. ""It's too small"" I said, after reading on an 8"" tablet, but I adjusted quickly enough and am finding reading to be an enjoyable experience again. It's simple, the UI is much faster than my old Keyboard model, and getting more books is always a simple affair with Amazon. The Goodreads integration is nice as well.

Initially I felt the backlight was too bluish but I got used to it. I still feel the device would benefit from some yellow or reddish LEDs for night reading, but just dimming it down is fine. The reading experience is great in any lighting, from bright sun to a pitch black room, and the lighting control is great.

I've read of battery life issues and light pinholes on the screen but I've experienced neither issue. The screen on mine came flawless, and the battery life has been what I expect. I've finished six books since purchasing it and am reading the seventh now. I've charged it twice now, but the first time the battery was still around 50%, and the second time it was only down to 79%, so really I've yet to do a full 100% charge after 6+ books and over 3 weeks of use. I will say I usually have the light somewhere between 6 and 11, so maybe those with battery issues are keeping a brighter screen. At high brightness it looks too much like a tablet display to me, and I prefer only enough light for comfortable reading.

Lastly, I'm not sure when Amazon added it, but the ability to use custom fonts is a godsend. I love Google's Literata font, and it looks great on the Kindle and is very easy on the eyes. I'm not sure if this is common, but I read with small line breaks and the second smallest font option, and it's all great. I love this as a feature, and it should have been a thing years ago.

The 2018 Paperwhite is absolutely worth the purchase, especially if you don't have a Kindle or are upgrading from an older model.

======================================

Update - 3/15/2019 - this morning I opened my Kindle to a completely garbled screen. Unreadable from books to interface, and I was briefly concerned the screen had been damaged. Held the power button down, fumbled for the restart option, and managed to get it to reboot... and then it was working normally again.

This is the second time my screen got weird. The first time the entire bottom row of pixels in the book I was reading was showing at the top of the screen. This time, all the lines were cut in half and split all over the page. I'm docking a star, as this thing has some serious software bugs if the screen can wig out that way twice in the six weeks I've had it. Frankly, I'm tempted to dock two stars on the review simply for it making me think my screen was broken just outside the return period...

======================================

Update 12/22/2019 - The new Paperwhite is still going great for me.

Unfortunately even after software updates, it still does that garbled screen thing every now and again. I finally remembered to take a photo of the issue for this review. Happens maybe every month to two (maybe once every 5-6 books I read?). Doesn't seem to be any sort of hardware defect and rebooting fixes it. Pretty sure the behavior's not normal but the issue is minor and I don't really wanna deal with the return process, setting up my collections and stuff again (I mean, I've got like 700 books on the thing), and so on. So not really a big deal to me, and I still like the device."
makismom,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to use the Kindle app on my iPad Mini, but the battery always ran out before the flight was over! So I decided to take the plunge and purchase the Paperwhite. I didn’t carefully look at the measurements beforehand and it was smaller than I pictured it (smaller than the iPad Mini), but no matter. I do read at night with my glasses off, so I use a pretty large font, and it definitely calls for a lot of page turning with that combo! I wish I could make it a little brighter, so I can read with the bedside light off when hubby is snoozing. I have it on the max brightness and could use a little more. I feel like the controls for adjusting brightness and font size, etc, are a little clunky, but at this point it’s worth it for the battery life. I have yet to drain it, so not sure how long the battery will last. As much as I love “real” books, the Kindle Paperwhite is a great solution for traveling, as you can access so many books. (And frees up battery life of the iPad for checking email, social media. Games, etc.)."
fxtrtr,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my Voyager for this newer Kindle. The first thing I noticed was how much slower this Kindle responds to page turning and scrolling through your library compared to my older Kindle. It is very noticeable to the point I almost regret trading mine in. I hope Amazon comes out with an update that will make this more responsive as I feel it is the system itself.
What I like about this Kindle is it is waterproof and you can listed to your Audible books on it and books with audio. That was my reason for upgrading.
I cannot comment on battery life yet - I only just got the Kindle. Hopefully it will be as good as the Voyager was.

Update - I've now reduced my rating by one star - this Kindle does NOT have the same battery life its predecessor did. I fully charged it and within a couple of days it was down to 30% and I wasn't using it. I'm doing a test today - I am fully charging again and I turned on airplane mode. I want to see how long the battery lasts. If it runs down quickly again, I'm returning to Amazon for a replacement."
Ferrell Roddy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Actually, I traded in my 2015 Kindle Paperwhite for the latest version in Kindle Paperwhite 2018. The latest edition meets every expectation I ever thought of plus wished for. Pairing with my wireless Bose SoundSport Free Truly Wireless Sport Headphones - Black - Amazon audiobooks sound crystal clear. Actually hard to stop listening once you start. Manageability of the device is so user-friendly, great features plus specifications. The review on Amazon was a major part for me purchasing the Kinle Paperwhite. I highly recommend the newest Kndle Paperwhite to ALL."
C. Wilson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I give this kindle 4 stars because it’s slim and light and does exactly what I need it to HOWEVER I feel like I’m working on a computer with MSDOS Seriously, I traded in my 2012 kindle and other than lighting and being more waterproof I don't see any difference in the quality or ease in use.
The things that drive me nuts:
1) Very hard to see words and pictures when sorting or shopping on home or kindle store screen hence the 1980’s quality 2) changing pages are difficult. Swipe or touch one side and you might change the page or it might change 3 pages. 3) I was reading my books on a 1st generation iPad on the kindle app. It is way clearer and easier to use and 4) it took me forever to figure out a night mode with a black screen (FYI - all settings and accessibility). I would not recommend this and I would not buy it again but I’m not mad and I will continue to use it. It does what it needs to do but being that it is 2019, Amazon really needs to upgrade the screen quality to more like their Fire product. I would not recommend paying more than like $40."
Friendly Midwesterner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always used the kindle app on an iPad to read and like that I can make the screen very bright while also enlarging the text for my vision loss without reducing the page to a mere 3 words. Therefore I have resisted Kindle for a long time.

Because I was traveling more, I decided to give this a try. I wanted something a little lighter that had less glare. I am not able to read my iPad well in the sun but this Paperwhite is easy to read outdoors at poolside or beach. The waterproof feature was a plus.

What don’t I like about it? I do wish the screen was a bit larger. I also wish the text was a bit more crisp—feels like you lose a little of that with the anti glare, but I would prefer the anti glare if I had to choose. Unlike an iPhone, there is no adjustment to make the light “bluer”. It is a creamy color at the brightest. This is a problem for my own vision issues and I like how iPhone lets you make the background warmer or cooler. Maybe this will be a feature in the future. I spent considerable time adjusting font style, size, etc and you can save your custom profile easily. I also bought a cover with a hand strap that makes it easier to hold in one hand. All in all, glad I bought this and will relegate the old iPad to games at this point."
Thomas Richards,4.0 out of 5 stars,"**Update** - I added a photo showing the glare on the Kindle Paperwhite 10 vs my Kindle 5. The glare is exactly the same. Anything with a screen will cause glare. The glare problem is also solved by just adjusting the Kindle position.

I have been wanting a new Kindle for awhile now and finally decided to take the plunge. After reading many of the negative comments; I was worried about the unit. However, after it arrived I am no longer worried and very happy with my new Kindle Paperwhite. I'll tackle some of the key complaints with my opinions:

*Screen Glare* - I held the new Kindle Paperwhite and my Kindle 5 under the same light. I noticed the same amount of glare on both screens, nothing different. I don't see this as a big deal, it is still a digital screen and 100x's better than a gloss screen like my cell phone. I'll still be able to read in daylight without issues.

*Blue Backlight* - I kinda like it. Blue is very soothing and I read last night in bed with no issues. At lower intensities the blue is less pronounced.

*Battery Life* - so, I've had the unit less than 24 hrs so I can't fully comment on the battery life. However, I noticed a tremendous amount of junk turned on by default that would drain battery life so I turned them off. I also bought the version without supported ads so there won't be constant network comms. The things I disabled:
Goodreads
Home Screen View - turned off their recommendations
Next in Series

I haven't noticed significant smudge on the screen, I'll update my review if it ends up becoming a problem. The only reason for a 4 star is that I had to turn off a bunch of things that were enabled by default and were annoying. Overall I'm really happy with it and look forward to 5+ years with it!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the old Gen 2 Kindle, I loved it and it still works beautify. I put off buying a new Kindle because I loved the way the folder system worked on the Gen 2 and wasn't sure if that was available on the new versions which looked more like the Fire. The folder system is accessible for this new version (grouping books in folders). I love the smaller size while the screen is about the same size as the Gen 2. The backlight isn't too bright and is a comfortable soft light. I don't need to keep charging this as it keeps a charge for a long, long time. The very large storage is more than enough for my collection and I love that the touch screen is not too sensitive. I also love that this is waterproof making it easy to use at a pool, on the beach or even while taking a bath. I would definitely buy again."
Carrie Timlin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been with Amazon a really long time and often considered getting a kindle. I tried using the Kindle app on a tablet years ago, and although it was a novelty, the heavy tablet was uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time and the glare was annoying. That tablet quickly became defunct.
Fast forward to present day - I ordered this Kindle during the holiday sales, and I couldn't be more pleased. Small size, lightweight, and easy to hold. The adjustable settings mean I can make the font LARGE which is nice with my increasing age :/ I get tired of reading small font on my phone throughout the day.
The Kindle is single function, so you can focus on reading and not get lost on FB or other apps. Matte screen = no glare. I have had no issues with battery function, but it's only been a week and I use it primarily at home with wifi. The waterproofness is nice to have as I do occasionally read in the tub! I love that Amazon has offered payment plans this year to make some of their items more accessible."
J. Shabel,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I keep having trouble with the ""new"" Kindles I've received since I lost my old one. The new ones all had a window that pops up that prevented me from continuing to read. The choices are restart, cancel and one more that will cause the kindle to reboot so I either lose my place or have to wait to reboot. It seemed to happen more often at the gym when I was on the elliptical machine so wondering if the button on the bottom was activated by the place holder of the machine. I never had any issues with my ""old"" one that I lost. Also, sometimes the page I'm on will jump without me doing anything. I've received 3 ""new"" ones to use and now they're saying they didn't receive my second one that I returned. And now Amazon can't be reached to help with that. Ugh!! Looks like the new update didn't do enough testing since all three had the same problems."
Griffin Wiebel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my years-old Kindle Paperwhite for this new generation. I didn't think much of it, expecting the same standard reading experience I've had. For the most part, it was, but the subtle features and touch ups added was more than worth the price.

First off, I've had no backlight bleeding as others have reported with the light uniformly shining on the device. I would like to see a feature where a double tap or hold of the power button would toggle the light on/off, making it easier to turn on in the dark instead of blindly fumbling around with the touchscreen.
Second, the light nature of this device makes this comfortable to hold one-handed and carry on the go. It's indredibly light, though not much lighter than previous generations, as Amazon is trying to make it seem.
Third, the high ppi screen makes reading a joy on this device. The crisp appearance of every letter and picture is outstanding. The letters on the page of a Kindle can be easily mistaken for that of an actual book. It really is that good.
Finally, the battery life. I haven't drained my battery yet and have plugged in my device every few weeks or so. This could easily last though a long trip or stay.
There are other standout features that have been added to the Kindle this generation, such as waterproofing and Bluetooth support. I haven't had the chance to utilize these features, but for what I use my Paperwhite for now, it is well worth the price. Just make sure you have a few Kindle books or audio books first!"
WhiteDog,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this new model, 10th generation, Kindle Paperwhite to replace an old one that was beginning to show signs of failing health. The first one I received, however, had a flaw. When used with a case, either the metal one that is custom made for this model, that turns it on and off when opening or closing, or the old cardboard and cloth one from my previous Kindle, this model would freeze with some regularity. Without a case it worked just fine. When I called Amazon technical support, no one else seems to have experienced this problem, but Amazon made replacing it fairly easy just the same. I doubt they actually took the time to test it; they probably just tossed it in the recycle bin and sent me a new one immediately. The replacement model seems to be working fine. What was particularly nice is that I could set up a tech support phone call directly on the Kindle, and they called me back right away. I give Amazon high marks for their customer support.

The higher screen resolution means type is no longer fuzzy. There are more fonts to choose from. Battery life is better and the WiFi is stronger. Which means that I can order additional books directly on the Kindle, whereas I previously had to use my computer. Downloading with the old Kindle was problematic. This new one downloads a book as soon as I purchase it. Most important, for me, is that I can adjust the type size, screen brightness and layout for easy reading. My eyes are photo-sensitive so the ability to dim the screen to reduce glare is important to me. And the screen is evenly illuminated, unlike the screen in my old Kindle. Indeed, Amazon offers three kinds of Kindle; I think the old e-ink versions are still available. Then there is the ever improving Paperwhite, which works well for me, where the other models would not. And, of course, the full color Kindle Fire, which is a full featured color tablet.

I haven't tested it's water resistance yet, but being water proof means that I can read it in the bath with less concern about getting it wet. Even the cloth covered metal case is water-resistant. So, all in all, this is a much improved version of the Kindle Paperwhite. Although I'm glad I waited to upgrade. The new feature set is impressive. Also, it is much lighter than my previous Kindle, which was by no means heavy. So the added weight of the case is welcome.

Further, Amazon makes it easy to set up the new Kindle, linking it to my account. One drawback, however, it that, while it lists all my previous purchases, which are in the Amazon cloud, I have to download them one at a time, which is tedious to say the least. A ""download all"" option would be nice. The new Kindle has much more storage so all my books would hardly make a dent in what it can hold. My old Kindle was not nearly full, with more than 150 books.

While I still like old fashioned paper books, I don't have room for many more in my apartment. Of course I could toss many of my existing volumes, which I will probably never read again. But that would involve making difficult choices. And Kindle books are usually much less expensive. So I'm reading more as a result. Though the cost still add up.

Even though the first one was flawed, Amazon made it easy to get a replacement, so I'm still giving this new Paperwhite high marks. As the saying goes, all's well that ends well."
Bookwyrm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the new Paperwhite Kindle. Previously, I used an older Paperwhite (I think the first one that came out) and loved it as well. The new one has a flat bezel, which I like better, and the device just seems faster and more intuitive in general. I love having a device just for reading, especially in bed, and the Paperwhite Kindle does not hurt my eyes or cause a glare. I am able to sleep just fine after reading on this device, unlike the problems I have sleeping after using my iPad or phone before bed. Lightweight and waterproof (I read in the tub often but have not yet dropped my Kindle into the water!), this latest iteration of the Kindle Paperwhite is well worth the money. If you want a device JUST for reading and not for web surfing or anything, this is the one to get."
Lazarus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You know I was skeptical of this thing at first a lot of devices claim good battery life and glare proof screens and I've always enjoyed kindle's being an avid reader but most of the time their battery consumption estimates are under the absolute best conditions (not connected to wifi, screen brightness all the way down ect). At first look out of the package the battery was reading 97% and dropped to 95% in just about 30min of playing around with it. I stuck it on a charger for about 20 min and it showed 100% I haven't plugged it in since. I got this kindle on 02/12 its been 12 days and I haven't plugged it in once. I read on it every day for at least an hour and some days for 4 or 5 hours at a time, I haven't disconnected it from the Wifi and the screen brightness has been at about 75% or setting 18 which is plenty bright to read with in direct sunlight. The Battery is currently showing 54% after all that use and I for one couldn't be happier. Now the bad... to be honest all the things I don't like about it are simply preference things like it doesn't show the book progress bar like my kindle fire does unless you open up the multiple page view for going through the book quickly but not reading, That's kind of annoying. I have big hands (wear an XL glove) but the device itself is too wide to manipulate easily with one hand. Also accessing the settings menu is actually too easy, I wish amazon had made it a swipe down but instead you just touch anywhere in about the top inch and a half of the screen and the menu opens this is annoying because sometimes the settings menu opens when I was just trying to turn the page. also wish it wasn't all black and white but I know that's a trade off for battery performance so I can't be too mad about that. All in all its a pretty amazing little e-reader and I couldn't be happier with the experience of using it, its become my new go to device and I've got at least 4 to choose from. Good Product worth every penny.

(side note: I am not a professional reviewer, I did not get paid to review this product nor did I receive a discount of any kind on it I paid full price and just wanted anyone on the fence about buying it to know how good it is, and some of the downsides. I don't review things very often unless they are really good)."
HD,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to love this, I traded in my old kindle paper white for this one. The lowest brightness is insanely bright, and the battery life is crap. I used to be able to read for weeks, and I read a lot. Now I can only read for a week, maybe two. I loved my paper white because it didn’t bother my husband when I read in bed, now the lowest setting it is as bright as the surface of the sun and the battery barely lasts. Super disappointed."
LoopGaroo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been into ereaders since 2007. I have owned nooks and kindles and this 4th edition paperwhite is the best so far. Clear and crisp text (300 dpi). There is nothing to dislike about this eink-reader. Alot of people complain that it should be ""bigger"" but when you look at it --- you can only read so fast! An average person can read maybe 3 words per second. So what are you going to do with the rest of the text on the page? Their just sitting there! So I think the 6 inch ereaders are the perfect size."
Stalwart,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had several previous Kindles - one that was not backlit and two paperwhites, and then this one.

Differences:

Waterproof. I spilled my milk on my previous one. It cleaned up OK, but I am apparently becoming more of a klutz, so this might be a nice feature. I don't soak in the tub with it (my daughter does with hers), but I'm not complaining about the waterproof feature.

2X Memory: Even with 13 pages of book titles on my home page, I only had my old Paperwhite half full. So now, I only have this new Paperwhite about a quarter full. If I put more books on it, they just get lost in the clutter, so the additional memory is of limited interest.

Battery: About the same, as far as I can tell.

Screen clarity: About the same.

""Grip-ability"": Not the same. The new waterproof Paperwhite is slicker around the edges, so is a bit harder to grip securely. Not much, just a noticeable amount.

Speed: The new waterproof Paperwhite takes a few seconds more to wake up than my older Paperwhite did. That throws off my start-up rhythm, but it is really not too objectionable.

All in all, the main reason I upgraded is that my old Paperwhite was not behaving correctly and a hard reset did not restore it. So I moved up to the latest, and I am not unhappy. I also would not have been unhappy if my prior Paperwhite had continued to work properly. But it didn't, after providing me with several years of excellent service."
Lee Tee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since I have only used it every night for the last six weeks I don't know if that will be long enough to qualify me to review it but so far I love it. I have had six previous Kindles - All, but the first one that I purchased in 2013, have been Paperwhites. I still have two other Paperwhites. One stays in a specific room of the house and the other is a backup. Referencing other Review complaints I have read: I like the easy touch of the button on the bottom. I like that it is lighter and thinner than my previous Paperwhites. I really like there is no raised bezel. I do not use it near water so I can't comment on that. I don't know how to compare my battery life experience with other Reviewers. My Paperwhite is on for eight hours every night, sometimes hibernating, and I have to charge the battery about once every week. That doesn't seem too frequent to me. Bottom line, I am very glad I purchased it."
Becky Newberry,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't say that I like this new Paperwhite much at all. And, up front I want to say that I LOVED my old one. It was great until it started acting up after 4 years. It's the reason I had to buy a new one much to my disappointment. I felt it should have lasted longer. Maybe I should have check with Amazon to see about repairing it. But, anyway, I bought the new one and right off the bat, it was disappointing. #1 it wakes up slower than the old one which is annoying. I have to swipe it 2-3 times to get it to open up. #2 it is much too ""sensitive"". I can hardly old it without it opening the top listings to go to other places in the Kindle. It is so annoying that it does that. I have to click on the story section to close it every time it opens up. My old one never gave me that problem. #3 it's harder to fined where things are. For example I still haven't been able to find out how to put the time where I can it above the story I'm reading. I had it on in my old Kindle Paperwhite and I loved it. It was a great feature. And, maybe it's on this new one, but I can't find how to get it on. I would expect improvements and easier to use in a new version, not problems that were not in the old Kindles. One feature I would LOVE to have added to the Kindle Paperwhite would be the ability to move my books around in the order I want them without have to ""open and close"" each one to put in the order I want to read them. But, then when I order more books, it all out of order again. Sure hope a better Kindle comes out in the future."
Craig Sauvigne,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a Kindle Keyboard many years ago and loved it. I like to read and had a large physical library of books. But the last time I moved, I realized how many books I really had. I used to want to own a physical copy of every book I had read because I liked the look of a full bookshelf. I took it as a badge of honor to show how many books I had read. But then I started realizing they were just collecting dust. When I moved, I ended up getting rid of 95% of my books and got the Kindle Keyboard. It was now time to get a new Kindle as that old one, while still working, has very poor battery life due to age and also did not have a built-in light. So on Prime Day, I got the Kindle Paperwhite. My first impression during unboxing was disappointment. The screen seemed so small! But after setting it up and then using it, the screen size is not an issue. In fact, I like the compact size. I think I would like it if it was maybe an inch bigger on the display but that is not a big issue.

However, there is one thing that does bug me and kept me from giving it 5 stars. The power button is located on the bottom of the device. When I am holding the Kindle, I tend to have a finger underneath for support. On several occasions, I have hit the power button accidentally. On the Kindle Keyboard, the power switch was a slider on the top. Not it is a push button on the bottom. Amazon, if you want to make this device a 5 star in my opinion, please either put the button back on the top. Or keep it on the bottom and make it a slider that can't easily be pressed accidentally.

Aside from that one issue, I am very happy with this device. I really enjoy it and look forward to many years of reading with it."
Neroos,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first Kindle I have owned. I do like reading from it however you would think by the 10th generation, Amazon would have annoying problems resolved. The most annoying thing is the location and sensitivity of the on/off switch. Why in the world would this switch be located at the bottom of the Kindle. When one holds the Kindle, it is natural to place a finger at the bottom to support it from slipping down. Naturally, this supporting finger will make contact with the on/off switch, powering the device down while one is reading. The second most annoying thing for me is setting a bookmark. One tap should set a bookmark, but not on a Kindle. It usually takes 2 or 3 taps to finally set a bookmark."
a.robo,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit: After an unnecessary amount of time speaking with customer support and arguing the facts, they sent a replacement out today. This was after I pleased my case, reminded them I'm within return period, and suggested I send it back for a refund outright. Omly then did they make the sensible decision. It should not have come to that.

I wouldn't say this device has a premium feel to it, but it feels great to use all the same. I'm upgrading from a 2nd gen kindle so my context is a little. I like the various light levels which makes reading comfortable no matter where I am.

But I woke up this morning to find a dead pixel/pinhole type mark on the screen that is exacerbated the brighter the screen goes. It gets worse.

When I chat with customer support, they insist I send it in to their technicians under a warranty service claim. ""Once we receive your device we will determine if it needs to be replaced we will ship your replacement to the address you provided.""

How about this - how about I return it outright, get my money back, and buy a Kobo? What a joke of customer service this has been. They should have sent me a brand new one THAT SAME DAY.

Hey Amazon - it's a long fall down from all the way up there in the clouds. Hope you packed a parachute."
Stephanie,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Thoroughly enjoying my first Kindle! Easy to use, battery lasts LONG (be sure to turn on Airplane mode and your Kindle will lasts weeks!) The design is sleek and easy to fit in my purse/backpack. Adjustable back light is great for reading during the day and at night, along with adjustable font style and size. It is not super quick, takes a moment to load from sleep mode, but loads the next page of the book very fast.

Cons: backlight is very blue, wish it were more orange/yellow. Touch screen is inaccurate sometimes. Smudges easily but I only notice when the backlight is turned all the way down. BIGGEST turn off for me is when I get towards the end of ANY book, an add pops up making it look like you've finished the book. I have to manually go back to the spot I was at and click through past the additional 5+ pages of ads about suggested next reads, to pick up where I left off. This has been a nightmare since the first few books I read were mysteries and I thought that was just how the book ended, with no resolution. My last book, The Woman In the Window, had an ad pop up with still 20% of the book left to read, and I didn't remember where I left off so I had to carefully sift through the chapters hoping not to spoil the book in case I went too far.

Honestly a great first time Kindle if all you're looking for is reading and no crazy add-ons. Be sure to check the % of the book read to make sure you've actually finished the book."
Kirk,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the kindle paperwhite, I had an earlier version and needed to replace it with this one. Both versions are a lot a like but there are a couple of little things that I don't like with the new version. One my old cover didn't wake up/turn off the kindle when I opened/closed it so it was either buy a new cover or do this manually, not a big issue just annoying. Also when I open the cover (new) it takes a little longer for the kindle to wake up. Again not a big issue just annoying. Other then those 2 issues I like the new kindle and I'm happy with the purchase."
Brett L.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Kindle Fire before going this route and was led to believe this was the best replacement device. It is light, it is bright, it has more memory. But the search capabilities suck rocks! Unless I am not using it correctly of unaware of a better way to set up the device, I have to scroll through many many pages of my library (my kindle is my main source of reading material) and the gray and white screen washes out the covers (I have vision problems, so another reason why I depend on e-readers) and often the titles of the books. And I only see six books at a t time this way. Scrolling my library by a list is just as bad. I get more books per page, but half the time, I am scrolling and I hit a book I don't want to open, it opens, I close it and I have to start all over again. And way too many advertisements for other books, most of which I have no desire whatsoever to read. Can anybody suggest a better way to search your library, change the settings, or do I need to start looking at another device?"
Illegit_Legilimens,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got the new kindle today and initial reactions are positive. I previously had the Kindle gen 2, which has been my love for the past 4 years, but it got a crack in the screen somehow. Most of my comparisons will be between these two. It’s very light, which makes me slightly nervous, but it seems sturdy enough. I keep my brightness settings low so it feels more like a real book and the display is great; haven’t noticed any glare that is more than the previous model. It’s display is marginally clearer than the gen 2, just slightly sharper. So much faster though, which makes sense given the newer tech. Unlike the old one I’m not waiting 5 seconds for a store front page to load. My old one had all the new updates so the UI wasn’t any different. I have heard varied reviews regarding battery life so might update later after I’ve been able to test it out more. My gen 2 could last a month of reading on level 4 brightness, WiFi on, and reading 1-2 hours daily, so fingers crossed that this one’s battery life is that good. Overall though, Paperwhite is still a great product and I’m loving this one just as much as the last. Just waiting on a new case now so I can protect the screen while it’s in my purse :)

Update: battery life is not as good as older models. First charge lasted barely 5 hours when it was updating and downloaded maybe 30 books. After updates are done and if I don’t go to the store at all, battery lasts about 2 weeks with reading 1-2 hours daily."
Ricardo Ortiz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"During this whole corona-virus situation I thought Id pull up one of my favorite books. ‘The Stand’ Now if you know anything about this book its that most people die before finishing this masterpiece.
I begin reading it on my iPad. After a couple hours of reading for two days I could literally feel my eyes being tortured by dryness, fogginess and strain.
I will have have to say that transitioning from a snappy iPad to a kindle was horrid. AT FIRST. It felt like going from the newest iPhone to the first ever released android. Buggy AND slow. But you get use to it. For a little bit over 100$ don't expect something quick and snappy. But reading off it is something that to me makes it worth the switch. It also makes me wondered why I ever chose an iPad over a kindle for reading. I have learned to love it. I also learned to love not having notifications distract me. My eyes no longer hurt and it really feels like I'm reading a physical book. Without the awkward hand cramps from holding a massive book. The only thing that makes me EXTREMELY DEPRESSED is having to cancel my Scribd membership due to kindle not supporting it."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was absolutely horrendous. Started off great, but after a few days, the books would randomly skip ahead 2-6 pages at a time. Sometimes words would randomly highlight. I restarted it many times, tried different books, but nothing fixed the issue. I tried to do an exchange but Amazon's webpage wouldn't let me. I sent it back and will continue to use my old kindle from 2010 until it dies."
scottbb,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The first-time use experience is horrible. Amazon's documentation about finding and using configuration pages on your Amazon account is horribly generic (basically, Amazon is optimized to get you through the purchase. Everything else about your account, managing devices, etc., is much harder to find and use by comparison).

I tried loading some reference PDFs onto the Kindle. Every single one of them had horrible formatting, extraneous line breaks, etc. Kindle desktop app basically useless. Caliber is a helpful app, but way too fidgety just to get PDFs or reformatting mobis) onto the device.

The actual reading experience is great. I have never owned an epaper device before. The backlight is fine. A little too cold/bluish for my tastes, but not objectionable at all.

Turning on the backlight is impossible with being able to see the device. I don't use highlighting, so I wish instead there was an option to tap and hold the header area for 2 seconds to toggle the backlight.

After 10 generations of design, the hardware is great, seems like a winning design. But the software, responsiveness, and non-Kindle loading and formatting leave *much* to be desired."
Matthew Harris,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally bit and took advantage of a promo that allowed me to get a discount by trading in my very old Kindle, which is not backlit. I am glad that I waited to send in my old trusty device until after I received the Paperwhite. It is possible that the device sent to me is defective, and I will try to swap it for a new one. However, this being said, without the back light, the Paperwhite is not whiter or clearer than my 2011 Kindle reader. While having a back light is a nice feature, it drains the battery, but worse, it gave me a headache - I attribute this to the bluish shade of light, being very harsh on the eyes, compared to having no light. My wife's older Paperwhite is a warmer color of light. If this result is not duplicated in a second device, I will update this review."
Tony Jacobsen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using an iPad for some time now. I had the iPad mini 4, which was a great size for reading on the Kindle app. However, it's still an iPad. I would get distracted from reading knowing that all those other apps were on there! Yes, I kept it minimal as far as apps go, but the temptation to hit that home button and check my email was too much!

After watching my wife enjoy her Kindle paperwhite, I knew I wanted one.

Lucky for me, my wife actually got me this one as a gift!

I'm very much a paperback kinda guy, but I know I'll get much more reading done with my new Kindle.

Perfect size, no glare, lights automatically in the dark, feels good in my hands and I can actually hold it with one hand and read.

Also, I'm very VERY much looking forward to listening to more audiobooks on this thing.

All of the stars for this version of the Kindle!"
D. Booth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the Paperwhite that I bought 5 years ago. But it has a bad pixel and the battery seems to need charging more frequently. When I saw the deal to save $40 if I bought it that day, I was tempted to upgrade. But after reading the negative reviews about the battery life, I hesitated.

If you read the not-so-fine print, however, you will see that this version is really rated for 21 hours of reading. That is calculated from .5 hours per day for six weeks with wireless off and a light setting of 13. My older Paperwhite has a higher rating of 28 hours based on .5 hours per day for 8 weeks with wireless off and a light setting of 10. I seldom turn wireless on, and my light setting is 19.

So, I decided to give it a try hoping that the increase from 212ppi to 300ppi will make it worth it. After it arrives and I have time to try it out, I will update this review, which really isn't a hands-on review but one based on specs at this point.

UPDATED Feb 2 2019

I just finished my first book on my new Kindle, and I am very pleased with it. The clarity of text is noticeably improved over my previous Paperwhite, and that was the most important factor for me. It is slightly lighter and slightly smaller than my older version. The cover is a teeny big slippery and not as soft as the previous version, but it's fine.

As to battery life that people have mentioned, this is what I found. I fully charged it, and over a period of 8 days I read a book that is 256 pages long. The battery is now at 79%. In other words, I used 21% of the battery to read one fairly average sized book. I'm not the fastest reader, and I clearly didn't sit down and read it from start to finish in 2 or 3 hours. I also didn't do any other functions like downloading books or changing collections or anything that would take away from the battery. So, it looks like I could read 4-6 books on one charge, depending on the length of the book. That is more than adequate for my needs. I'm glad I upgraded because I have a long reading list for this year."
Augustina,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the reader well lit but still easy on the eyes. I did not realize this reader did not include the cellular service. My mistake, I misread the spec sheet. I also did not realize this kindle has no active content available. I like to do a sudoku or word game after I am done reading at night or when flying, waiting for an appointment etc. Now I just leave my kindle at home and take my tablet which has cellular data if I need to download a book. I really don't like reading on a tablet but I also don`t like hauling around two devices. I am generally unsatisfied. This will be my last Kindle."
Jillian Knapp,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle. And I ordered because of going back to school, a leadership program I was accepted into at work gave a Kindle option and liked the idea of not carrying paper. I also like the Audible capabilities. But so far, not impressed. I traveled with it to test it out. and it is slow and changing pages and waking up. It glitches A LOT. I also entered my work wifi password incorrectly and can't undo it to login in and download new books. I have tried to delete passwords, and reset it a number of times, problems not solved. So far not impressed."
Secutor,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I take a lot of notes, make comments, etc. I find the keyboard clunky and response time slow. My fingers cover the letters' highlight block so I'm never sure I'm on the right letter. The word suggestions are ridiculously numerous and also jammed together, making selection prone to error. Correcting typos is a pain, I'm still not really sure how to place the cursor where I want to start deleting or making a change. Maybe I am doing something wrong, but when I highlight a word or even a paragraph, I am not always offered the option I want, whether to just color-highlight, write a note, or whatever. And why limit the audible book listening to Bluetooth? I modified with a lightning-to-headphone-jack adapter to accept a regular pair of earbuds. Kindles seem pretty high-priced for a limited-use, older technology that's been on the market for so long. I only got a new one when my older one failed to start up. I found out a long time later I only had to press the On button for up to a minute to get it going again..."
MimiB,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: still love my kindle. Enough that we now own a second one for family use.

I'm LOVING my Kindle so far... And I'm a physical book lover and advocate. But, you just can't beat the convenience of this Kindle!

What I love...
-all my books available in one place, wherever I am
-ability to purchase and read new titles on the spot
-how light and easy it is to hold while reading, compared to the books I'd been reading
-the ability to read like a book page during the day which is easier on my eyes, but the Upton for adjustable light as needed
-waterproof

What I don't care for...
-doesn't have the look and feel of a actual physical book
-turning pages isn't as intuitive, I want to be able to swipe instead of tap the corresponding side of the page, an action we've all come to expect... Also want to swipe down from top to access the menus. This isn't a big deal at all but they've made an almost perfected product. Why not update to allow users to swipe"
Ifyoulikepinacoladas,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So I bought the new kindle paper white waterproof version and thought it would be better than my paper white 7th gen. Turns out that the text, lighting and screen clarity was actually better on my old 7th gen model. The battery life is also much better on the older model. So a few things...if you want waterproof you have to get the new model. Besides that these models have identical 300 ppi resolutions, but the new screen seems muted and does not get as bright as my older model, which is insanely strange. So I’m returning the newer model. There is not enough improvements to warrant the upgrade and after seeing the screen and lack of clarity and dullness, my older model is superior. Kindles overall are amazing. If you are just getting your first kindle, you will love it!!! I’m a huge kindle fan and I also love regular tangible paper books, but kindle holds an amazing amount of books. Oh and one more thing, if you want to play audible MP3 audio books, thisbis only available on the newer paper white. However, you don’t really need this feature bc you can use your smart phone and play audio books easily that way."
NLWPS of Amherst,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered on Dec 8, 2018. Stopped connecting to internet Feb 2020. Shortest lived Amazon device I have had the misfortune to own. No way to get books onto it without it being willing to connect to the internet. Zero customer support for this product issue. Was advised that technical support would email me. No such email received. Will not ever bother with buying another Kindle Paperwhite. This was my 2nd one to meet this fate but at least the older one worked for several years before it ceased operation. I have a Kindle Fire and a mobile phone but I don't like reading on those devices. It seems e-books are not the future after all."
Gae A. Weber,4.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, I am one of those people who can’t scroll past a $2.99 book without at least checking to see if I’d like it. So, my original paper white ended up stuffed so full that everything moved at a snail’s pace and it frequently froze. So, when this went on sale, I just had to. I honestly don’t see a huge difference between the two, but the touchscreen may be a little more responsive, and the water resistance and audiobook whipersync are nice features. On the minus side, I loved my original’s leather cover, which does the auto-wake trick, but the reviews for this one’s leather cover were so sketchy I got two cheap ones (one of which already broke) and ended up using an old pleather one instead. It doesn’t auto-sleep/wake, but it’s soft and comfortable to hold.

Also, I don’t know about you, but both of my kindles have been annoyingly balky and slow a lot of times connecting or downloading or going to a book’s Amazon page. I don’t have the same problem with my computer or phone, so I have to think it’s just poor software/firmware/hardware on Amazon’s part.

It was the balkiness and bad case the lost it a star."
same,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the Kindle Paperwhite. I've had all the versions of it. It is reliable and makes reading a pleasure. This 4th version has all the promise of previous versions and only fails in one. The display is good. The smooth bezel does show fingerprints easily, but it's not a deal breaker. The one issue I have with this version is the battery life. It doesn't come anywhere near the lasting length of the previous Paperwhites. I've had it since October and it has improved a bit, but it lasts about the same amount of time as my Fire HD 8 rather than the stated 6 weeks on the product info. I know that I read more than half an hour a day, so that accounts for some of it, but I'm not reading any more than I did on previous models and with those I rarely had to give a thought to the battery life because it lasted so long. Turning the WiFi off increases the battery life, but then when I want to search for a definition or more info on Wikipedia, it takes more time waiting for the WiFi to connect. This intrudes on my reading...a bit like having someone come and interrupt me while I'm reading. So, if you have a previous model Paperwhite, unless you read in the bathtub, keep the old one and give this one a pass. I haven't been able to find what the actual size of this model's battery is, but it would be interesting to see if it has less capacity."
Saturdaychick,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my first Paperwhite and it is still working but on certain actions it would freeze up and need to be rebooted when I downloaded something or tried to add something to a collection, which, in all the years I've had it, had never happened before so I spent a lot of time reading the reviews and looking at all the questions and answers and decided to take a chance. I bought the blue one with the most storage and took the option for the case and adapter with it. It is a very nice product. Can't really comment on the battery life yet as when I downloaded a bunch of stuff from my cloud I recharged right after. It didn't run out but it lowered it so thought I'd get it back up. My last one was still great on battery life and I have to say I liked the layout of my old one a bit better because I don't like having that Goodreads list right on my front page next to my library. I think there's a way to close it but haven't figured that out yet. All in all, it is very nice, and I would recommend it."
Hillite,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use my Kindle mostly when traveling, although with the coronavirus lockdown, I'm using it daily. I love the screen light, and it's well worth the extra money. (I didn't think I'd need the screen light when I bought my first Kindle, but I was wrong; the light is very useful.) Battery life is actually pretty good; I find I can go several days between charges. What I really don't like is the touch-screen page turning. My older Kindle, which had clickable bars on the sides for turning pages, was far superior. With the touch screen I'm constantly moving ahead or back multiple pages when I touch the screen inadvertently -- way too distracting. Today my screen suddenly seized up, and I couldn't do anything to unfreeze it; I also couldn't turn off the Kindle, even though I tried several times. I put it aside out of frustration, since I couldn't do anything. Fortunately, when I picked it up again several hours later, it worked fine. I don't know what happened, but I hope it doesn't happen again."
S. Byun,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my second kindle. I was in love with my first kindle, so it was an easy decision to get another one when I lost my first one. After looking at the various versions available, I chose this particular one because I liked the fact that it had built-in lighting and waterproof feature, which my first kindle did not have.

As much as I wanted to love this one, it unfortunately has a major flaw that makes it usable. The biggest problem has been that it's too easy to accidentally wake the kindle up and drain the battery. For my last three trips, I put my kindle in my backpack with a full charge on, and without fail, during the trip when I pull it out, I would find it with zero battery left. I am not exactly sure why, but from my experience the kindle gets turned on too easily from the button at the bottom, and it stays on for some reason. So you cannot rely on this version to be used for extended trips.

In addition to the fact that it's unusable for travel, it also has few other minor quality of life issues. First, it takes few seconds to wake up the kindle. This was not the case with my first one, and I guess it's due to the fact that this kindle is more computationally demanding (from having more features), but it's still annoying having to swipe the kindle to wake it up and having to wait. Likewise, the operating system feels very slow and unresponsive to my touches.

At the end of the day, I am willing to give kindle another shot, but I cannot recommend this particular version."
shirley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used one other brand in the past but have had this kindle for a year now.
It has been great, very easy to use. Haven't tested the waterproof feature but I am sure it will work when the time comes. I also haven't dropped it but the built quality feels strong.

On the negative side, I feel the battery life drains in just a couple of days and I barely use the lighting and don't read more than 2hrs a day. Also, I find myself accidentally pressing the home/lock screen button and it's annoying, I guess there is a reason why phones have it on the right or upper side, and not in the bottom amazon!

I would like to see more reading stats, other e-readers have lots of reading stats like; vocabularies, reading weaknesses based on your reading behavior, speed, etc. Somehow I feel these stats encourage you on taking on more difficult books to enhance vocabulary and knowledge, I always enjoy finding new words that are even hard to define by context. And a books suggestions option based on personal preferences and not just on famous smart/rich people suggestions."
Jeffrey,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The 10th generation Kindle Paperwhite is a nice step up in that it allows one to also play Audible Audiobooks. This is done where the audio can ONLY be heard via a Bluetooth device. I believe that this is so since the addition of a headphone jack might compromise the waterproofing of the Kindle; also a very nice feature. However, given that it is only through a Bluetooth device can the audio be heard, I would have expected that the implementation of the Bluetooth capability be better. For example, using the device in a vehicle is poorly done. First, once the device is connected to the vehicle, the vehicle IS listed as one of the registered and recognized Bluetooth devices. The problem is once you leave the vehicle and return later. The Kindle does not seem (for me at least) to automatically reconnect to the car's Bluetooth. I have to manually reconnect it. While this may not sound like much of an inconvenience, it really gets annoying over time. My cell phone automatically reconnects to my car when I return to it. In fact, if I had been listening to an audiobook using the Audible app, once back in the car, the app automatically reconnects to the car, and the book resumes playing at the point I had left off. It would be great if this simple task could work the same way with my kindle. Having to open the Bluetooth dialog box, touch the connection to the car in the list, then get asked if I want to connect or forget the car, then after clicking on 'connect' the device connects. I then have to hit the play button to resume play. Again, while trivial in one regard, having to do this EVERY time is annoying. The only time the Kindle resumes automatically is if I turn the car off, leave the kindle in the car for a few minutes, then restart the car and only then will the device remain connected and the audiobook resume. Since the Audible App on the phone works so nicely, I am surprised that the same functionality in the Kindle does not.
But, I am glad that I CAN use my kindle for Audible listening since my phone can be annoying for this in its own way; everytime a call or text comes in, the audiobook playback is interrupted when I am using my phone in the car for Audible listening. I suppose that I should consider this a trade-off; no text or call interruptions to my book, but I have to pay for that by the necessity of re-connecting my Kindle to the car manually every time I get back in.
The other minor issue is having to go to 'Home', then ""My Library"" then having to choose from Book to Audiobook in the listing of assets on the device is a tad cumbersome. At least, my most recent book and most recent audiobook are shown on the homescreen so a minimal amount of navigation is needed to return to either.
All in all, the screen is very nice, the lighting is more even than on my earlier 5th gen paperwhite, the fonts are nice, and having Audible onboard is nice, and of course, the waterproofing (not absolute, but good enough for casual reading by the pool) is quite a plus for folks like me who live in Florida and are never far from the water.
For the sake of completeness in this review, I must also add my two cents on the resizing of the device. It is only FRACTIONALLY smaller than the previous generations of Paperwhite devices, so the size difference is not really noticeable; that is until one tries to reuse a cover from a previous Kindle. The 10th gen device is just enough smaller that covers for earlier devices will not work with this generation, so another expenditure is required for a cover; an expenditure not really compensated by a reduction in size of the device, since the difference is utterly unnoticeable outside of having to get a new cover."
PDB,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a little confused by the raving reviews about this device. It's not that it is a bad device, because it's not, it's just that it isn't very impressive in any way other than it reads nicely - something Kindles have been doing for a very long time. The light is quite nice but hardly new or innovative.

Other things to note.
1. I am a bit annoyed that it doesn't connect to Amazon's Whispersync network anymore, something my previous devices did. You can get around this by syncing on WiFi, but that isn't an option while I'm camping so it's a semi-regular battle of making sure I'm at the most recent reading location.
2. It is slow. Slow to load from sleep and slow to respond to most actions. While I'm sure this is an ""upgrade"" from previous versions, it feels more like a device from the early 2000s rather than from 2019.
3. Touch actions are irregular. Trying to highlight a some text or look up a definition? It isn't as easy as it should be. I gave up on doing both."
I love books,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bring back the old Kindles. They were so much better. I ordered this product and it kept going to sleep and battery lasted 1 hour . Returned it for another kindle and that one also kept going to sleep. I have had Kindles for years and have never been so discouraged. I want to order another one since I loved previous Kindle models but I am afraid to try for a third time. For now I am having to use a heavier tablet for my books to read. Please bring back the older models. They were worth the money. These are horrible.
Gloria J. Minnick,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this reader on November 17 and since then have gone through 4 of them, all with basically the same problem. I am reading along, enjoying my book, and the screen darkens and turns off. Occasionally will do a restart. You can turn it back on, but sometimes it does it over and over. These last two kept having a thing coming up on the screen that said Power Off and gave a choice of cancel or restart. I always cancel and it always turns off. I suspect this paperwhite was put out before it was ready, needed more research and work on it. I am so disappointed. It was a great deal and I feel very cheated that it does not work properly. I mean, 4 out of 4, it is a dud. You would think one would be good. I am trying to decide whether to keep the last one and hope a software update may fix the problem in the future. Just can't decide."
Patrick Diogenes,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Straight out of the box the provided USB cable could not fit the USB port. At all. This is the most basic level of manufacturing hardware, and I see from other reviews that many other people had this issue. Why is this still a problem? Amazon may be good at many things but it seems that they do not care to implement any quality control. I will not buy any other Amazon manufactured products."
Ms. H,2.0 out of 5 stars,I've had my Paperwhite just 1 year and I'm already having issues with the battery life. I am an avid reader and I'm constantly having to charge my device.
Florida Beach Lover,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have owned Kindles since 2009. As an avid reader I have been pleased with all of them. I recently purchased the new Paperwhite for it's waterproof capabilities as I like to read in the pool. I assumed (my bad) that this one would also come with 3G connectivity as my other ones had in the past. Trying to sync a book I had been reading at home and it won't advance to the furthest page read and I then realized that this only had wifi. I have to say that I'm disappointed. It was a nice feature to be out somewhere and not have to remember where I was in my book and manually advance to that page. If there's another way to be able to sync without wifi I'd sure like to know how to do it.
K.L.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded from the previous version.

I’m very happy with the new screen design that’s flat all the way out to the very edge—presumably done for waterproofing reasons. I can’t really compare new and old head-to-head because I sent my old Kindle back to Amazon as a trade-in, but the new one seems slightly lighter than I remember the old one being.

I love the audio capability; switching between listening to the audiobook (which I do while driving, cooking, etc.) to reading is seamless.

My only complaint is that the new version still takes a long time to process downloaded content. I’m not talking about the actual download speed, which depends on your wireless network, but the time it takes to do whatever the Kindle does behind the scenes to get the book ready once it’s downloaded. Also, moving from menu to menu is really sluggish; for example, when I want to categorize a book on the Kindle (which is really necessary if you have more than a handful of books on the device; otherwise you can scroll for *days* browsing for something that fits your mood) it takes ages to apply the category. I’d hoped that the new generation would be more powerful, especially since the larger capacity was one of Amazon’s selling points.

Overall, though, I’m happy with the quality and performance."
Isabela,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, even though I'm a total millennial and I read a lot, I've refused to buy myself a Kindle --until now---. The reason for that is, of course, I love to actually turn the pages, I love the smell of both old and new books and I like looking at them, I think of them as little treasures on my shelves. However, I seriously have no more space for books (they are EVERYWHERE). I also noticed that usually, Kindle book prices are drastically cheaper than paperbacks or hardbacks and that with the money I was overspending on them I could actually buy myself a Kindle --which I did--. Let me tell you IT IS FANTASTIC. It's so comfortable and easy to read that I completely forgot it wasn't an actual book. The upside: it weighs SO MUCH LESS than some actual paperback books, making it easy to carry with me and hold in my hand. It's super thin also. I've compared it with a Samsung S6 Edge so you can see the size. BEST THING EVER. Also, the offers don't bother at all, they are sort of like a screensaver. Super easy to use but comes with a manual and an e-mail with very clear and quick instructions. I can definitely say, Amazon Kindle has turned me into a believer... doesn't mean I'll never buy paperbacks again... but it will definitely save me some money and weight in my purse for sure."
Stacy S. Gottschalk,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I do love this new Kindle a lot but I have a few issues that made me unhappy. The big one that I had was that this Kindle is slightly smaller than my old paper white. The new one measures 6.6 X 4.6. My old one measured 6.8 X 4.7. I like to keep my Kindle in a cover so it is always in perfect condition. This new Kindle is to small for the case I had so I had to go buy a new one. This where I got very frustrated. I had to carefully read the descriptions of any case I was interested in to see if the case I was hoping to buy would fit the new size of this Kindle. Took me close to 2 hours of sifting through covers to find one I liked and would fit. So many of the covers I wanted said it would not fit this Kindle.
I do want to make it clear that despite the issue of getting a cover that fits, this is a amazing unit. It is lighter than my old paper white. I love the front lighting feature and I love the flush screen. It looks sleek. Just wish the size of the unit had not changed."
Janet,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed with this mew Kindle. Screen is not consistently responsive to swipes which is how you turn pages. Downloading my library - about 120 books drained the battery anout 75% and had took a long time. When I set to “recent” it displays books from the oldest first. Scrolling thru the library is tedious. Sometimes the page turns and other times I have to reswipe and it jumps two pages. I loved my first Kindle from probably 10 yr ago bit the battery has stopped holding charge for long. The Kindle Fire is nice though like an iPad is next to impossible to read outdoors due to the reflection on the screen, and it is quite heavy. No hesitation with page turning woth either of the older models. I had troed to order the 7th generation but 10 days after ordering received notice it wasn’t available and didn’t know when it would be. I ordered this one instead and am sending it back. I did email customer support about the slow screen reaction and was told that it was not supposed to be that way and they would talk or chat through troubleshooting to see if it could be fixed. After reading the reviews I see that I am not the only one with the same complaint about poor screen reaction to swipes. Had hoped to have the mew reader to take on vacation but am returning it instead and will reconsider buying another Kimdle when a better option is available. I have had good luck with 2 older kindles - this one not up to par."
Teotwawki Johnny,5.0 out of 5 stars,"4.75 stars would be more accurate.

No e-Ink reader is a speed daemon, so don't expect the latest paperwhite to be one either. That said, it does everything you really need it to do. (I haven't bothered with the experimental browser.)

The text (an images) are plenty crisp, the Bluetooth range is above average, the Wi-Fi range is fine. Kindle and Audible store access works as you would expect it.

The owner's manual doesn't state it, but in All Settings >> Accessibility >> Invert Black and White, you can in fact switch Black and White, for a negative page. Bear in mind that it can make images a bit weird, but for night reading (where I kick up the font size one number) it makes things easier on the eyes.

For Text To Speech (TTS) you need to activate the VoiceView Screen Reader, go through the tutorial, and learn the command gestures, because the regular command gestures DON'T WORK in VoiceView mode. It is designed for blind people, to get good use out of a Kindle reader. I get it that Amazon wants for us Vision-Unchallenged customers to spring for Audible recordings, on top of the actual book. Well, like most folks, I can't afford to buy a whole pile of books (figuratively) along with the audible recordings at 5 times the cost. I get the fact that audio books cost a heck of a lot more to produce. I buy Audible recordings for the books I like the most. The Aubrey-Maturin novels (Patrick o'Brian) narrated by Simon Vance are absolutely delicious. But what gets me is that my Kindle Fire can do TTS easily, without activating VoiceView, while my Kindle Paperwhite can't. The Paperwhite costs more than the Fire, but is less capable. Go figure. It wouldn't be difficult to easily implement on the Paperwhite.

It does not appear to be able to create Collections for audiobooks.

Anyway, the latest Kindle Paperwhite is worth the money, even the 32GB version I own. Big enough that I can download every Kindle book I own, 10 Kindle Unlimited titles and a bunch of Audible books with plenty of room left over. I never want to have to pick and choose which of my books I can carry with me. You never know when you might get sucked into an alternate universe with only your Kindle and a solar charger."
Jan,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This product looks like a reject from the 1990's. For a product called Paperwhite, I have yet to achieve a white page... this thing is so dim! I have the brightness all the way up and it looks like an old, yellowed book page. I also was led to believe it would be considerably lighter in weight than my Fire 8 HD... nope... they feel nearly identical to me. I am.visually impaired and thought this would be SO good for me because of the non-glare screen, supposedly better/crisper text, etc... but it still has a glare, the text looks like an old digital watch from the 80's and I cannot get it bright enough. Sadly, I am.bed/wheelchair/house bound, so I have no way to box it up and return it. Basically I have just dropped over $100 on a paper weight. Hey... maybe that's what they should have named it?!

I have added a photo to compare the brightness difference... the Paperwhite is on the left and the Fire HD 8 is on the right.
I think the only good place to use the Paperwhite might be if you're outdoors during the day? I am unable to go outdoors, so I cannot confirm that."
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had a kindle since the very first one. In all cases, each newer generation has definitely improved on those before. For me, the best kindle is the Voyage and this new Paperwhite takes a lot of what made that great and incorporated it into the 'value for money' design of the Paperwhite.

I like that the screen is flush with the bezel. The whole device is light and well sized. The lighting works fine; it's perhaps a bit more yellow than either Voyage I own but you really only notice that when you put the devices in direct proximity to each other. The lighting is very even and screen clarity is great,. Won't say its BETTER than the Voyage, which remains my favorite kindle ever, but for the price, it's absolutely a great choice.

Purchase of the device includes 6 months of Kindle Unlimited (KU). Haven't decided yet whether to turn that on (I'd had a subscription once before) as I most of my reading lately is library book borrows, which works great once you get your local library card and eBook account. You can't really borrow from the library via the Kindle, but it's easy to return the books you've finished. KU is definitely worth trying if you haven't before. Most titles in the program are independently published titles and there are definitely some gems. For me, I felt like there was a lot of mediocrity as well, but the good thing is, if a book doesn't appeal, you can just send it back and pick something else."
Salt Mountain,4.0 out of 5 stars,"1. I bought two, which somehow means I like/need this product, but there is another reason. It does not support overseas kindle shop! US amazon does not have a lot Chinese books, so I have to use one for my Chinese amazon kindle shop and another for my US amazon kindle shop. Of course you can switch between accounts on one device, but then you will need to re-download everything again when you switch back. I think in the future this problem will still exist......

2. I’ve been using iPad and smart phone for too long that I really don’t like the delay of kindle’s touch screen. Honestly it does not take more than 1 second to refresh pages, but it still feels slow.

3. I hope the LED light color could be warmer. Because it’s so blue, I’d rather not use it.

4. I really complained a lot...... but I rarely give low scores on things I bought. Maybe reading is just a very devoted activity. Any annoying problem can easily makes one feel unsatisfied.

5. Thinking about what I got from kindle, this is still a very nice product. I’ve owned different models. I bought paperwhite because it’s waterproof, so that I can read in my bathtub. It has done a good job."
dlg,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not what I thought it would be like. Very disappointed with it. I had a Kindle Fire for at least 10
years. That was great compared to the new Kindle Paperwhite. The old one had a larger screen for
reading, the books were in color, books were on a carousel that you just went through with your finger
to find a book. Books could be removed from carousel after reading and sent to the cloud. The books were also listed on the ""device"" or ""cloud"" for quick reference. Also showed what books were read. The new Kindle is in black and white. To find a book it shows about 5 books per page, none are marked read. You have to do it.
I still didn't go through the books to mark what I have read. Below the books I have, the page has books I might be interested in. Just more clutter for the screen. Just to be honest I hate it! If I can find a place to replace my
battery in my old Kindle I will change back to that one. The new Kindle Fire was just a bad as this one."
Anthony,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had 2 nooks. First, was to be different. Second was because of the adjustable orange backlight for night reading. Finally grabbed this one on sale. I prefer buying ebooks on amazon much more than their competitors. Mainly due to price and sales, and also to centralize my content. I do a lot on amazon probably like most people who are reading this review. The page turning and refresh speed is slightly faster than nook. I was angry when I upgraded a glowlight plus to the glowlight 3 only to find I paid 100 dollars for the same exact internals, no upgrades other than page turn buttons and an orange light.
I have no experience with previous generations of the kindle, other than the old fire tablet and the newer fire hd 8.
So far I love the kindle. The bluetooth connection for audible is great. Be wary though, if you like to read along, you will need a fire. This seems to be either listen to the audio and look at the audio page, or read silently.
I haven’t done anything with it being waterproof. It’s really useless to me since i don’t read in the shower, pool, or rain. But it still feels nice to know that if water hits it, I don’t have to worry."
Daniel S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd kindle over the years, and it's absolutely the best one yet! My last device was the 1st gen paperwhite. This new paperwhite improves on everything about the original. My biggest complaint about the OG, was the uneven light in the display. It could be really distracting when reading. That issue is gone now. I find it to be very evenly distributed across the display. The higher resolution 300dpi display is also a nice improvement.

It weighs less, it's thinner, and there's no edges on the bezels.

While I've only had it for a couple weeks, I can't comment on battery life in comparison, but that's never been an issue for me. Aside from vacations/trips, my normal usage is about an hour a night in bed. I usually get about a month of battery. I haven't looked at the battery remaining yet, but I'm assuming I'll see similar life with this one. I'm not sure what people are doing with theirs that complain about poor battery life, as this does not appear to be an issue with what I would consider pretty average usage.

I also read several reviews stating that it's more uncomfortable to hold due to the button on the bottom. I haven't found this to be true. In fact, my 1st gen was much worse. I always have my kindle's in the amazon leather cases (I got the waterproof fabric one this time), and on the 1st gen, it had a somewhat sharp cutout there that was the natural resting spot on my fingers. The new one is a much smoother transition.

If I had any complaints, they'd be two minor things. First, It took me forever to find the screen brightness settings. In the old one you just tap the top of the display and hit a lightbulb and the slider appears. Now it's buried under a subsetting, that's only visible while in a book. Second, due to the lack of edge on the bezel (which is a good thing!), I sometimes flip the page while holding the edge with my thumbs, if I'm not paying attention to the placement."
Mimi N,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Kindle was incredibly hard to get used to. I had it replaced within the first month. When I would turn pages, especially to new chapters, it would ""blink"" so significantly it was very distracting to me. I almost returned it altogether to go back to the Fire.

Now that I have the new one it's not as significant. It's still there, but not nearly as bad.

I appreciate the size of it as it's more portable than anything else I've ever had.

I'm still getting used to it. I wish when I added a bookmark or removed a bookmark it was only one step instead of three. I like it much better on my Fire and the app on other devices. Touch it once and boom, you're bookmarked or removed a bookmark.

Navigating the settings takes since getting used to. I feel like it's more complicated than it should be, but once I've learned the path to what I need then I'm set.

There could definitely be improvements, but I find it ok overall."
RDS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this! I love reading and prefer ebooks and am so glad I purchased this. I have been currently reading my books on my iPhone and after a while the screen would make my eyes tired as I tend to read for a couple hours at a time. I decided to get the paperwhite since it has backlight for reading at night and this thing is perfect! It’s not too small but not so big that it’s bulky either. Lightweight and very easy to navigate. It comes with the charging cable but not the wall block itself, but I have plenty of extras lying around. The Bluetooth is awesome for audiobooks for road trips and for while I’m cooking. I purchased the 32gb to make sure I have plenty of storage since there isn’t an sd card slot. That would have been a nice little feature but 32gb is still good. The battery life is great & you can adjust the text size, brightness of the screen & etc. It came with 1 day shipping & I purchased through amazon’s website and got 3 months free of kindle unlimited. I highly recommend this if you are an avid read and/or lover of audiobooks."
andrewstrauss,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works very well. Like the bezel-less design, water proofing, and battery life. Only thing it is missing is orange light. Also, I wish the power button was on the top so I wouldn't hit it while holding it."
Debra Z. Seemel,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I used my previous Kindle Paperwhite to store and read books, that part works fine. I also, about half or more, used my Kindle to store and use games and tools like Notepad Plus, Every Word Crossing, Sudoku, Chess, Checkers Calculator Plus, Word Search, Jigsaw Words, Mahjong, etc. None of those Apps worked on my new Kindle. I had traded in my old Kindle, so I had to find another Kindle of that vintage, on Ebay, so that I could use all my other Apps, besides reading books. Very disappointed!"
Dragonfly,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this during the 1 day MLK sale at $40 off the regular price. In the past, I have only had Kindle Fires: 7"" HDX and the 6"". I wanted a super light weight Ereader that I could read in bright sunlight. The PaperWhite is a mear 6 oz. Add in a Fintie Cool Jade cover and it is only 10 oz total. It is much slower than the HDX. It takes a few seconds to ""wake up"" after opening the cover. The entire interface is different than on the HDX or the Kindle ap on my IPad Pro. It will just take some getting used to. I really wanted the Kindle Oasis but couldn't bring myself to spend 2x the amount for buttons to flip the pages and an extra inch of screen space (7"" as opposed to 6"")

It is good for what it does: Lets you read your books in just about any lighting situation. No email, texting, FB, phone calls or Candy Crush. Just clear crisp text on your Ebooks. At 300ppi you can't go wrong. The adds? Personally, I like them. Good book suggestions. No game suggestions since it doesn't support games. I only keep two books loaded on PaperWhite: My current book and my ""on deck"" book. This is my secondary device that only goes to work with me or when I'm traveling. Four solid stars on the Kindle PaperWhite. 🌟🌟🌟🌟

Update: 2-26-19. I've had this for several weeks now. I'm really enjoying it. I love the fact that it is so light and adds very little extra weight to my purse. The cover keeps the screen protected and works to wake/sleep the device. I get many compliments on the Cool Jade cover. I've gotten used to the fact it is NOT a tablet but an E-Reader. I still would have liked the Kindle Oasis but I love the $170 savings. $249.99 vs $89.99 on the MLK day sale. More money to buy books. I'm upping my rating to 4 1/2 stars.

Update: 4-9-19. Two minor annoyances: The PaperWhite doesn't really sync with my other devices. If I read on my Kindle ap for IPhone or on my HDX the PaperWhite doesn't seem to know I've read on another device. (My Kindle ap and HDX always sync). Also the ads are non specific. I open my PaperWhite and the screen has a picture telling me the Kindle library has over 80,000 books. This happens about 80% of the time. My HDX always has relevant suggestions based on my reading habits. If you have ads, make them worth my time to look at. I still love reading outside and my 4.5 Star rating remains in place."
Mrs. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so excited to have this kindle. First, I never had any reader before. I am a person who barely reads, but have tons of audio books. I prefer to listen. I was thinking about getting kindle a couple years ago, but after going through specifications I was bummed to see it lacks audio books support. I was waiting on when Amazon integrates Audible and maybe mp3 support. While mp3 still not there, audible was added! If you have Amazon prime and audible user and you love to read, or like me hoping to start one day, this is great device to own. Before I tried to read on my tablets or phones, but there is always some distraction, you just switch to other ""interesting"" stuff in your device. Kindle is perfect from this point of view, even ""experimental browser"" pretty annoying to use, so you just read. You open the cover and here is the last page you read. And you keep reading. Not like on the phone. Some complain about power button located on the button. I have not had problem with that. I never had accidental button press.

My pros:
It is light
It is simple (no distractions)
Great display for reading
It has audible support (all my books in one place)

My cons:
I wish, that you could listen audio book on background and read at the same time. It is good when audio file has study book.
I wish it supported more book formats, but I guess Amazon wants that you get book only from them, which is understandable.

You can add and add features, but it will add weight and make device more complicated and battery hungry. So I love Kindle as it is - light and simple. For a week that I have it I read a 2 books and started another 2. It is almost how much I read in my lifetime :)))"
Mike B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally decided to use Amazon's Kindle trade-in program to trade-in my 2nd generation dinosaur Kindle for some newer tech. While my old Kindle still did work and had been a workhorse for years, the battery was not what it was, it was heavier, and the lack of back-lit light for nighttime reading was overdue for an upgrade.

This Kindle is very lightweight compared to my old Kindle, even with a case (Moko, Origami Slim Shell), which I purchased as an accessory item. It is almost as light as my Galaxy S8+. The touch screen works well, which is another feature I did not have previously. I can say my only complaint here is there is little room on the sides of the case to rest your thumbs when holding the device, which sometimes causes a page turn accidentally while reading. This normally happens when reading in bed, but it's not a huge issue.

The display is easy to read and I really like the paperwhite design of the display. Also, I very much like the device is backlit with a good range on adjusting the brightness as needed. I don't generally read outside much, so, for now, I have not encountered any issues.

I have had the device about a month and have not needed to charge it since my first charging. I usually keep it on airplane mode and the battery is going strong. Very happy with that.

The one complaint I have had with this device - and it is not the device itself, but with Amazon - the charging cable (micro-USB) lacks a power adapter enabling you to charge the device from an outlet. This was not the case with my 2nd generation Kindle as it came with the full cable and power adapter.

Then, Amazon conveniently recommends you purchase said adapter as ""official OEM"" adapter for Kindle devices for the whopping price of $19.99. This is a complete rip-off, in my opinion. The adapter should come with the device, but if you are going to sell it separately, you do not need to over-charge for it by this ridiculous amount. You can find another generic adapter for a reasonable price. Just be sure to make sure it matches the specs required for charging the device. Booo - bad form Amazon!

Even with the ""missing"" adapter, I am happy with the product and the value and price paid. I also very much recommend taking advantage of the trade-in program Amazone offers if you can. I was able to get a $5 credit for my old Kindle and 25% off toward future Kindle product. I also pulled the trigger on this sale during Prime Days so the device was further discounted. This was a great time to upgrade and save money."
Francis Roe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift from my wife. When I bought it Amazon was having a great sale. She absolutely loves it and is reading more books now than ever. I like everything about it especially the fact that it’s waterproof. Not having any experience in the past with the readers or kindles I was a little reluctant to purchase the Kindle with the least amount of storage however now that she has over 10 books loaded on it and looking at the amount of storage they take up, I have no doubt the smallest storage Kindle will be all she will ever need. It does sometimes seem a little glitchy and when changing from your book to the home screen the backlighting flickers from all black with white writing to all white with black writing and I find that to be annoying. We did a lot of research prior to buying a Kindle and one of the contributing factors to why we purchased the Kindle was so my wife could carry it in her purse easier than a book but also because the Kindle books appeared to be cheaper. However it seems after setting up and purchasing the first few books it’s almost always cheaper to buy the hardcover book then to purchase it as an e-book... I don’t understand how that could be possible?"
Bigtimereadingnerd,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If this is your first paperwhite, it's GREAT. But, the paperwhite I currently have is great and in white.:) Therefore, I returned this one. I did give it a good try. Really thought I would be upgrading, Honestly, it's basically the same and I don't need all the space for audiobooks, though that's a plus if you like audio. Also, the new paperwhite is easy to put finger smudges on the device. Guess that goes with being waterproof. But again, if you don't have one already, you will not be unhappy. The logo is offset from the black color on the new device but, as for me, it doesn't draw my attention away from reading. I do love the flatness to the bezel. As a person with pets, I didn't get various doggie hairs stuck by the edge of the screen. Also, my charging cord fit perfectly."
Kristine Rita,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOOOOOVE this Kindle. And that is coming for an avid ""book only"" human. I went back and forth for awhile before buying this and I'm so happy I did. Tie this in with the new Kindle book subscription, and I'm hooked. I have had a chance to read a lot of new books and bring this to work and while running errands, without the added weight of a regular book.

The battery life is unreal and still shocks me every time I open it up. The touch screen reads my finger very easily and I have no issues with changing the pages. The built in light is also a great addition. You are able to adjust the brightness to fit your needs and it does not hurt my eyes at night in low lighting."
Carol F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My 4th Kindle and at least my 2nd paperwhite. This one is smaller and lighter ( I think my last was at least 5-6 years old) . Except for work I am never without my Kindle. Like the idea that the current version is waterproof since I read a lot at the pool in summer. I paid the extra $10 or so for add free ( special offer) reading. Suggest ordering the bundle with the leather cover and the plug ( 5W USB power adapter) for fast charging . Then everything works and is protected and you save some money.
My old Kindle screen was starting to get a little scruffy plus the old kindle was having trouble holding a charge but the new cord and power adapter from the new kindle seems to have brought the old one back to life. So now I have 2 working ones and never have to worry that one is not charged or that when my family gets together at the lake that someone forgot their book or reading device and needs something to read. There was no problem with all of my old books being available on both the new and old Kindle seamlessly and simultaneously. Also like the audible feature for my grandkids although not sure I will use."
Terril Retter,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Paperwhite is mostly an upgrade from my earlier Kindle but there some things that are not as good. It is going to take awhile to get used to the smaller size and weight. I have the feeling that I am going to drop it frequently or leave it behind somewhere because it is so much lighter. The look and feel of the content organization will take some time to get used to. With the Kindle, I know which books I have loade and in what sequence. This is not as obvious on the PW. The home page organization on the Kindle seems to be more robust and more intuitive. Games, Apps, Music and Videos have their own sections on the Kindle and, so far, I am not sure if all these features are even there on the PW. The clearness of the screen is much better in the KW which is plus for mixed light situations.

I will be getting a cover for my new PW which I hope will resolve some the feel issues and some ot the others will probable be resolve with more use pf the new reader."
Christopher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First time Kindle Paperwhite owner here. Maybe I’m in the honeymoon phase here, but I think this is a great product. Glad I waited for this one. It’s fast, responsive, stores a very decent amount of books, and even has a dark mode (though under accessibility options it’s “invert colors”) which I’m a HUGE fan of. It’s lightweight and easy to hold; brightness can be increased or decreased signficantly to fit where you are; and it’s form factor is small so it’s very portable; and the charge lasts quite awhile. All-around, it’s a great product. I am very in love with it at this moment."
PK,1.0 out of 5 stars,"For starters, it was touted as having a battery life up to 2 weeks. It lasted a day & 1/2 and took hours to recharge...had to finally leave it plugged in overnight and go back to my previous Paperwhite to read in bed. After a few hours of daytime reading over less than 24 hours past its full charge, it's now down to 31%. Maybe they meant 2 days, not 2 weeks. :-(

Secondly, you have to poke, poke, poke at the screen for it to give up settings, page, time left, etc.

I intend to return it. Should have just stayed with my older one and not fallen prey to the hype."
Ethan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"10th gen? wow that was a lot of iterating..which is a good thing. I bought the new model
w/ special offers. The offers are tailored to my interest it seems, it even suggested me a book
I was interested in that was on the prime reading list (borrow for free)

Awhile ago i started with a much older gen, no waterproofing, or flat display design
(which I really like). Amazon has done well with continuously updating and improving the
style language, and functional enhancements.

This current gen, w/ waterproofing and flat display (previous generations the display was sunk in)
looks and feels better. The software has also come a long way. The home display layout is well organized
with 'Your Library' on top taking up about 65% of the screen, as it should (rather than focusing on ads etc)
20% of screen is suggested reading under 'New and notable in prime reading' which suggests new books to you,
not specifically tailored to your interests, then the ads ad the bottom are about 10% of the space, not really intrusive."
Bearry,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this when my previous Kindle died in the middle of an update and locked up. I was completely satisfied with my previous Kindle and would not have otherwise bought a new one. This one is nice--it has a larger screen since it doesn't have a built in keyboard. The built-in light is great for reading in bed. As others have posted, the power button is in an unfortunate place and is easy to accidentally press, particularly when holding the Kindle with one hand. I would be better place on the top, or be recessed so that it requires intent to activate. It took me a few times to figure out why my Kindle was seemingly randomly turning off. Once nice feature of this Kindle is the ability to create custom profiles with font, font size, spacing etc. For some reason, it doesn't allow you to save the light setting with the profile--that would be a great feature. I have one profile for ""daytime"" with a small font. During the day, I turn the light off to save battery. At night, I have a larger font that is easier to read when I'm getting sleepy. I turn the light on, so that if I awake in the middle of the night, and want to read, all I have to do is turn on the Kindle without needing to turn on the lamp."
SMH,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Use this mainly for reading books, for which it works well. It boots up much faster than a kindle fire. It also starts right where you left off, without having to go through 2 or 3 steps, unlike the fire. Easy to read, and backlight makes it easy to read at night."
Kara,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded my Kindle for the waterproof features so I can use it in the bath and I'm very pleased. I hated the ridge on my first Kindle, dirt and stuff was always getting stuck on the screen. This Kindle is a great upgrade, goodbye annoying ridge, and hello bluetooth and waterproof! I also love Amazon's trade-in program.

If you're new to Kindle - give it a try. I was a firm believer that ""books are better"" and ""why wouldn't I want the physical copy?"" but after owning a Kindle I can't imagine holding a book and lugging a book around. The Kindle is so easy to travel with, it's light and compact and you don't have to hold the book open... and when you're ready for a new book, it's instantly in your hands. Yes, I do miss having the books on a shelf at home and wish there was some sort of discount/program to get the physical copy at a discounted rate as well (or buy the physical copy and get the kindle copy for a couple dollars), but you can't have it all now, can you?"
Carol R. Harris,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t like the Paperwhite nearly as much as my Kindle keyboard which I finally had to replace after using it for 6 years.

It is not as comfortable to hold, and I can’t read using only one hand like I did previously since there are no side buttons to flip the page. It feels awkward in my hand. Tap screens get dirty too quickly with smudges and smears.

The functions I used daily are now all hidden in menus instead of easily available via a physical button.

This seems like a downgrade to me. Just because something is the newest, greatest, latest thing does not mean it is necessarily the best thing. I work in the tech field and have never been afraid of new technology – but this is a real disappointment to me.

Edit 04/08/2020: Some additional gripes on this Kindle. I wound up replacing this Paperwhite the end of October 2019, as I had to charge it almost daily, it kept rebooting itself, and at the end refused to connect to my wireless network to download content plus had multiple other issues. The new one did okay on those issues, but I find it very annoying that page turns are very inconsistent (sometimes it will go to the next page and sometimes it will go to the previous page), the font setting opens itself with no action on my part and resets my font size, and the reader setting to show the page number and progress percentage turned itself off just a few days ago. I had to go rummaging through menus to find where I could turn it back on.

This Kindle is not Amazon's finest moment. There needs to be some serious troubleshooting done on the hardware and software, and all these issues found and corrected. I have been a Kindle owner since the first one and always loved them, but this one is trying my patience."
Ken Peplowski,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I bought the new Paperwhite because my old one is losing its battery power. The new one will not download my newspaper subscriptions even after I cancelled and re-renewed said subscriptions. The 4G doesn't kick in when it's supposed to; and the book covers don't download for display; and the system froze a few times when I tried to download my previously purchased books. I called customer service and was asked to do all the obvious things I'd already tried, so I did all of them again so they would believe me when I said it wasn't working properly. I rebooted, turned the wireless on and off, etc. etc. They then suggested I leave it off for an hour and they'd call back. They didn't, and this device is going straight into the garbage along with the hours I gave up of my life in trying to get it to work properly."
Grace,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had my kindle paper white for a few months now.
Pros:
Sleek design
Lightweight
Easy to read in just about any light
Plenty of room to store books
Absolutely great when traveling; you can take along hundred of books in this sleek, compact reader.

There are cons (meaning “annoyances”) but I like the Kindle Paperwhite in spite of these annoyances.

Cons:
Finding the books you want to read on your kindle is clunky. That is, you can sort into categories or by title or author or alphabetically, etc. (a very nice feature). But when you scroll through any of these set ups to find something, the pages don’t flip easily and things you do not want at the time keep opening or downloading as you are trying to scroll through to find a specific book. It is too time consuming.

I always like to know the copyright information and the publisher. You would think that would be in the opening pages of the book, but it is not. If I click on “Go To” I don’t get an option to go to copyright information. Before reading a book on my Kindle, I usually go to Amazon and look up this information. It’s quicker than trying to find it on the Kindle.

Usually the bottom of a page tells me location (something meaningless like what percent of the book I have read or some crazy number such as 4221 (???). I know this has to do with how the book is formatted, but it’s annoying. It is worth noting, however, that some e-books do give you actual pages.

The Kindle tells you things such as it will take you 4 more minutes to finish a particular chapter. That’s silly information given that there are dozens of variables related to how long it will really take. And who cares anyway?

There is something wonderful about an actual printed book where you can flip the pages back and forth, flip easily to something you want to reread, etc. if there are any illustrations and/or graphics, Kindle doesn’t always display them well. Reading on a Kindle is a different experience than reading on a printed book. The kindle is great, but it doesn’t delight the way a printed book can.

Having said all this, I would buy the Kindle Paperwhite again without question. It is great for travel, and you can also just throw it in your bag when heading out somewhere. Besides, you never find yourself saying, “I wish I had brought X zbook with me ...” because with the Kindle you have your entire library with you."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the light weight and sleek feel of this Ereader. The E-ink display is pretty cool and allows for a surprisingly long battery life. In order to maximize the battery life, just make sure you run airplane mode and turn off bluetooth unless using. As far as some people's complaints about the power button being on the bottom, just make sure you buy a nice case. You should be doing this anyways just to protect your device. The button then becomes a non-issue.

The only thing that I wish this thing could do is allow you to listen to an audible book at the same time as reading the Ebook. You can either listen to the book or read it, but you can't do both at the same time. The app has this capability for phones/tablets. Seems kind of odd that a device specifically dedicated as an Ereader doesn't support that ability.

Otherwise, I highly recommend buying one if you're looking for a high quality Ereader. The price for the full storage and no adds is a little steep, but I ended up purchasing this on prime day for $50 less than normal. At that price it was a great deal and definitely worth buying."
Grog,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Last Friday, I ordered three books from Amazon. But my Kindle would not download them, the wireless had failed. So I ordered a new Kindle Paperwhite. It works like it is supposed to, I'll give it that. The problem is, it is totally unacceptable and not even as good as my old time first Kindle. The Touch Screen and user interface will drive a monk to loose patience. Searching for my downloaded books, I had to turn pages through 40 pages. This was usually Swipe > Open Book > tap top of screen and hope correct Task bar Opens so that I can close the book > Close Book > Swipe page > Swipe Page >open book you get the picture.
To top it off, the three books that I had just ordered from Amazon, well three out of three are NOT compatible with this device.
I have just received an expensive lesson in Do NOT buy Devices without trying them first. This Kindle is not as advertised, it is garbage. I have de-registered this Kindle after one day. MY daughter doesn't want it, her friend has one and hates it. So it is going to Goodwill or the garbage. Useless and not good looking enough to function as a paper weight, it won't replace the stone I already have."
jt,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Paperwhite a while ago and have regretted it since. I honestly cannot think of one good factor about it other than it's built well. Other than that...1) too expensive for what it does, 2) ambiant display, even when set at the brightest, is too dull. 3) takes too long to start up, 4) display ""blinks out"" each time it loads another book, 5) despite the advertisement the battery life is no longer than the average Android tablet when ""internet"" connection is active. 6) cannot connect to any site other than Amazon Kindle site & even that is far too slow. 7) cannot download books from any of the hosts of other book downloading sites such as Gutenberg or specialty sites that cater to other interests. For me this would include classics in theological, philosophical or literary sites. 8) you cannot turn the dumb thing off when you are not going to be using it for a while. And, no, turning off the screen doesn't count. I mean turning it off *completely* to *really* save battery life! For what it does Amazon's own 8"" Fire tablet is a far superior choice. And at a better price. As I am on Social Security such things as the price of a purchase are very important, and this was a true waste of money for me. I regret having made this purchase and will stick, rather, to my Amazon Fire 8 HD."
Will,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This paperwhite is now ""Audible"" capable, with bluetooth earbuds/headphones. Everything else about the device is improved. The fonts are a little sharper, memory has been doubled compared to my old one and the body is noticeably thinner. Battery life is still phenomenal. I gave it 4 stars for a design issue. I wish it had buttons for page turning. If you nod off while reading and your finger touches the screen for a bit it can take a while to find your place later."
Wm. Scott Conway,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, here the lists...

What I like...

1. Lighter. It doesn't have the heft the other PW has.
2. Smaller. The whole frame is smaller, and it doesn't sacrifice screen-size.
3. More storage. I could have done with the 8 GB, but my beloved wife got me the 32 GB.
4. As a disclaimer, I do not yet have the dead pixel or USB cable issue others have had.
5. Waterproof. I took my older PW to Hilton Head over the summer but was always worried about getting it close to the water. Not an issue with this model. Jellyfish are still an issue though, but I digress.
6. Bluetooth and Audible integration, although this could be done just as easily with a cell-phone.

What I don't like...

1. Although it has more LED's, my older PW is actually noticeably brighter when they are both set to the same light level (See photo... light set to 12 on both devices... older PW is on the left... the new one is on the right).
2. A little slow touch response, compared to the old PW. And you have to mean it. No soft tapping, but almost like pushing a button. Makes swiping a pain, because half the time it registers as a touch and you end up opening a book or collection when you wanted to swipe to the next page.
3. Battery life... Non-existent... I haven't had time to measure how well the battery is during normal reading, but while I was downloading all my books and setting it up, it killed the battery 3 times in a day. Of course, downloading hundreds of books within a 24 hour period is unusual power drain, and will only need to be done once during initial setup. But still. Maybe Amazon will incorporate something into a software update that manages power consumption better.

Unless you have Audible books, or have so many books that 4 GB is not enough, then moving to this reader is fairly lateral. I don't use Audible, so that is just a thing for me now. But that may change in the future.

If this is your first Kindle, it is still a great device. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it.

UPDATE: The battery, on standby mode, will barely show any discharge in the course of a week if the device isn't even picked up."
Rebecca Housley,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Battery life? I am so disappointed in the battery life on this thing. I have owned Kindles since the first $300 keyboard model. My paperwhite from 2012 was still working fine, but I traded it in for this unit and so far, I am sorry that I did that. Luckily I still have my Voyage which I love dearly. But this model has miserable battery life. I'm going to try airplane mode and see if that helps. I've also had ""Application errors"" already. And it's noticeably slower than my Voyage.

So far, so not good. Will update with further thoughts over the Christmas season, as I use it as my daily reader.

Edit: Same day I wrote this, literally ten minutes later: I got a call from Kindle support to help with these issues. I love that so much."
Victor,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It is impossible to find how to activate the replacement warranty for a faulty paperwhite on their website. To do this call: 1 (888) 280-4331

My 10th generation paperwhite still under the warranty period started continually freezing, and tried to implement the 1 year repair or placement warranty stated in their warranty information On their website, it is impossible to find a way to implement the warranty, so I contacted them. I just got a run around about how the 30 day return period was over. Finally, reminding them that there was a 1 year warranty, I was told I could get a refund and would have to buy a new one. Unfortunately, I bought the item from Amazon at a $45 discount sale price, so I would have to pay an additional $45 if I purchased a new one.

The new paperwhite is waterproof but has bugs. It crashes and restarts more often than my old paperwhite. The problem when it crashes, is that you lose your place in the book your reading and all your bookmarks. You have to create bookmarks and exit the book often when this happens to save the bookmarks in the ""Your Clipplngs"" file, so you can recover you page location. You also have to delete ""Your Clipplngs"" between books if you don't want the kndle to take forever to exit the book and save bookmarks. Also, when you create new bookmarks, the kindle will sometimes fill up your bookmarks list with unwanted bookmarks between the one you are creating and the last one you saved."
Alina Uzhvieva,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought Kindle Touch several years ago, but for some reason I always preferred to read on my tablet instead or buy paper books. Touch screen was slow, it was impossible to read in dark rooms (i had to buy a clip with light, which was very inconvenient), software was sometimes very confusing. But then I decided to give it a second chance and upgrade to Kindle Paperwhite. Now I use it all the time, and I take it with me everywhere. It’s so light and beautiful and soft to touch. I love the new touch screen with better contrast, and the build-in light is very convenient- no more flashlight clips and other useless accessories! Upgraded software is very simple and intuitive too, I didn’t have any issues yet. Very good job made by Amazon to improve its product! And I’m especially happy that they offer a trade-in program and many discounts on Kindle during the year, so I just waited for the best moment and got my device for almost half price!
My one and only concern is the Power button. I hate that it didn’t move anywhere from the bottom of the device since Kindle Touch 2012. I usually hold Kindle vertically while reading, and sometimes I put the bottom edge on the table for support. At this moment Kindle usually turns off, because Power button is pressed against the table surface. This is soooo annoying! I’m sure I’ll find some workaround but I wish I didn’t have to."
C. Goldsberry,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was super excited that the new Kindle was on sale. My son's really old Kindle stopped working so I thought I would get myself the new one and give him my old one. After just a few days I'm trading him back. If you read in the dark at all you will not appreciate the new back lighting. The first night I tried to turn it all the way down and thought the screen malfunctioned bc it was gone. Nope. Turns out if you turn it all the way down it completely turns the light off so you are forced to keep it at the ""1"" setting which is way too bright for me in bed. Another thing I wasn't a fan of in the change was that the entire kindle is now smooth. There used to be a slight lip to the edges, but this was something that was just ""different"" for me and I could get used to. Wasn't a deal breaker like the light situation is. So bummed. Pics are for reference. The first pic shows both the old paperwhite and my new one set to ""1"" on the backlight. See the difference? Also the 2nd pic tried to show the beveled edge of the old."
JJones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a long-time user (and fan) of the Kindle. I replaced my 5-year old one with this new one. The reading experience is still great and it still has the best glare-free screen available. I got it with the advertisements on the lock screen and find it not at all annoying.

One unpleasant surprise is that, for the first time, the 3G capability cost an additional $100!!! (Verizon is my carrier.) Needless to say, I opted out this time and will try to get by on Wi-Fi. Not sure what happened with that. Annoyingly, that only became evident at checkout.

Of note, while it is billed as “waterproof”, the introductory information goes into great detail on how that is not exactly true. For practical purposes, better to think of it as water-resistant."
Melissa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical about joining the world of e-readers, but with dwindling space on my book shelves and a desire to travel with more than one book without overstuffing my pack I finally gave in. I regret nothing.

It's important to remember this is not a tablet for browsing the web or playing games. The digital ink technology is great for reading, and that's about it. I love that I can read on this screen with no backlight so that I'm not disrupting my sleep by reading before bed, but loading web pages to browse the Kindle store is a bit cumbersome. This isn't a complaint exactly, but if you want to be online you should get something more like the Kindle Fire."
Kat from MI,4.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE:
Since I originally gave this Kindle a 2-star review, I received a call from Amazon Customer Service to help me solve my issues. I was told when I bought it I could not get the version without the Adverts and it wasn't available to order on amazon.com, but Customer Service CAN and WILL give you the upgrade to removed the Adverts if you ask, and that is a huge improvement in using the device. Now when I either open my magnetic case or tap the button on the bottom, it comes on immediately right where I left off. This also removed the adverts on the home screen and replaced them with the pen & ink drawings of book-related pictures.

My Customer Service Rep also walked me through placing my device in ""airplane"" mode to save the battery, which is a different process from my old Kindles. This has given me a very big improvement in performance, as it been more than a week and I am at more than 50% power left. So about 2-3 weeks on a charge when I am reading for 3-4 hours per day.

As far as accidentally hitting the button on the bottom, I am getting better at knowing where it is and not hitting it at much in the magnetic case (problem completely eliminated with the padded aftermarket case) and even when I do hit it, tapping the button makes it come back immediately without even waiting a second.

So, I am willing to admit most of my issues were USER ERROR and I love my new Kindle now.

EARLY REVIEW:
I love Amazon and I absolutely love my old Kindles (plural). I bought the first generation with the slide switch and a case that held my IttyBitty Book Light. It was great. After several years of reading, it was starting to reboot itself every few weeks and I thought perhaps the end was getting near. So I bought the PaperWhite and was in love all over again. I took it everywhere; hotels, doctor appointments, camping, any vacation, etc. After a few years, it starting rebooting itself and I thought this would be a good opportunity to get the waterproof PaperWhite since we camp quite a bit now.

KEEP YOUR OLD KINDLE!!

My old PaperWhite turned on by tapping the button at the bottom and within one to two seconds, it opened to wherever I left off. The new one requires me to tap the button, wait several seconds to be sure I have more than enough time to view the ads a few times, and then I have to swipe to open. I can’t look away or I might miss the swipe and have to start over.
The option to buy one without the adverts was NOT AVAILBLE, and paying to upgrade will not improve the experience, per the sales people at the Kiosks in my area.
The old PaperWhite had pen and ink line drawings of various book related vignettes, giving it an old, book like comfort. The new one has advertising - not really a big deal, but I am bombarded with ads to the point I find them aggravating.
The old PaperWhite My Library showed my books - the new one show ads and a couple of my books. Searching the Kindle Store is equally obnoxious on the new PaperWhite.

The new recommended case for the new PaperWhite is very thin and hard. It does not take up a lot of space, is light weight, has a magnetic on when opened (to the adverts) but I still have to swipe to see my book. It is also so small that if I rest the Kindle on my lap or anywhere, it pushes the button on the bottom to turn it off - and I don’t have an opportunity to cancel the action, such as needing to swipe it off, it just goes off. And then I have to go through the 2 step and several second process of turning it back on. This new case is also fairly uncomfortable to hold so after several times of accidentally turning the Kindle off when I wanted to just turn the page, I replaced it with an aftermarket case that is softer and more comfortable to handle and protects the bottom button from accidental activation.

The old PaperWhite came with a charging cord that I could plug into any outlet, or remove the plug and use the USB to charge from my computer. The new one came with the cord and USB but I had to pay extra for the plug. I was told it was because Amazon does not know for sure what type of plug I would want, so it is now separate. I am using Amazon in the US, I live in the US and I pay in US dollars. What plug to you think I might want?

Both of my older Kindles needed to be recharged every 2-3 weeks. The new PaperWhite is every 3 days. I cannot take this camping as there is frequently no electricity available.

Seriously, go with the older PaperWhite WITHOUT adverts. I am considering returning this one and getting another older one. I still love the Kindle reading experience, but I am very unhappy with the new one."
E.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a Kindle in the past and eventually used it less and less as technology moved way beyond it. I ended up reading most of my books on my cell phone. I decided now to give another chance to the new Kindle paperwhite (mainly because of the addition of the backlight). After using it for a few months I am quite dissappointed that it's whispersync is truly unreliable. I normally leave the Kindle at home and I would pick up from where I left the reading on my cell during the day. I usually just try several times to sync and then just perform a reset (which eventually fixes the issue). It is intolerable in the age of 5G and products like the snappy Fire stick TV, we have a reader that can't sync to the furthest page read. Such a missed opportunity for the Kindle team."
Linda M,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has been making me special offers to trade in my not-that-old Kindle Paperwhite for a new waterproof one with more storage. I finally succumbed, lured by the promise of 25% off plus a generous trade-in allowance and the rationalization that I needed a new case and would like a version without the annoying special offers. I filled out the trade-in paperwork and was granted an instant $50 credit that would be finalized after they received my trade-in. My Kindle had been in a hard shell case since purchase; the screen was perfect, there was nothing wrong with it and it was just as Amazon sold it to me (and described in their offer) Nevertheless, when they received it, they told me it was worth only $5, and since I had checked the wrong box on the offer, they could not return it to me. I was furious, and felt misled and abused. But instead of having a futile conversation on the phone, decided I would just post a review instead and warn others to beware of unconditionally accepting a trade-in offer from Amazon. I am a business writer; Amazon's first stated corporate principle is customer obsession; pretty sure this principle was not used in my case. I have been a great customer for years; have more than 500 books in my Kindle library and I am an Amazon Prime member, and buy and ship stuff all the time. I will now be reevaluating all my choices, I am so disappointed in them. It's not the $50, it's the deceptive nature of the practice. They knew everything about my Kindle since I'd bought it from them; to offer me $50 and then give me $5 is totally unacceptable and truly shook my faith in what I had regarded as a great company. Hope the $45 was worth it to them. On a practical note, I had several issues many Kindle users may be familiar with - my library did not transfer over; the only way I could do it was to select books I wanted to download and then download them. They do not show whether you have read them or not in your online library, so had to transfer all of them, and now will have to sort through. They also gave me a new send to Kindle email that took a while for me to figure out and change back. Kindle is a great technology; too bad the company has decided to behave like a used car dealer."
Bridget Jones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the original kindle fire and I love the idea of reading on a kindle instead of my iphone. I do like the lightness of kindle paperwhite however that does not make up for all the other problems. The screen resolution is horrible, reading anything felt like reading something that's faded with time... overall I'm just not happy with it. I will be returning it."
Erica,4.0 out of 5 stars,"You know I’d give this 5 stars but there’s a few problems (why’d you have to do us like this amazon?!? I was soooo excited and ready for this!) for one the battery being quicker to drain out is not a myth it’s *the truth*. I expected maybe, maybe my hopes of it being talked about weren’t all that true. But it’s the real major problem here, for me at least.

I love the slimness of the new kindle, it’s sleek, no sunken in part that distracts from the edges to face. Perfect.

I wish they had darkened the colors of the text, but not a big deal!

Brightness will really kill your battery, and so will WiFi. But despite turning it down and off with the WiFi the battery drains. Even if it’s not in use. I can’t understand that because how flawless it was to me before.

WATER RESISTANCE! That’s my key, I couldn’t make this a 2 or 3 star with this additive. It isn’t a big one- it’s a major one. And my last kindle (bless it) made its finale dropping in my bathtub last year. I wasn’t going to update it if this hadn’t Happened but I kind of believed it was eventually going to happen since I like to relax in the bath and read. (Why didn’t I just bring my paperbacks?)

Anyhow hoping that next time (because we waited so lonnnnng this time for an update) there will be corrections to the battery life."
Justin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to the latest 10th-Gen Paperwhite after owning a 5th Generation Basic Kindle for a few years. On the old Kindle, I would constantly tire of having to use a reading light and a waterproof case that never really worked. The Paperwhite solves these problems immediately. The backlight is perfect when I adjust it to the appropriate level. I love the water-resistant feature as I love reading in the pool. I never fully submerge my Kindle, but having the extra protection makes it less of a “chore” to take it in the water.

Pros
- Very nice, high-quality screen. Higher quality and crisper text than Kindle 5th Generation.
- Compact, flush-screen design. (The screen is not “sunken in” to the device)
- Backlight
- Lightweight
- More than enough storage (8GB - who is every going to load 10,000 ebooks to this thing???)

Cons
- When waking from sleep, it takes a moment. I’ve timed it ranging from 1 second to 3 seconds. The screen reads “waking-up” to let you know that it is waking from sleep. Not sure what is taking up this time.

- No ambient light sensor to adjust backlight based on the room. In direct sunlight, you don’t need the backlight. In a perfectly dark room, you don’t need a blindingly-high backlight. Having to manually adjust the backlight for every room/situation you enter is surely wasting battery life because I always forget to adjust the backlight when I don’t need it. When I need it in the dark (reading in bed), chances are it is set so high that it will wake me or others up. I wish there was a gentle “fade in” effect to the backlight or an ambient light sensor. They have been in phones now for 10+ years so I can’t imagine the tech is that expensive.

- Only audible audiobooks can be loaded onto the Kindle. I would use Bluetooth if I was able to load other audiobooks (from my library) onto the device.

Neutral
- I do not listen to Audible, so I do not use Bluetooth. I leave it off. I think this gives me better battery life. Some have complained in the reviews about battery life when Bluetooth is left on. Can’t comment on Bluetooth because the audiobooks I rent from the library can’t be loaded on here.

- Home screen view with “sponsored” ads, etc. When you lock the device, an ad shows for some books you can buy on Amazon. They are not bothersome, but rarely have I found anything worth merit. Also, I turn off the “advanced” home screen view because I just want to view a grid of my books on the device - that’s it. I wish this was the default, but I get why it’s not. Amazon has to push recommendations to drive sales.

You can get the basic home screen view by going to All Settings > Device Options > Advanced Settings > Home & Library > and turn “off” Home Screen View."
Joel A. Price,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this newest Paperwhite version and replaced my 2015 version. This one is nice and I love the bigger memory, bluetooth feature and Audible support. Great, and log overdue features. It is slightly slimmer than the prior versions. Instead of a sunken screen, it is one uniformly flat face, which included the screen. There is a design flaw, IMO, in that it is not 100% flat. The corners of the reading screen have a slight dip, which causes a non-removable bubble in any screen protector you may add. I have tried two and they both have bubbles in the same places. These do not interfere with the readability of the actual body of the text, however, it is annoying to see every time I look at the screen and annoying that it is not possible to have a protector for this without bubbles, which have nothing to do with how the protector is applied, but the cause is the design of the kindle. The prior versions, having a sunken screen, was better in that being sunken was automatically a screen protection. Also, I did have a protector on it, and it was basically bubble free as no corner issues existed. I do not think this is a defective unit, but simply how these are built as the device works great and I do very much like it... But...GRRR...couldn't this have been discovered and fixed in quality control before selling these new kindles? I docked 2 stars for this flaw, otherwise, it would be a 5 star review."
David S,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used Kindle's since the original Kindle was released. I have never bought a new one as soon as a new one is released. This is the first Paperwhite I have owned. I also use the Kindle App on my iPad a LOT.

I have started using this as my Primary reading device now. The battery life is way better than my iPad. I will never expect the battery life to last for a week. I read each and every day. The backlight chews up battery life, it always will. To me that's not bad it just the way it is. Apple has done a remarkable job giving the iPad an 8-10 battery life. The retina display and the color really eats up the battery. I'm saying that to say, I have very real expectations about battery life. This Kindle fits within those parameters for me.

I also own a Fire but I like my iPad better. To me the Paperwhite Kindle fits the bill for what I like in an e-Reader. My only beef is that it runs slow. Most of the time when I'm trying to page through my books (looking for one in particular) it will Open one instead of moving to the next page. It treats the swipe like I tapped to open a book. I don't like that. It would be better if there were buttons on the side to do the paging thus eliminating this issue.

All in all it's a good device even though it's slow."
Pen Name,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this as a gift. The light you can adjust, but it reminds me of an LED light. I'm very shocked that it does not bother my eyes like a phone screen does. I'm still getting used to it. Trying to go backwards a page or two if I accidentally move forward too far is not as easy for me. It seems that swiping back works best. But it's only happened a couple of times and I tend not to mess with it. The one thing I don't like, and I'm not sure if it's just this or if it's with all kindles, you have to download your books. I had a previous kindle that was dying, and that could be the cause. Which is cool on the one hand, but annoying on the other. I haven't been able to figure out how to turn off the wifi to extend the battery life. But otherwise I do really enjoy it. It is super light, and the cover I received with it is cool since it puts the kindle to sleep and I just have to swipe to wake it up. No idea if it's because of the specific cover I received or not. But I do enjoy it. Plus you get to personalize it. You can choose the font time from like 5 or so but still, pretty cool."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third and likely my last Kindle. I was an early adopter of the original Kindle and was head over heels in love with the product. My first kindle lasted about 2-3( maybe slightly more) years. I then replaced it with the Kindle Oasis which I really liked too. That is until the battery gave out after about a year. I purchased this Kindle Paperwhite in mid-November 2018. It has gone completely dead as of this week, during an overseas trip, of course. The quality of the Kindle products and Amazon brand products, in general, has completely tanked. As an aside, I've had similar problems with the Fire TV as well. I'll stick with my iPhone and iPad to read my Kindle titles, of which I have many, from now on."
Richard Schulze,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Dont get me wrong, I like this device just fine. But there are some things I think they really failed with. The biggest issue being the non adjustable light. I have read that previous models had an adjustment and that they took the option away probably to influence people to spend more on the oasis. (Maybe. Maybe not.) Either way I find it annoying that I'm stuck with one setting. The touch screen is a bit slow. The battery life is ok, but I expected a little better ( I reckon it would be a lot better if I could adjust the light) over all I do enjoy reading on it and for the price I paid for it on prime day I'm satisfied."
Tttommie45,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Update. After chatting with support because the battery was only lasting three days, they sent me a new paperwhite. I got the new one, charged it and after 2 days, the battery was about 25%. I started googling the issue and found the battery lasted 6 weeks, IF YOU SET BRIGHTNESS VERY LOW, TURNED OFF BLUETOOTH AND WIFI AND ONLY USED IT FOR 30 MINUTES A DAY.

Basically it lasts 6 weeks if you don't use it. I told the support last week that I had the brightness set at 20, wifi turned on and used it 3 to 4 hours daily. So I got a new one not because the old one was bad but because the support didn't know what he was talking about.

I guess I'll have to live with 3 or 4 day battery life.

Pros: I really like the light weight. I bought this because of tendinitis in both thumbs and the lightness helps a lot.

Cons: Unless i just haven't found it yet, the Kindle app on my Samsung tablet has more features.
THE BIG ONE. The advertisements say that the battery lasts for weeks. I don't know how they figure that unless they don't turn it on for weeks. THE BATTERY LASTED A TOTAL OF THREE DAYS. It was down to 71% after the first day. I don't know if it would save much if I turned off the WiFi or not. I don't have the screen brightness abnormally high. If there is a way to make the battery last for weeks, I would sure like to now what it is."
CONNIEF,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Kindle had a keyboard, and a replaceable battery. Absolutely loved it; then accidentally broke it. Second Kindle was not quite as likable, but managed okay until it suddenly stopped working. Now I'm on my third Kindle. The lighting issue is fine, but the print size is not as usable, and page turning is erratic. Sometimes it takes several taps to turn, and other times it it may jump several pages, either back or forward, and takes searching to find my last page. Sure wish I had my old keyboard Kindle back again. It had the convenient page-turning button."
Mike,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First of, I have loved my Kindles..like weirdly love as if they arent even a cold slab of tech but something that is personal. They have gotten me through daily commutes, waiting in the Dr's and DMV office, lunchtime breaks and many good hours in the summer spent in the hammock just me and my dog and my Kindle...yes, I am a part of this cold corporate entity's cult..I realize it, and like the crazy people you see being dragged from the jungle by their family from some third rate cult leader...I have no regrets.

So... I had a Kindle Voyage and was happy with that until the screen froze and nothing I would do could unfreeze it or shut the Kindle down. Now I had it three years but for a ""premium"" device that is not long...but complaints about that are for another time (note to Amazon, my 6 year old Ipad Mini is going strong after being dropped etc.) I traded in my Voyage for this new version of the Paperwhite and I have to say, this is as good as my ""higher end"" Voyage. Sure it doesn't have the ""etched"" glass pager turn buttons and as many lights but I do not miss those at all..(I don't really like my Kindle that bright...) and could care less about the page turn buttons, I never used them anyway. This Kindle has a sharp screen and all the lighting you need and while it doesn't have a tapered back like my last one, really, these things are just made for reading, that is all I need it for and that is exactly what it does. The only thing I wish that it could do was to allow different shades of color to turn the screen, say make the page a more, parchment like brown, (again, like my Ipad does..) or vary the shade of white.

Other then that,and Amazon wont like this, save your money from the Oasis (now that they discontinued the Voyage I was thinking of switching to that one) the Paperwhite quietly does what it is supposed to do, with a great screen and all the light you could need in any situation. End of story."
R. Custer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a Kindle fire since they came out. I barely use it. The glare from the screen and fonts never did it for me. I was always envying family members Paperwhites. When this came out (small enough to fit in my jeans pocket) and waterproof, wow. I can sit in the hot tub and read. Mind you there are a slew of conditions on the waterproof. It needs to be fresh water and not pool water. If it gets in the port you have to wash is out with fresh water, stand it vertically, and let it dry. I will probably do a final 90% isopropyl alcohol rince for better drying. I can get a micro USB dust/ moisture plug for $0.42. That should protect it from splash. Since it holds a charge for weeks it is not much of a nuisance to be able to read in the tub. The back light is a great feature. I keep it very low. The screen size is about like a paperback book print area. The touch screen makes a great user interface. A good deal of the memory was used up by the programming. Still I loaded 20 books, 5 dictionaries, and a religious library of several thousand pages and still have 5.7 gigabites left. Most books take less than a minute to download. So even if I fill the RAM I can keep a huge library in the cloud."
SP,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The accessibility feature, VoiceView has a lot to improve! Actually the Text-to-Speech feature on the older Kindle Keyboard reader is, in my opinion, a MUCH better option!! In comparison… VoiceView - clicks each time a page is turned, Kindle Keyboard does not; VoiceView - the first word of the next page is read VERY LOW and there is a pause, Kindle Keyboard seamlessly goes from page to page same volume, same speed, no pause; VoiceView - there is NO option to change to a different voice, Kindle Keyboard can be changed either male or female. VoiceView - during the reading there is no pause button, Kindle Keyboard - can pause during reading in case it is needed. Overall comparing the two, again in my opinion, Amazon needs to go back to the original Text-to-Speech, or at the very least offer the two options."
SMO,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave this a five star rating because the product is as advertised. Just not certain that it's for me.

I had an old Kindle keyboard that finally gave out so I replaced it with a $30 sale price Kindle Fire. I read a lot of history and biography and liked that photographs were rendered in crisp, clear color. Also liked that I could set the background to sepia, which lessened eyestrain. I'm a heavy reader and go through 3-4 books per week so battery life became an issue and decided to get a Paperwhite to read from while charging the Kindle Fire.

My first issue when I received the Paperwhite was the rubbery backing as I have a latex allergy. Sent a tweet to Amazon asking if any latex was used in the backing and was surprised to get an answer within 10 minutes that the backing is latex-free. Perhaps this should be noted somewhere on the description as this isn't an uncommon allergy but good on Amazon to give me such a fast answer.

The Paperwhite itself is okay. Can't adjust the background color, which I'd expected. The smaller screen size, though, has me turning pages much faster than on the 7"" Kindle Fire which gets a little tiresome as I'm a fast reader. So far I'm happy with the battery life, though, which was my main purpose in buying it. The compact size is handy to toss in a handbag if I'm traveling so that's also a positive. In the end, though, I don't think this will be my primary reader."
Kaila,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This one is nice over all, lighter than my standard kindle, and I have a large library, so great on the space.

I do not like the blue tone to the backlight, and I'm not sure who made such a bizarre decision given that one of several big reasons people use e-readers instead of tablets is to avoid blue light. Even if it's not the tone that various studies have warned against over the last several years, it's definitely a....lighting that makes me headachey. Which makes it useless for me for reading in bed without an external source of light. Seeing as that was one of the reasons I chose this kindle, that is the reason for the docked star.

About battery life, which has received several complaints from people ""who have owned kindles since the beginning"". I'm going to assume that in the past they don't remember the first couple days owning their earlier models, or in the time between the latest models they must've hugely expanded their library. Because the battery drain is normal the first several days if you have a large library. It's not a malfunction. After downloading, even ""asleep"", it's indexing all of those volumes you've just downloaded. Hence a very swift battery drain. It won't do that if your library is tiny, or if you don't download a bunch of books at a time. But if your library is large, it will. All kindles will. For that matter, though it's been many years since I've owned an e-reader from the other major competitor, I believe theirs did the same. It isn't a product flaw.

I have to agree with others that the power button on the bottom is a bad design feature, especially off-center. Where it's at now, if you have it in a stand, it's either inaccessible or else a support ends up against it, powering it off or restarting it as soon as you set it in the holder. Not going to dock a star for that though since it's fine if it's in most cases.

Water-proofing serves me well. Extra storage, definitely serves me well."
Stitcher,1.0 out of 5 stars,"""A single charge last weeks not hours"" is the statement in the description of this paperwhite. Is this statement for someone who reads less than a hour a day? I've had it less than a week and have had to charge it 2 times already. Yes, I read a lot but the charging issue is a pain. Charge lasts less than any previous kindle I've had. Have no clue if I'm doing something wrong...have it on airplane mode (so it doesn't lose more life) and brightness is a bit high probably for it but still having to charge it every couple of days is so not what I expected.

UPDATED:
Still 1 star. Spoke with 2 different Amazon representatives with an average phone call of 30 minutes. Rebooted, reset and restarted. Ended up getting another one on 23 May (sent the first one back) after one week with the first one. Made sure it was fully charged again. Kept track of percentage of charge all day today (24 May). At 9 a.m. was 100%. By 7 p.m. it's down to 61%. Just think this one needs to go back to the drawing board for a better product. I've had 5 Kindles over the years and never disappointed until this one. Guess there is nothing else to do except keep charging it. I want to be able to read without a charging cord all the time."
rick,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally made the leap from my early gen Kindle that I've used for almost 10 years to the new Paperwhite. The biggest problem with the older version was the lack of an integrated light. However, the clarity and brightness of my new Paperwhite makes me wonder why I waited so long. Plus, being smaller and lighter makes it even more comfortable to hold. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5, is because I'm still adjusting to the touch screen, vs the hard buttons on both sides of the bezel on the old one. The buttons made going forward and back with either hand very convenient. I will update my rating after I use the PW for awhile longer."
fro,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle is a great product, and compared to a standard tablet, any Kindle is a superior product for reading. However, Kindles are supposed to maintain the illusion of a book-like reading experience, and that's where the new Paperwhite model falls short.

First of all, the new Paperwhite has the shortest battery life of any other e-book model that I've tried. It still lasts several days on a single charge, but Kindle users have become accustomed to reading for several WEEKS on a single charge.
Second, this is the first model that requires ""waking up"" before reading. Any other Kindle, you open the cover and there's your book, waiting for you. When you open the new paperwhite model, or turn it on with the power button, you might find yourself waiting 3-5 seconds for your book to open. This may seem insignificant, but it seriously impacts the book-reading experience of most users.

Perhaps the waterproof cover is enough to compensate for these problems. All of the other features perform as expected. But if you have a Kindle Voyage, I'd recommend sticking with that for now.

EDIT: After leaving this review, Amazon sent me an e-mail, offering to try to resolve my problems with my Kindle. The reply-to e-mail address was non-functional. Amazon, you suck at your job."
querkan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the new paperwhite because my older model was starting to act a little buggy (light unevenly distributed on screen, and thinking a little too much when I added or deleted content). I'm happy that the newer model runs smoother and is water resistant. The battery life seems the same (I always keep mine on airplane mode unless I'm downloading something, and the more responsive touch screen makes it faster to switch modes). Honestly, the kindle loses a whole star because of how overly responsive the power button is. This is not a problem I had with older kindles. With this kindle paperwhite, if I try to use it on an exercise machine, it's going to turn itself off at least once. Sometimes it even goes through a restart cycle. When I take it out of my purse, I frequently find that it has turned itself on. If I lean it against something -- without being extreeemely careful -- the power button WILL activate. A cover would probably solve the issue, but I hate the idea of carrying something that makes the e-reader bulkier and heavier. I hope the next generations of the kindle have a much stiffer on/off button."
CRTreeGuy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because my old Kindle Touch finally quit working (the touchscreen) after at many years, so I couldn't navigate any more. The feature that this new one has that the old one did not was the backlight which I really love. I can now read anytime anywhere without depending on external light, which usually glared on the screen. The thing I don't like about this one is that when I turn this one on I have to wait about 5 seconds while it wakes up, and then after inputting my code it stays on the advertising screen which I then have to swipe to get to my book. The old Kindle went straight to the code, and then straight to my book with no lag time at all. Also the battery life on the old Kindle was much much better, I used to just charge it two or three times a year. This one I've had to recharge 3 times already and I've only had it a couple months. I guess it is what I pay for the backlight, so it is worth it. The screen on the new one is easier on the eyes to read which is nice. Not sure if I'll ever use the waterproof feature, but I guess it is nice to have just in case."
Nevah Mind,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've made a conscience decision to read more based on the influence of my Son. I have been reading paperbacks but I purchased a Kindle Fire 7 ( using to do this review) and decided to give e-reading a chance so I subscribed to a free trial of Kindle Unlimited and been reading off of my Kindle Fire 7 and within a day I knew this is my preferred method of reading. After coming to this conclusion I decided to purchase a Kindle Paperwhite for both me and my Son and I feel it is one of the best purchases I've made recently. It frees up my Fire which in turn uses less battery. I feel like reading off the Paperwhite is a much more pleasant experience than the Fire maybe due to the technology used. It's much more compact and weighs less also. I can't comment on battery life because I've only had it for one day but from all of the research I did I'm sure it'll only need to be charged once a week or so. If you're trying to read more and want thousands of books in a compact device I say give the Paperwhite a chance.
David L. Hankin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Paperwhite is a fine product that is almost as solid as my previous Kindle device. Did I want to buy a new Kindle? Emphatically, no. I was using a relatively new Kindle Voyage (a few years old). Of the several Kindle devices I have owned, it was far and away the best - I treated it with kid gloves. Then the 2019 switch to daylight savings time was upon us and that evening, long after I retired for the night, my Kindle Voyage froze on some nefarious software update screen that I neither asked for nor authorized. After hours with very poor technical support, I was advised by Amazon that since my device was out of warranty, my only option was to purchase a new Kindle. I suspect that they thought I might upgrade to an overpriced Oasis. I did not fall for it - the Paperwhite is pretty solid although I preferred the page advancement features of the Voyage and its battery life was noticeably superior. The net net of my tale is that I give Amazon 4 stars for the new Kindle (if it had the page advancement features of the Voyage, I would have given it 5 stars) but I give Amazon customer/technical service zero stars as this was a highly disappointing experience - technical support was incompetent - if the answer to a problem was not in the standard protocol, the support people were clueless. If Amazon, which is approach monopoly status, is unwilling to stand behind their products, watch out for the anti-trust police."
TK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had a 4 year old kindle and enjoyed it for some time. I decided to trade in my old one and get a kindle paperwhite (appreciated the credit for my trade in). I wanted to upgrade to a paperwhite because I got tired of having to be close to a light source to read at night. I like reading in my bed at night and therefore don't want the room lit up like Christmas. So far I have been impressed and it does its job well.
Pros
- Back light helps keep one reading anywhere
- Back light can be turned down to give it a more ""classic"" kindle screen and less computer looking screen
- longer lasting battery life than previous kindle (although time will tell how this battery will keep a long charge)
- Can take a beating (water resistant which makes me more willing to let my kids grab it) through drops and water splashes. I haven't' tried using it in the tub (who's got time to do that) but they advertise you can.
Cons
- The font settings take a tiny bit longer to get too than my previous kindle (but not a huge deal)
- Takes a bit longer to wake up than my last kindle

Overall these are great to have with you on trips, DMV's, or other places you need to kill time or simple want to enjoy a plenthra of reading choices."
Kindle Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a large library in my Amazon cloud account. If you have more than a couple of hundred books this is not your solution.
You are supposed to be able to wirelessly download your library to your new device. It wouldn't work for me.
You are supposed to be able to transfer books previously purchased from your computer to your device. My device kept disconnecting itself from the computer.
I was left with the option to manually download each book individually by touching the screen to trigger download. This was complicated by sensitive touch screen which kept opening downloaded books when I wanted to swipe to a new page to download more books. NOT acceptable!
My suggestion, buy an 8"" Kindle Fire tablet and a large SD card and use this as your book reader. (BTW, the price of the largest internal memory 8"" tablet and a large SD card is actually cheaper than the latest price on the Paperwhite; as of March 2020)"
David Huwiler,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my first Paperwhite in 2013 and loved it. I used it almost every day, never had an issue, and wish I had kept it. (I gave it away when I ordered the newest version).

Perhaps my expectations were unrealistic, but I am a little disappointed with the new model. The biggest issue is the ""wake up"" time. My earlier Paperwhite came on instantly. This one has a long ""waking up"" period each time the cover is opened. That issue alone, had I been aware of it, would have kept me from springing for the new model, but there are two other issues:

My old Kindle never crasned. Not once in five years. This one crashed twice the first week. Finally, the cable connection is different and finnicky. for reasons I don't understand, it is very difficult to connect the charging cable to the new model.

Bottom line: if you have an older Paperwhile, my advice would be to hang on to it unless the waterproofing is a big deal for you or you need more memory. I see no difference at all in the screen quality, build quality, or features."
Michel J. Gaudet,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing brags about how you can get ""... UP TO TWO WEEKS OF BATTERY..."" The battery life you can expect is less than 24 hours, IF you read a lot. However, if you read maybe a chapter with the back-light set to ZERO, which means using the thing either during the day, or with a nice light source at night, then MAYBE you get a weeks worth of battery. This CRAP about TWO WEEKS must be if you fully charge, turn off the screen, and then pick it up two weeks later to use the thing; all I can figure.

I have a rather large library of Kindle ebooks; very close to 6000 titles, and over 350 of those are what I call 'multi-volume' books, which means anywhere from TWO and up-to TWENTY books per/title. So I actually have over 7000 downloadable items. Why do I mention this? Simple. I want ALL of my content on the device, and THAT is why I chose the 32gig version. This device takes FOREVER to download your content. The bad thing is, even though Audible has made it so we can download 200 titles at a time (and continue choosing 200+++++!), you only get about six titles downloaded, then there is this LONG pause, and maybe another six or so in a little while... up to fifteen mins. or so.

The previous Paperwhite I bought a few years back was MUCH faster with downloading, and the battery lasted a HUGE amount longer.

This device is going back for a refund- BIG waste of money for someone wanting to have a LARGE library on the thing.

EDIT!!! I originally gave this thing TWO stars, but after thinking about it, I decided that it is worth at least FOUR. WHY, you ask? Simple. For someone with a much smaller library than me, this thing is a great choice. Oh, but GET THE ONE without the 'Special Features'. Reason for the smaller price tag is the 'Special Features' always has adds at the bottom, until you start reading. THAT'S why the lower price for the 'SF' version! While the adds disappear when reading, I still find them intrusive. But if the adds don't bother you, go for the one I am reviewing here.

If you want to experience the fastest downloads, use a 'system' directly connected to the web by-way-of a cable. Plug this device into your 'system' usb. Using a computer or such that you have connected to the web by WiFi is not any faster for downloads to the device; must be a cable connection."
Pammi,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin with my 2016 Kindle Paperwhite. I am comparing it against the 2019 NEW Kindle Paperwhite waterproof. It says that the 2019 is the lightest one yet; sorry but weighs the same as my 2016, the battery life is longer yet after 3 charges and restarts the 2019 battery kept getting low. It does not start up as fast as my 2016, I think the only new things on the 2019 is more gb, smooth flat screen and they say it is waterproof. So I have sent it back. If you do not have a Kindle Paperwhite then this new one may be what you are looking for. Good luck."
RH,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I only use the Kindle when traveling overseas. I've used it approximately 18 weeks since purchase in Oct 2018. It started having an occasional fuzzy screen with heavy horizontal lines and then restarting/resetting itself and correcting the problem. Since it was beyond the 1 year warranty, Amazon didn't help beyond offering a 15% discount on a new Kindle. Repair is not possible out of warranty. No info was provided about what the problem might be. Can't recommend purchase unless you are ready to buy one every year."
shopper,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like how thin and light the new paperwhite is, and it's nice to know it's waterproof in case I wanted to take it on a boat. The screen is similar to my old one, but the border is thinner.
With the small border and very sensitive touch across most of the page, I sometimes turn the pages unintentionally. The touch area across the top for the controls, by contrast, is extremely narrow. I can bring them up, but it took some getting used to. They look similar to my last Paperwhite, but don't do work exactly the same.
Home doesn't take you to your personal library, it goes to a place you can add more books, and then to get to your own current downloaded books you have to go to the menu and choose My Library, which irritates me. I much preferred home to be my own downloaded books,
All these are little annoyances that I'm getting used to. The Paperwhite is still my favorite reading device, compared to the basic kindle, kindle fire, a phone or an ipad. If I turn off the wifi when not downloading books, the battery lasts over a week."
"Paul A. Maconi, Jr.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new Kindle! My wife and kids got it for me for my birthday. I do a lot of my reading in bed at night, so I have the display inverted (through the accessibility options). With the backlight on about 5 or 6 I have comfortable reading that doesn't disturb the Mrs. I took it out to soccer practice one evening, and I was pleasantly surprised when I was still able to read the device as the sun was going down and when the field lights finally kicked on without having to reconfigure the display. No glare or viewing angle issues to worry about. I may just leave the device inverted, but it's simple enough to switch it back and forth.

I had one of the older kindles with the actual keyboard before this one, and wow have things gotten better. If you're wondering if it's worth the upgrade, do yourself a favor and pick one up. I have the device with special offers, and I only see them on the lock screen. I know there are still people out there who worry about that, but it's completely unobtrusive. I may even check out some of the book recommendations. :)"
William Bernard,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked the old screen saver I hate the new one where I have to swipe to open it. It's smaller and does not fit in my old protective case that stood on side so I'm not a fan of the change in size. I like that it tells me the next book in a series and provides a link to download it. I would love to see an improvement or two or three that puts a small ridge along all 4 sides of the face edge that would stop my finger from inadvertently changing the page while I am reading or give me a right and left button on all 4 sides for that function. I would also like to see another improvement that allows me to rotate the viewing area in the opposite direction so that the other side of the screen is at the top of my page while in landscape view. Also a designated button to change font size and screen direction and another to connect to my local library would be great...Thank you, you have a fine product and I would recommend it to anyone that likes to read"
AmzCust,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Can not use audible on it. It does not connect to bluetooth headset, no internal speaker either. It appears like there is issue particularly with Kindle Paperwhite. Otherwise looks good so far."
Max Tinglewood,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had really high expectations from an 8th generation e-reader technology. Yet to my frustration I had discovered the hard way just how poor the PDF support is. Long story short, most PDF documents are simply unreadable on the device without going through some sort of tedious conversion. You'll be looking at a scaled down image of the page typically. Converting from PDF to mobi is still experimental at best and mostly results in broken formatting. The bulky weight I imagine is due to hefty battery side inside, making it much heavier to lug around then your average smartphone. Organizing large collection of books on the kindle is a painstaking process of pointing and clicking on each book and categorizing it.

However, despite it's drawbacks I still think it is far more convenient for reading then laptop or tablet. Books in mobile formats are absolute hoot to read on the device. The kindle email address is a nice convenience and does a pretty good job of converting pdf's to Kindle's mobi standard. Compared to all the online and software alternatives it seems lightyears ahead. I have not yet tried using the process with epubs yet, but I'll assume it's a much more straightforward conversion then PDF. The display is delightfully crisp, while having a backlight is a great addition for reading in dim light. I did consider getting the cheaper Kindle at first but can attest the backlight makes a huge difference especially in a poorly lit environment. It makes for a more sensuous reading experience in the evening, and reduces eye strain during long reading sessions."
Graham Spell,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this paperwhite for over a month now and I think I am enjoying it. I had the original Paperwhite for 6 years and absolutely love the design of it. It was the perfect texture to hold while lying on your back, side, or stomach. This one, however, has a unique texture that I sometimes feel like its slipping out of my hand. Not sure how to articulate the way it feels, but it doesn't have the same texture. Another design feature I don't like is that there is no separation from the screen to the bevel, it is completely flat like an iPad. I liked that there was some separation on the older models because I find myself accidentally pushing ""next"" or ""back"" on the screen because the screen and bevel are all just one piece. Finally, I traded in my original one because I could no longer buy books from the store without it freezing up and it was just a slower machine altogether. I thought this one would be noticeably faster, but it's really not. It's not the biggest deal, but wish it had some more speed to it. After owning it for a week I did have battery issues where the battery would deplete from 100% to dead in less than 15 minutes. But a quick call to Amazon and they helped me fix the issue. The last charge lasted me two weeks exactly with very heavy reading!

Oh yeah, the best feather compared to my original is that the screen is EVENLY LIT! This is AMAZING!

Oh yeah! If you're concerned about durability, I have dropped this on the floor a couple of times. Not issues (thankfully!)"
Jasmine T. Baer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to get a new Kindle because my last Kindle was so old, it didn’t have a backlight and was getting no usage. I was reading using the Kindle app on my iPad Mini and wanted a dedicated reader so my iPad could go back to being my video watching and web surfing device.

Pros:
- Backlight: I can read without keeping the nightstand light on.
- Size: much smaller and lighter than my ancient Kindle.
- Touchscreen: responsiveness is fine; not an iPad, but that’s fine.
- Fonts: I haven’t downloaded any additional fonts, but the included fonts are very sharp and easy to read.
- Battery Life: 2 days of use (maybe 3 hours of use, and I’m still at a >90% charge.

Cons:
I can’t think of any worth mentioning. I do miss highlighting in color (like I imagine I could have done on a Kindle Fire), but all the other pros more than outweigh my highlighting wistfulness."
Xanlthorpe,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So it has been a little over a month and the Kindle Paperwhite will not connect to my network any longer. It was connected, then all of a sudden it was not. I expected more from Amazon than 30 days of use for this digital reader. The touch response is slow and a bit clunky but it eventually gets the user to where they want to navigate but this inability to connect to the wifi has me stopped dead in the water. I have reset the device, and restarted repeatedly but still, it will not connect to the wifi.
April 4 - So I eventually discovered that the Kindle was in conflict with my wifi router. I restarted the router which deleted all existing connections and was able to reconnect the Kindle. That's a pain-in-the-butt, if this is going to be a frequent response. My iPads, iPhones, computers, lights and camera all reconnect automatically when the router restarted. The Kindle had to be connected manually. SMH."
Jada p,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved my old kind Kindle without a backlight and I lost my Kindle voyage so I was excited to see this one.

I reodered it, but waited nearly a month after it was shipped to actually open it and set it up. I unboxed the device on a Friday and the first two days were perfectly fine. By Monday, I took it out of my bag and saw that the top of the device was peeling and there were deep lines across the screen.

About twenty minutes after trying to read with it the screen darkened and the lines made the entire page unreadable. I couldn't navigate back home or into the settings because the texts on the screen we're overlapped, dark, and marked with streaks across it.
I am not sure if the ultra thinness of the product made it more susceptible to damages, but my older and more rugged Kindles never had this issue. This one is surely defective.

Update: So, immediately after posting this I was sent an email from Amazon's customer service. I gave them a call during my lunch break and they offered to ship me a new one and have me return the defective device. The device was shipped to me after two days and I am trying it out. I appreciate the customer service and rapid response, however this new one seems to be a little lighter (text and resolution is kind of faint and I'm guessing it was possibly refurbished) than the previous one.

Perhaps I am comparing it to my older Kindles subconsciously, but I am actually preferring the plain previous generation Kindle with Bo backlight over this one."
JRM,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using this paper white for several months now. I returned it once to have it adjusted/repaired. A supposedly refurbished one was returned to me which seemed to have the same problem as the first unit. My issue is two fold. First, many of the books I order do not want to download into my library. I then call and after explaining my problem to the support staff the do something on their end allowing me to receive my book. They then attempt to explain what the are doing but I am not sure what they are telling me which leads me to my second issue. I find that their English is difficult for me to understand. I know that they must understand what my problem with the Kindle is but are unable to correct me in a way I understand. One final concern is that I can download all of my books using the Kindle app on both my MacBook Air and my iPhone 7. What is not clear to me is why I can handle the task on those and not on the Kindle white paper? Well I have put the Kindle back in the box together with my frustration and stored them both in a cabinet I seldom open. Kindle is not a good word in my vocabulary unless it refers to the wood used to start a fire."
ARAD,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The new procedure of removing a book from the unit when you finish reading is inconvenient and annoying. On my old (first generation) Kindle you could simply hold down on remove and the book would go to the cloud or somewhere and you would be rid of it. Now you have to go to the Amazon website, pull up the device, pull up your library and delete it. Needlessly complicated and time consuming.
On the other side, the picture is great, love having the light, turning pages is smoother than ever. On the whole a big plus"
Tim Webster,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had thought that purchasing a kindle would be a waste of money. After all, a real book is what you must have to enter into the world that an author has created. I was proven wrong when I recently received a Kindle Paperwhite as a gift. I was able to carry an entire library on the next days business trip. I could read in any light with NO reflection...like a real book. It was convenient and comfortable to hold with easy turn pages. I am now sold on the fact that a Kindle is really worth it and a great gift to receive! I love it!"
jjflash15,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd Paperwhite and I have to say I'm disappointed. If I had it to do all over again, I would not have traded in my 1 year old Paperwhite for this one. I was lured by it being waterproof (which doesn't really mean a lot to me) and 32 Gb of memory vs my old 8 Gb. I'm not sure the extra storage will do much for me either. My biggest complaint about the new Kindle is how easy it turns itself off. I read a lot while exercising on an elliptical, treadmill, and stationary bike. I have always liked my Kindles without a cover but this one will turn itself off at the slightest bump or vibration while exercising. As a result of this defect, I broke down and bought a cover for the thing last week. So far that seems to have solved the problem but it is annoying that I had to spend another $30 to get rid of a defect designed into the unit. This Kindle also requires a much harder ""SWIPE"" to get off the power up screen to your reading page. Swipes forward and backward do not work as well either. For example, if my mind wanders while reading and I want to go back 4 or 5 screens, swiping right may go backwards but also sometimes just the oppositie occurs and it goes forward instead so that I find myself on a page I thought I had passed already. Very annoying!!!! I now find to page backward, it is more consistent to tap the far left of the screen vs my habit of swiping backward. I am probably being kind giving this Kindle 3 stars as it is vastly inferior to my last 2 Paperwhites."
Cyclist63,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered and paid for NO special offers but it came WITH them. Also, it wouldn’t pair with wireless headphones despite updating the operating system. I had to call customer service and have a new one shipped. And guess what? It still has the special offers. When I called back the IT specialist did t know how to remove them so it required a third call to finally resolve. While everything works fine now, it was really inconvenient and took multiple days to resolve everything and my wife really enjoys using it, but Very disappointed with the whole affair."
Rob,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought that I would enjoy having an e-reader when I have an iPad that I can read on, but a week ago I got a wild hair and bought one. I absolutely love it. There are very few issues I have with it. The big one is having to go deep into the settings to get to the invert option for a black screen/white text. I personally feel like that should be an option in the same settings area as the brightness control. Another thing is that it could be made slightly more intuitive in the sense that things like brightness control should be faster to get to. I know it seems like I’m ragging on my kindle, but I’ve read more books in the last week than I have in the last 2 months on my iPad. Mostly because it’s so incredibly lightweight and so much easier on the eyes while reading. I don’t ever seem to want to put it down. Bottom line: If you’re on the fence and think a tablet will do instead, I recommend taking the plunge and getting it."
Mungata,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was looking forward to a new reader and when I finally decided to go for it and received it, man nothing buy problems
Had to get help to sign on, was necessary to sign on when plugged into electric press for sec and try to sign on. Ok worked unfortunately was necessary to follow same procedure many many times when trying to use the Kindle not handy when trying to sign on ina restaurant or in the car. Tried resetting, letting it charge a full 24 hours without using,nothing really settled all the glitches. Tired for playing around with it so will return it and try some other one."
WeepWow,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a third generation for years, but the power switch stopped working, and there was a good sale . We bought the new one. Every single thing that I've accessed on my previous paper white is sitting in my library, empty. Items that I returned to my local library years ago are still floating there. I can't delete them. I had to create a separate collection to shove them, hiding them from my view. Dumb. It can be very bothersome to find new items in all the old junk.

As my kid is just started to read, I decided to use the free time system. I was able to add any item that I already had in my library when I created the account, but I cannot add from the Kindle anyting into their free time going forward. I have to login 2 either the app or web page and specifically request items to be added into the account. Apparently, the Kindle Fire had the option to add items directly from the tablet, why isn't this available here? Don't look for help on the Amazon App, as all customer support still routes to Amazon Fire free time accounts.

And for the love of Pete, don't forget your free time password as there is no option to reset. You literally have to reboot the entire system."
Francesca GAILLARD,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Except for the eInk display which is better than any phone/tablet/laptop for reading, I found it much more limited than I expected.

Pros:
- eInk display easy on the eyes and readable anywhere with or without light. (my main buying reason)
- Does offer a dark theme (white on black background) [updated]
- waterproof, I guess. Still have to use it in water-dangerous conditions though.

Cons:
- Underpowered: takes forever to do anything compared to a recent phone (my Samsung S9 for instance).
- Unable to read other formats like ePub and cannot have alternate reader apps (big pain point if you borrow from public libraries; DRM prevents converting to Kindle format)
- Experimental browser is well.... just experimental (aka unusable crap). Too bad because otherwise that could alleviate the previous point and allow reading in the browser.
- Audible: not working while reading (immersion reading) + requiring Bluetooth headphones = useless to me.
- Does offer a dark theme (white on black background) but it's buried down in settings (Accessibility) [updated]

Neutral: I'm not bothered by the ""Special Offers"". Not worth paying $20 to remove them.

Bottom line: So far I'm still reading books more than half the time on my phone..."
Stacie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incoming freshman college student, first time kindle user.

I love this kindle, it's the first one I have ever bought and the last I'll need for years. I think it's a prime example of if it ain't broke, dont fix it, and of the good parts of capitalism. The kindle has not really needed any fundemental changes since it's conception, bezel size is necessary so you dont frustratingly change the page on accident, doesnt need a million updates like phones. I think it's an example of good capitalism (minus ecosystem trap) since making reading as easy as possible makes you read more and thus buy more kindle books, which I'm fine with since in the end it means I'll read more!

My motivation for buying this was wanting to read more after realizing I have only read one!!! book in the past two years and that was required reading. It's definitely hurt my vocabulary skills barely reading and wanting to change that going into college I've purchased this kindle paperwhite.

The dyslexia font is my favorite feature, it makes it so easy to read. This kindle is light, small and much better than a paper book. The x ray, wikipedia, dictionary, notes and highlighting features are all you need while reading so theres no need to touch your phone and get distracted for hours. The water proof feature is nice for a peace of mind. The screen ""glitches"" or flashes are simply the e-ink, a small price to pay for a non eye straining, glare free experience. Also the special features is not distracting like normal ads would be since it's black and white and only on the home screen so I didnt even notice!

Overall I'm excited to finally read more going into college. (Plus student discount!!!) It's something ive wanted to do more of but never could follow through with, dyslexia and distractions have always got in the way. Thank you amazon for making such a superb product."
Thomas K.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery drained in less than 12 hours on the first one I ordered and I wasn't even using it. Customer Service was great and sent me a replacement right away. Guess what, the battery drained in about 10 hours with no use. Fortunately, I have an older generation that does last weeks. Again, Customer Service was great and worked a total refund for me. I give up on this generation of Kindle. Really, this one isn't ready for sale with this kind of problem. I guess I'll wait a couple of years for an improved version and hope my old one keeps chugging. I go backpacking and camping a lot so the battery life is critical. I loved the storage capacity for all of my books, which is why I considered this new generation to begin with, but the battery is a fatal flaw."
M K Temple,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to think a dedicated e-reader was a waste of money, since you can download the Kindle app to other devices. A few years ago, a friend gave me her second-generation Kindle with 3g because she preferred the Kindle app on her iPad. I was hooked, and used the Kindle constantly, until the past few months, when the controls became unreliable. I traded it in for a 10th generation, 8 gig Paperwhite (free shipping, a $5.00 gift card and a discount on the purchase). I didn't expect to like it as well as the original Second Gen, but hoped it would be adequate. The Paperwhite is just as easy to read, but smaller and thinner (even with a hardshell Fintie case--the slimmest I could find), and the controls are much simpler and intuitive, easy to use. Battery and storage seem adequate, so far. To my amazement, I like it better than the old one! I ran into my friend last week and told her I'd traded the old one in, and she said, ""Did you get a Paperwhite? Don't you just love it!!!"" She and her husband have both abandoned their iPads, at least for recreational reading. Props to Amazon for actually improving on a winner."
Tiffany,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Obsessed with it! I am a huge book reader, and what’s kept me from getting a kindle was the thought “I love physical books and holding a book” so I was worried I wouldn’t enjoy reading as much with a kindle. I was wrong lol
Not only do I read way faster on the kindle (maybe because it’s a simple tap of a finger to turn a page), but I can have multiple books I’m reading with me in my purse with something that is so light weight, it’s incredible.
I haven’t tried out the “water proof” side of it, although I have read in the bath and that was nice not freaking out! I’m sure in the future, poolside reading will be amazing!
Backlight is great, I can read in bed after the hubs has gone to sleep!
Overall, I’m super excited about it! I spend less time scrolling on my phone and more time reading, because it is that easy and effortless to read with a kindle (only need a hand and a thumb to click like a phone lol)"
Oregon Skier,4.0 out of 5 stars,"On the plus side, the Paperwhite is light; the waterproof feature is a nice thing; and the battery-efficient back-light is great for reading at night. I also like the whole concept of an e-book simply because so many books fit in so small a space. On the negative side, these issues: 1) After all these years Kindles still do not show a correct percentage-remaining indicator if you are reading a book with appendices, such as a histories or biographies. I reached the end of the last book I read, to my surprise, at something like 72% completed (the other 28% being footnotes and bibliography). It would be nice to know how far one has to go in the text the author intended everyone to read. 2) Maps and photos in the Paperwhite render poorly. I have ended up opening Kindle books on my smart phone reader when I want to look at pictures or maps because the images on the Paperwhite are too grainy to sort out if they involve any detail or small writing. However, for straight text, the Paperwhite it is just fine. 3) Most of the touch screen is one big ""page forward"" trigger, which means you have to keep your hands quite close to the edge to avoid inadvertent page turning and be very intentional when attempting to back up a page -- so it can't really be held as one might hold a book. Being able to adjust those areas or desensitize some of the areas would be great -- I have inadvertently advanced to the next page quite a few times. 4) Some books make liberal use of footnotes that the author plainly intends the reader to read along with the text -- using them as a sort of entertaining side commentary. However, in the Paperwhite it is not easy to trigger the footnote-reader reliably; attempts to touch the footnoted number on the screen will sometimes show the footnote, other times turn the page, and still other times result in a Wikipedia-like definition for the particular footnote number itself (say an exegesis on the number 1). Overall, while the Paperwhite is an improvement over my ancient DX, I was expecting more advancement in the reader experience in the 10 years or so since they were first introduced. Nevertheless: The battery-efficient back-light and waterproof aspects are welcome improvements."
busygirl,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was in the market for an e reader tp replace a 10+ year old one from another provider. Since the time I purchased my first e reader, the kindle had far outstripped my original brand, so I started researching it as an option. I ultimately picked the kindle because of the reviews and the number of books available.

While the paperwhite does its job, I do not consider it spectacular or above and beyond just a normal item.

Pros:
I like the light. Reading in bed does not disturb my husband.
Storage-I have a lot of audible books, so I chose the 32g version.

Cons:
Battery life isn't anywhere near the claims. The most I have gotten out of it is 2 days, and that is with airplane mode on since the paperwork indicated slow wifi would shorten the charge life.

Tap/swipe to turn page is awkward and I still haven't adjusted from the physical page turn of my other brand."
CB,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First - I like the size and weight. Much smaller and LIGHTER than either of the two previous kindles I have owned. I also like the long battery life. Having been accustomed to my second Kindle, I miss the color screen. I miss the ability to turn the Kindle any direction and the print will also flip. I miss the ability to change the font size. (Or have I just not learned how to change the font?) I am still adjusting to the way the pages turn. At the present time, it seems slow to turn. I will keep it, but had hoped it would be the best of two generations of Kindle."
Benzie,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I first bought this generation pw on release day. The unit couldn’t be charged because the cable provided didn’t fit. Returned. Fast forward to March this year. A sale! Traded in my old kindle for discount. The kindle sent had a bright spot in the reading area. Returned for exchange. New kindle has another bright spot in a different area. WTH. I regret trading in my perfectly working older kindle for this junk! Quality control appears to be non existent for this generation kindle. This was my final return and I am just going to use my iPad mini from now on. I don’t like the glare, but at least the screen is good. You had one job kindle..."
R. B. Meek,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned almost every model of Kindle produced. This is my third Paperwhite and they just keep getting better. It's waterproof, but I'm 73 and I don't read in the tub, so it's not important. There are complaints from people but the entire purpose of a Kindle is to disappear while reading and this Kindle does that in spades. It's slightly lighter and thinner and because I don't carry it in a situation where it might get a scratch, I don't use a cover, so it just sits lightly in my hand waiting for a thumb to touch it and turn the page. I have hundreds of books from Amazon but never got close to filling my second generation Paperwhite, so the extra storage, while nice, isn't that important. It does take a little longer to wake up, less if you disable ""power saver"" in settings, but again that is not an issue with me. Four or five seconds isn't going to ruin my day. It is a Kindle e-reader and, in my opinion, the best they make. Nothing more need be said."
Kindle Customer/Read This Book,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fave Kindle E-READER I've bought since 2010. Easiest to navigate all commands. Lighting-most soothing for night reading. I turn off ""Light"" daytime, outside. Control fonts.. size control, too many positive improvements I've experienced by upgrading and selling back old Kindle E-READER's to Amazon!
There are NO distractions, like reading Amazon Kindle BookApp, while using any type of Tablet and smart phone! Exactly like reading a paperback. I don't wear 1.5 magnification reading glasses. I enlarge font size, can change font style, make it all in BOLD if it's easier for my eyes to read. I love reading. I learned past 8 years, my eyes weren't 20/20. Reading blurry, I'd reread same lines multiple times,causing me to not read! Too frustrating, effort from poor reading vision caused decreases reading comprehension. Kindle keeps me in love with reading. If Kindle E-READER's weren't available, I know I WOULD STOP READING from frustration and headaches!"
Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I Love the paper white kindle. I have been reading on a 3 generation keyboard model till last month when I finally had to trade it in for the newest edition. I didn't want to but I am glad I did! This thing it the tits! Touch screen, waterproof, built in light, damn man, just damn. I love the small size too, I don't have to much room in my pants for a lotta extra so the smaller size is nice. Like when I'm riding the light rail and feel like disconnecting from reality when the crazy homeless guy starts asking everyone why we are in his house and if we have seen his cat Steve that has recently went missing. Thank you Amazon for this little gem, your doing good things!"
applephx,3.0 out of 5 stars,"You would think a huge company such as amazon could hire great product designers but it is not the case.

The light finally dims to nearly off compared to original paperwhite but it is a blueish light and a warmer color is better for the evening. The difference between the dimmest light and off is a lot. In a dark room the dimmest light is too bright and of course off is too dark.

How is there no ""find my kindle"" feature yet?

Positives:
The storage is finally improved which was needed since they provided no expansion slot since the Kindle Keyboard.

Bluetooth audio is added after years of having no audio option since the kindle keyboard (one of the best designed kindles yet).

Waterproof is fun.

For the price it doesn't seem like we get as much as we could with a better design but it is a step in the right direction at least."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded my old kindle because I read at night and I wanted reversed view and some waterproofing as I spend a lot of time on the water. I also disliked on the old kindle to have that little edge around screen that would cast a shadow on 1/3 of a page when under specific angle to the sun. That bothered me a lot. That is much better now with a new kindle being flush.
I read a lot and loved my old kindle, but this one I am not so sure about. Battery life is BAD. Comparing to my old kindle, it's a joke. But the worst thing is a new design of a button. It is very soft and touchy and the way I usually hold the kindle, triggers screen lock all the time! Also, there is no way to put it for example on a table in a front of a coffee cup without triggering screen lock and pressing a button! What did engineers think when designing this? Do they even use kindle?
I know I could use landscape mode, but I do not like it. Does not feel like a ""book"". If I did not trade my old kindle I would probably return the new one..."
Elizabeth Wilson,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t like much of anything about this KINDLE. It’s waterproof ... I imagine that is a big deal if you are a scuba diver who likes to read at the bottom of the ocean. Also, I can’t help but feel taken advantage of by Amazon. First, I have to BUY the charging device. Then, I have to pay to skip all those “clever” special offers that are actually just ads. That’s all, just paid advertisements. There’s also that claim that the battery charge lasts for weeks. Currently, I am conducting my own little, admittedly not very scientific, but somewhat interesting test. I ran my current Kindle (generation 4) all the way down. Then, I ran this “super battery” Generation 10 battery down. Fully charged both of them and used them for equal periods of times during the past three days. Results: Kindle 4 has 57% battery life left. Kindle 10 has 54% battery life left. Wow. So much for that weeks long charge claim. This new Kindle is really a disappointment and complete waste of money. Oh, if you can stand one more rant: the reviews for each book are practically invisible. The stars are tiny, tiny and you must scroll all the way down to seek out the opinions of other readers. Really, when I pick up 10 to read all I think about is how much money I had to spend just to make it readable and that really prevents me from the enjoyment of using it."
Feline,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This kindle paperwhite is my first kindle. I have been reading using the Kindle app on an iPad for years, but the reconfiguration of the home screen in the app made it harder to use recently. So I finally pulled the trigger on a kindle. I love how easy it is to read in daylight. I like how lightweight it is. I dislike that I can't invert the colors for night mode reading the way I could in the kindle app on the iPad and iPhone. I wish I had known about lack of night mode before purhasing; I probably would have saved my money.

Most disappointing was how sluggish the device is. I touch, and there's a hesitation before it responds. I realize my expectations were set by using a completely different device, so I am not marking down a lot for these shortcomings. They are what they are.

Lowering my rating after struggling to get the furthest page read to sync properly on the Kindle. This works seamlessly between iOS Kindle apps on different devices, but the Kindle always updates to a location that is signifigantly behind my actual furthest page read. This is really frustrating. I don't want to have to page through dozens or hundreds of pages to catch up, especially with how sluggish the Kindle is."
Honest Abe,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had my old paperwhite since it's initial release. I traded it in because even after the software updates, & resetting it the battery would only hold for 24 -48 hours instead of 2-3 weeks. I read A LOT. I've had this one since May 30, 2019. The battery on this new model is horrible. I'm now charging it every other day. It doesn't always shut down, even after tapping the button. It doesn't sync with my other devices properly. The touch screen is either way too sensitive or not at all, depending on the day. it's slow to connect to wi-fi, slow to download. I like that this can be read in direct sunlight, and my eyes don't hurt if I read too long as opposed to using the app on my iPad. Super disappointed in this Kindle."
Wesley Lowenfeld,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned various Kindles for a little under a decade and have been generally happy, but this is the first review (ever on Amazon) I have been compelled to write. All the standard Kindle features are present in this new version and mostly work as intended. It certainly feels a bit lighter than previous versions, which is nice. However, if you read at night in bed like I do, you will be disappointed.

Even at the lowest brightness setting with the colors inverted (black background white text), the Kindle is far too bright to read in the dark. Previous Kindle versions (the Voyage in particular) would allow one to set a very low brightness and slowly decrease it as his or her eyes adjusted to the darkness. This is very helpful for people who have issues falling asleep (like me!) and who do not want to turn on an outside light in the room because they don't want to wake a sleeping partner (like me!). This new Kindle version's lowest brightness setting is bright enough to keep me awake and feeling restless rather than drift me off to sleep. It's so bright I can use it as a flashlight in my room, something the old versions could never do. I went through a lengthy process with customer support and they basically just said sorry, there might be a firmware update that allows lower brightness settings, but no timeline for its release.
Too bad, I guess I need to continue with the older versions until then if I want to continue my nighttime reading."
goldenlvr,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to send the first Kindle which I bought during Prime day back, as the pages would skip around and there were too many other little quirks. I would be reading, turn the page, and be 20 pages further in. The font size changes by itself regularly on the first one and also does so on the replacement (though not as frequently), which is frustrating. I still have the issue with the pages turning in multiples but not nearly as bad as the Kindle I sent back. Otherwise, there aren't any complaints, the light is nice and bright, it's an easy size to read in bed with and generally works as it should. Now if Amazon would start including the charger with the Kindle (like most other devices) I'd really be satisfied, I think it's a real rip-off the charger doesn't come with the Kindle. All in all, for someone with poor eyesight and difficulty reading, a Kindle is the way to go. I'm satisfied with this Paperwhite despite it's quirks as it allows me to read comfortably."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality control has apparently gone down the drain. I was quite excited to order a new kindle; I was upgrading from my 4th gen I had been using since 2011. I’ve also used a Fire 7 for low light reading, though this could keep me up and wasn’t great for trips due to the standard tablet battery. My wife had a previous generation paperwhite that I tested for a few nights and I really liked it. Frequent trips to the beach and pool made this model perfect for travel and it’s waterproofing.

When I received it I noticed right away that the device had a few dead pixels on the bottom of my screen, also known as pinholes; tiny holes/pixels that light bleeds through extra bright. They are annoying and distracting in normal mode and tenfold in inverted mode. I figured this was bad luck and exchanged it. I received the second kindle and as soon as I turned it on...more dead pixels, this time right in the center of the screen. I debated just returning both of them and sticking with my 4th gen but I really did enjoy the reading experience so I gave it a third shot; turns out I was luckiest the first time as the third kindle had even more dead pixels even closer to the center of the screen. At this point I strongly debated being done with kindle and trying a kobo. Ultimately I decided to keep the original paperwhite I ordered due to having a kindle library I didn’t want to repurchase and being mostly happy with the other features of the device. 3+ hours of chat and phone calls later to explain why I was keeping the original device and not the replacements.

Battery life seemed fine , slightly worse than my 4th gen, but that made sense as this model had backlighting. The touchscreen is average and occasionally needs multiple presses but it’s an e-ink screen and probably to be expected.

At the end of the day I decided to keep a device with a defective screen as I wasn’t interested in paying amazon more money to try an Oasis or forgetting about my library with a Kobo. Amazon should update their item description and inform people that their new devices will probably have defects; some online research told me that this is the first generation of kindles with widespread screen issues. Their customer service tells me otherwise but can’t give me an answer as to why all three devices has dead pixels/pinholes. I held on to my original kindle for 9 years and is still working without issue. Not sure when I will purchase another e reader but it won’t be another kindle."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to try the Paperwhite because my 2 Kindle Fires are all but impossible to read outdoors due to the glare. HUGE MISTAKE! It stopped working properly within a month, and after multiple hours on chat with a list of people who didn't know the first thing about the Paperwhite OR my issue, and a subsequent live phone call, they offered to replace the device. They did, but they replaced it with a REFURB/USED reader. Did I, or did I not pay for a NEW device? Yeah, that's what I thought. After more chats with ""Customer Service"", & multiple apologies for my ""inconvenience"", Amazon said I should just return both devices and they would refund my money. WOW! Even Amazon thinks it isn't worth trying to provide their customers with a decent reader--easier to just give back the money and walk away. Lesson learned. I say again--BUYER BEWARE, especially if they offer to replace your new device."
Paul Sztorc,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle is a really, really cool product. It's easy to just email yourself documents (pdfs, free e-books from Project Gutenberg, anything really), and they just show up on the Kindle. It syncs all the notes to the cloud, so that if you ever lose the Kindle or need to reset it, you don't have to worry --everything shows up back where you left it, no thinking required. If you want to read in a dark room (or on an airplane at night), you don't even need a reading light. You can invert the colors (to make white text on a black background), meaning that no one around you will be disturbed in the slightest.

The touch screen is very slow and laggy by modern standards, but it isn't a big deal. Still, I'd prefer to always edit the library and connections from a desktop computer, and have it WhisperSync over to the kindle so that I can just use it for reading.

Since humans arrange information spatially, I would especially like a virtual bookshelf, to arrange all my books and papers on. Like the library in Myst 1 (and like my desk/bookshelves in real life). That is my first recommendation.

But the true tragedy of Kindle is the battery. If I leave the kindle on a desk, it lasts forever as advertised; but if I put the kindle into my backpack, when I take it out there's about a 50% chance that the battery will be at 99% and a 50% chance that the battery will have been completely drained, rendering the device useless. It must be bumping into something and turning off and on. I've put a lot of effort into solving this problem, with different cases and packing strategies, but to no avail. It makes me psychologically very stressed about using the Kindle at all and largely ruins the experience. Even if I charge it to 100% the night before, I have gotten on a plane to discover it is back at 0%. This is really disappointing. Lately it has stopped happening but I have PTSD from the previous bad experiences and am almost too annoyed to ever use the Kindle again. If Kindle wants to replace books (which are very durable and whose battery always lasts forever), then this type of experience can NEVER happen at all to anyone again. Therefore, my second recommendation is:

2. Please install some kind of ""lock"" slider-switch, like they had on the top of iPods. You can put it right next to the power switch (or interlocking with the switch), so that people don't miss it. Or just have the power button slide sideways instead of in-and-out. While we're on the subject, the power button sort of sticks out of the casing, which doesn't really go with the sleek aesthetic in my opinion. Just make it a slider button, or hide it in some kind of cavity in the casing.

I hate to give it 2 stars but, for a +$100 product from Amazon, these details are basically enough to ruin it."
framitz,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I previously owned the Nook e-ink reader. It had no light but was easily readable in ambient room lighting.

The Kindle Paperwhite is like a bad joke.
It's dingy and dull display requires the light to be at 90% to read the screen!
Changing pages is over the top annoying! Flashing like out of date technology.
Is mine defective?

Battery life is horrible. After a full charge the battery was already down to 50% after about 6 hours of use.
Rebooting takes over 7 minutes!

The reading experience with this device is unpleasant.
I've looked at an older model and it seemed better.
The first generation Nook was far superior!
I've had my fill. I absolutely do not recommend this device.

Seeking a return and refund."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been happily using a third generation Kindle Keyboard through the 2010's. No built in light but fine for outdoors. And the case I have did have a light just not uniform or well directed. Battery life is fine, charge it every few days. And no touch screen but buttons and a cute keyboard for searching.
Finally, the case cracked and I asked Santa for a new Kindle. The Paperwhite is like a whole new world. I no longer have to even think about the light, It's built in and self-adjusting. I no longer have to think about charging, just notice it as I open to read and do something about it sometime in the next couple of days! And it wakes from sleep or even screen off in seconds.
I do kind of miss the buttons for page turning but getting use to it, Mine is a little fussy about where you touch or how you swipe but not enough to outweigh the wonder of the rest of the experience."
DeAndra Hurley,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so glad I finally broke down and got myself a new kindle. I have had my old kindle for about 5 year now. The battery life in this kindle is amazing!! Lasts for weeks !!
I originally bought this to be able to have the glare free feature for my boat rides and pool time. That is an option I have never had. I am used to my old kindle as in turning the page, this one is a little more finicky and will take some time getting used to. I love how all the kindles will sinc to the page you last left off at on what ever device you used last. Very pleased with my purchase."
M. Kelley,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like that it is waterproof and has audible book playing features with bluetooth. However, it’s August and I just received my 2nd replacement for the one I originally purchased in January. The good news is that Amazon provided excellent customer service and timely resolution for both my returns. The bad news is that the touchscreen feature is inconsistently responsive- sometimes over sensitive and sometimes sluggish, and then it goes completely out without warning. This is my third Kindle paper white. My first and favorite died an untimely death when I dropped it into my pool. I still use the one I bought to replace it and it works very well. I bought this one simply for using at the pool, beach and bathtub. I’m very disappointed in the touch screen performance but as long as Amazon keeps replacing it, I will keep returning it when it goes out."
Jersey Girl,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd Kindle bookreader and i really don’t like it. For some reason, the power on button sticks out from the bottom and every time i stand it up, it shuts down. Why would they do this? I definitely have buyers regret. The only reason i’m not sending it back is because i am using my older paperwhite for regular reading and will only use this while in the pool. The battery life is terrible too but that also may be due to the constant shutting down and turning back on. I keep it in a sleeve so it may be turning on and off randomly while in it. It was a really stupid decision to have the button sticking out."
Amanda L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using my old kindle with keypad for years and its finally dead, thanks to my husband. Anyway, I'm glad I make the upgrade. The battery life is amazing (compare to my old one). Initially I'm worry that the backlight might cause annoyance such like glare, but it doesn't. The backlight is adjustable and I put it in on a dim level. Totally not noticeable during daytime and when I'm reading at night, it doesn't stress my eye either. I didn't test out the waterproof function as I don't need it. The only thing I don't like is the touchscreen mode when reading because I keep touching the corner and the page turn by itself. This problem can be solve by locking the touchscreen, but I'm too lazy to set it up after a few times because it went back to default mode everytime it wakes up.
With my experience with Amazon ereader, I'm sure I will be using this for years unless some accident happen, as all my kindle last me for a long time until I unintentionally smashed them."
Jessa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am really enjoying my Paperwhite. I was a 1st generation Kindle user. My most recent Kindle was getting a bit older, although still functional, it was not the most user-friendly with the weird button set up of previous generations, and I disliked not having a full keyboard. The Paperwhite is a great, lightweight, compact design. The built in light is great for low light especially. I like the touch screen, but find it lagging in comparison to most touch screen items we use these days. Battery life so far has allowed for quite a lot of reading between charges, but nowhere near the life of older generations without that feature. My 1st generation could go for a month or more of solid reading easy, and I couldn't replicate that in this newer version. Overall, it's a 5-star e-reader. I have had a Kindle for so long that I always come back when I think it's time for something new -- its where my books are. :)"
A. Schide,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE IT! It’s so small and light. I just came across the 1st Kindle and the comparison in size and heft is amazing. I can read in bright sunlight while reading on the Kindle app on one of my devices is impossible.
I truly purchased for the waterproof aspect. Grant you, I have yet to toss it into my bathtub or kitchen sink (and don’t intend to 😱), but now my 30 minute soak is accompanied by a good read. Relaxing in a spa works for me for about 5 minutes and then I need something to do. This Kindle extends my relaxation to the 30-minute mark and beyond. But I was still surprised at it’s tiny size. I’m putting a tracking square on the cover do it does not get lost. BTW, my Whitepaper Kindle is sporting a cork cover, supposedly waterproof as well. We’ll see. But if you want to read in sunlight or around bodies of water, this is your book! And I’ve yet to uncover all of it’s features."
smashton818,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the original Paperwhite and it started to slow way down. Despite erasing everything and trying to keep as much free space as possible, it just wasn’t all that useable anymore. I loved it and nursed it along for as long as I could. I finically decided to get the new Paperwhite as it was on sale and had a lot more storage. I absolutely love it! The battery life doesn’t seem to be as good as my old Kindle even after years of use, but it’s good enough. The newer backlight took some getting used to and I had to turn off one of the battery saving features to make it work better for my use. I mainly read at night- in bed. When you wake it up it would blind you with the light of a 15 million lumen flashlight before reverting to whatever light setting you had it on. Luckily this was fixed with a simple setting in the device and now I don’t have to put on sunglasses when I want to read."
Larry A. Stark,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't like the On/Off being on the bottom. I'm constantly setting it on the bottom or trying to hold it from the bottom and it will shut off.

This is about the software:
1) I also don't like that the battery life isn't showing as you are reading.

2) It also would be nice of it to show the title of the book you are currently reading. I've had several questions as to what I'm reading only to have to go back to find out.

3) The ""My Library"" needs to show the whole title. I don't care if it only shows 5 titles or how ever many will fit on the screen, just show the whole title. I downloaded a series of books only to click on the top one to find out that it wasn't the first book. Took me a long while to figure out that if I taped on the three dots on the far right that it would show the whole title. (See Picture)

4) I've had it change the font size on me and I still don't know how it's doing it. I wake up in the morning after having fallen asleep reading to turn it on and have found the font size has changed. Yea you can go back in and reset it but how and why is it changing?"
Christina,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Due to storage and wanting to use less paper to be good to environment reasons, I switched to digital books. It's not 100%, but it is nice to have direct access to a book when I want it. Plus there always good sales for Kindle books. For a few years I used the Fire Tablets, alternating between the 7 and the 8. At the time I choose a tablet because I didn't like the black and white transition between pages on the Kindle and with the tablets I could just swipe the page without seeing extra movement. Overtime the blue light from my tablets started straining my eyes. I used the blue light filter, but I didn't always remember to use it and really, who wants to be staring at an orange screen when reading? I did some research, learned about the electronic ink of a Kindle and read A LOT of reviews and articles about the technology all to comparisons between the standard Kindle and the Paperwhite. In the end switching to a Kindle would be the best option for me in the long run and the Paperwhite was an easy decision as it has more storage capacity. I'm so glad I did; my eyes don't hurt anymore and I get a nice and easy reading experience.

The Device: The outer casing is smooth to the touch and the screen feels good against my fingers—very pristine. It's comfortable to hold for long periods of time. Since I don't like feeling the microfiber lining that is standard with most tablet/e-reader cases, I purchased a sleeve on Etsy to keep in when the device is sitting around in the house or in my purse.

The software: After reading up on electronic ink, I appreciate it more than I did before. It's nice to look into the screen and see all of the items as I would an actual paper book. It's all straight forward, you get your Kindle books, the Kindle book store, you can leave reviews, connect to your Goodreads account (if you have one), and a few extras settings, like device options, changing the font, ETC. The screen is glare free and the brightness can be adjusted.

The power/power button: I noticed in my review hunting that some users don't like the placement of the power button, but I've found that I don't mind it. It's not bothersome. It doesn't get in the way. When I'm done reading all I have to do touch the button as opposed to reaching for the top. With a light touch of the power button the screen will fade to an ad. The ads are also nice way to discover titles and deals. I had to Google to find out if there was another way to shutting down the device and found out that if you hold the button down for 5-6 seconds you can turn the screen off. Just as turning it off, just the littlest touch turns the Paperwhite back on; an improvement over the Fire tablets where the power button has to be held down for several seconds and the software then takes time to load up.

Battery: I've had the Paperwhite for a little over three weeks and I haven't had to charge it once. I do wish the Paperwhite came with an adapter instead of just a USB cord since I don't want to have to turn on my laptop to charge it, but as I said I haven't needed to charge yet so I'm trying to stay positive. I have the adapters that come with my Fire tablets that I can try if I don't want to use my laptop. That or I can just buy one.

Storage: I got the 8 GB. Near two of that is taken up by files that run the system; that's to be expected. I would've never filled up the other option of a 32 GB. Books can always be removed from the device to free up space. Removing from the device doesn't remove mean it gets deleted from my Amazon library.

I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a good e-reader."
C.A. Strongheart,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the last 11+ years I've been using a generation 2 Kindle. I loved it. I missed the first of the upgrades a number of years ago, which means I couldn't upgrade the software this last time. I decided it was time to bite the bullet and upgrade devices.

I looked at all the reviews on all the choices available and changed my mind a number of times. Change can be difficult. I was sure I was going to not like anything that wasn't the original Kindle I had spent so much time with over the years. Surprisingly, the transition from ""change, ugh!"" to ""this is really nice"" didn't take long at all. I'm not crazy about the home page showing me all of the books still on my wish list, and really wish home was just my library -- but that is pretty minor.

This Kindle has all the stuff I loved about my last Kindle and a few extras. I haven't tested the waterproof function yet, I've not used the little light, and it is much lighter than the gen 2. The battery life seems fine. I couldn't tell you in hours, but it seems to lasts quite a long time.

I like it. So... will this one last another 10 years?"
Jim,1.0 out of 5 stars,If possible it would have a - minus rating. This was advertised as having a charge that lasts weeks. Nonsense. You can not turn it off. Once you close the protective case it turns back on in a sleep mode and the battery drains even in airplane mode so it's not searching for or using wifi. By days end charge is 13% and haven't even used it. Waste of money I am returning it. Save yourself the aggravation and just use the regular fire tablet with Kindle App. Very disappointed with this product.
Milagros,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say that I am pleasantly pleased with the Kindle Paperwhite. I am an avid reader and have been asked 1,000's of times why I don't have a Kindle. Simply put, I wanted to hold the book in my hand. Well just about a month ago, I realized how miserable I have been since I have not been able to read any books (as I have been very busy) and holding a book in NYC subway IS impossible. Anyway, I borrowed a friend's fire and started reading.....I admit, I was hooked and went ahead, threw in the white flag and ordered my first Kindle, the all new waterproof (so I can read by the beach) with 2x the storage. WOOOOOHOOOO! I am a very happy reader. It's so small comfy, fits my hand, and I can use it on the subway and throw it into my bag and at moments time. I am very pleased! Read various reviews about the battery and decided to keep my WiFi off until needed in order to conserve battery. So far that has worked the best. I got my Kindle yesterday afternoon, fully charged it and read from 8pm last night until about 10pm and from 8am today until about 9am and I have 97% of my battery. LOVE IT! I have all my books already downloaded, I am a happy camper. Kindle and I will be friends for a while....(shhh, don't tell my friends I gave in). :)"
Nurse_Jay,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this when my old kindle paperwhite met its untimely demise in my backpack against a hydroflask with an ill fitting lid.... needless to say the waterproof upgrade on this version was rather intriguing. However, when upgrading models you expect to get improvement and not slide backwards. Yes the waterproof thing is great... but why the heck is this newer version worse in every other aspect?!? For example the lag in waking this thing up is way beyond annoying. Same goes for the lag between pages and when you tap the home button. Also the battery life of this thing is about 50% of what my old paperwhite was. All in all I’m totally bummed by this thing."
ABB,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm extremely frustrated with this Kindle. There is an easy way to adjust the brightness but it isn't bright enough. I had it all the way up and it wasn't as bright as the earlier Kindles. Also, the home screen where titles are listed are difficult to read. I wish there was a way to adjust font size on that screen (make it more accessible for those of us who have low vision). There is a great selection of fonts and sizes to choose from in reading regular books. I bought this Kindle because I needed more memory for audiobooks. This Kindles does not come with a speaker phone. You need to pair it with another Bluetooth device to hear it. Again, this is a step backwards from earlier Kindles where this was possible. I'm returning this Kindle."
Jeannie Buss,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this so I could have way more storage, and that is a huge plus for me. Its been working well for me, and I actually like having the book recommendations pop up on my screen before I unlock it. The only downside, and reason for a 4 star review is the smudges. I had the 2015 Kindle Paperwhite before and had no problems with it. With this one, I'm wiping down the screen before I read as I can see it while I'm reading. This is frustrating as a reader, especially when my other one didn't have it.

Also something Amazon might want to highly consider that I miss about the actual book in hand. It would be nice if the covers of the book were in color instead of black and white. That would make it feel more like a book. Now I know many will say, well if you want that than just get the real thing. But with how much I read, I would fill a room if I did that. The Kindle is super light and perfect for me to carry in my purse for wherever I go."
Siawilin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"While the specs seem to show the new Paperwhite to be equal to the Voyage, which isn't being produced anymore, I have found it a step down from what I had. But I couldn't pass up the trade-in value plus 6 months free Kindle Unlimited, plus 25% off (or was it dollars?)-anyway, I basically got a brand new hot off the assembly line Paperwhite for free in trade for my 4 year old Voyage. And as I get used to it, I imagine I'll like it more.
Okay-here I am a couple of weeks in. NO, I don't like it more. I have to charge it about every 2 days, which means that when I go into the hospital next week, I'll have to take my charging cord. And that same cord, which had to be replaced because the first one wouldn't go in, is very hard to insert into the slot or pull out. Because of that, I'm downgrading my rating to 3 stars. If I had it to do over, I'd keep my 4 year old Voyage and wait for better things.
Here it is-almost 2 months later and I'm slowly bonding with my new Paperwhite, hence the raise in the rating to 4 stars. I'm still disappointed in the life of the battery-only 2-3 days, at best; but the new charger is FAST, so it only takes a short while to charge. I still don't like the formatting changes that have been forced on us-so that it takes several clicks on tiny spots to get back to the library list. That one festers, since I'm reminded every so often. This Kindle is very responsive to the touch to turn the page, so that is nice. Still missing my Voyage, though."
PandaV,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They claim this has no glare, it does which makes it hard to read at a normal angle.
The charging cable that comes with it does not fit, this should not be an issue and there are a lot of complaints about this too.
The battery does not last as long as they claim, but it does charge fast so that is a plus.
There is no lip on this one and the space around the screen is thin which makes it really easy to touch the screen and change the page before you need too, big disappointment for me there."
JH,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Love the integrated light and that it's waterproof

Cons: It constantly turns off while I'm reading. The power button is on the bottom, exactly where your pinky supports the kindle when holding it with one hand. It doesn't matter which hand I hold it with either, my finger will end up bumping the button. Same if you place it on the tray of a treadmill or bike. I had the old kindle keyboard which had a slide to power on/off switch at the bottom which was much better. With this power button you just barely touch it and it powers off. This all could be avoided if the power button was on the top, or if they at least gave the option to flip the screen upside down in the software so you could hold it with the button on top, but the only option for changing the screen orientation is to make it landscape.

The other annoying thing is turning the pages one-handed. It's hard to turn the pages forward if you're holding it in your left hand because you have to either contort your left hand to do a swipe or use both hands and tap the right side with your right hand. Again, the eight year old kindle keyboard had a better design where it was easy to turn pages forward and back regardless of what hand you were holding the kindle in."
Review Queen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very easy on the eyes, unlike a tablet, computer or phone. Love the waterproof part, as I use it in the kitchen to try out recipes from the many cookbooks on Kindle Unlimited. I will always read paper books because I like how quickly I can flip back to pages I want too read again, but the Kindle is so portable. II can slip it in my purse so get lots of extra reading moments in.The cover that came with it is really good quality. I got the green, my teenager got the blue kindle and matching blue cover.. she loves them. Both my teen kids now have Kindles, so the shared library is a great feature... see what they are reading. Nice conversation starters. 5 Star! I like the parent controls on it as well. I can give my child the access I feel comfortable with. MY ONLY complaint is that the ""kids"" free time setting is pretty immature for a tween kid, yet the full open access to everything is a bit too open... Amazon needs a better age division set up for Free time books."
kathykirk,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I almost didn’t buy this because of negative reviews but decided to try it. I live just outside of town so my jet pack WiFi didn’t work nor did my hot spot on my iPhone. Customer Service sent me another one the next day . Instead they should have told me to try WiFi in town. After studying the issue I went to McDonalds and low and behold it worked. Now my iPhone hot spot is suddenly working too. I don’t know what the complainers were talking about. There are no pinholes and everything works beautifully. If you want color don’t buy a Paperwhite. Simple, or just look on your Kindle app on your phone to see the color book cover then read the book on your Paperwhite. It is not a note book. It’s simply for reading and ordering reading material. That is why it comes at such a great price plus you get an excellent e reader. So far I love it. It only gets 4 stars because the battery is not living up to Amazon’s promises of weeks of battery life. I can live with that. Also I’m an avid reader so batteries probably can’t keep up with me."
Melissa Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this Kindle! I had a different brand of e-reader years ago and I liked it, but it did not have a light & it wasn't very user friendly. In order to add books, they had to be purchased online, then the e-reader had to be connected to my computer in order to download books.
I usually just read books using my iPad & the Kindle app. I received this waterproof (‼️‼️🙌‼️‼️) Paperwhite for Christmas & I love everything about it! It's the perfect size and weight to use with 1 hand. It is easy to adjust the brightness to see at night & in daylight. I love all the extras, highlighting, dictionary, bookmarks, font adjustments, & more! And the battery life is amazing! Oh, and did I mention it's waterproof?! I can safely read at the pool or beach (or in the tub!) without putting it in a baggie for protection!
And it's so user friendly! Connect to internet, sign in to or create a Kindle account, choose your book, put it in your library and read away!"
N. Brown,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love books...analogue is my middle name. However, books are heavy and sadly, not worth a whole lot when you try to sell them. Pity.
In an effort to literally lighten my load, I finally caved in and bought a Kindle ad an el cheapo case.
I like it. a lot
Honest: I was prepared to dislike item; but have to admit, I'm reading more now than before and take the Kindle everywhere with me to read. It fits in my purse and pack.

With the back-lit light, I am even reading in dark of night. It's like a pet.

I do have to remember to charge it then take the cables with me; ignore Oprah's stupid ""summaries""; and, sales pitches from Amazon. You can buy cheaper hard cover books on Amazon, but storage and carrying items problematic...esp. if you travel a lot. There are gazillions of titles you can get. The Kindle is small, light, and, portable. Some books are on Audio--perfect for the illiterate out there. Why read?

Try one...You can do pretty much with it, but it does not ""smell"" like a good read.... It solves lots of challenges."
Terri,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have vertiginous migraines so LED lighting causes me to get vertigo. I am also very light sensitive. I first purchased one of the older paperwhites and had to send it back because the light was on continuously and also way too bright for me even on the lowest setting. So I was a little hesitant at ordering this newer version but am so glad I did! First, let me say that I called Amazon customer service before buying this and asked the question - 'can you turn the backlight completely off when you did not need it?' I was told no but then was told by a friend that yes you could turn it off - so I took the chance and ordered it. And YES you can turn the light completely off when it is not needed which is a huge plus for me.
The lighting on this paperwhite compared to the older version is also much easier on the eyes and does not cause me to get my migraines. So if you have concerns about LED lighting then I'd say give this one a try anyway, you may like it. I know I sure love mine.
Also, the size of this is great, I love that I can toss it in my purse and always have my book along to read wherever I go."
MKC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my replacement Kindle for about 3 weeks. The first Kindle I received lost battery at approximately 12%/hour with no internet and no usage. After over 1 hour ""chatting"" with Amazon, they offered to send me a new, replacement Kindle. And they were very prompt. Unfortunately until I got to ""troubleshooting"" I wasted a lost of time with the first Amazon rep. And I didn't realize I had a battery issue until I had spent about 11 hours downloading my 1,000+ books.
PRO's: 32G. The only reason I purchased the Kindle. I already had 2 Paperwhites which functioned fine. But I had some books on one Kindle and some on the other. 32G allows me to have all my books on one Kindle. What a great feeling to know I have 24+G of storage available instead of 600 mb. Other than that, the Kindle functions the same as my other Paperwhites, including the same ""glitches."" The screen is very readable, much better for ""old eyes"" that trying to read on a tablet., I've loved reading on a Kindle since my first keyboard Kindle.
CONS: I miss my 3G connectivity, which I have on my other 2 Kindles. It took me about 11 hours to download all my books. And I had to do it twice because the defective battery on the first Kindle. I found I could only download about 8-10 books at time. Whether that is an Amazon problem or my internet carrier's problem, I don't know. The Kindle is smaller, not so much the screen as the area surrounding the screen. Less to hold onto and easier to accidentally move the screen forward or backward. I don't like the Kindle leather cover as well as the prior cover. I miss the protected cutout (best I way can describe it) around the charging area and the on/off switch.
NOTE TO AMAZON: Thank you for the 32G. Some of us want our library accessible no matter where we are and not in the cloud. Please do not make the Kindle any smaller in physical size. And it would be great to be able to listen to an Audible book and follow along with the Kindle book - on the Kindle. Lastly, I want to continue to add to my library. But the cost of books is getting scary. No paper, no ink, no physical book, a limited number of downloads, no trade in value or sharing capability (for the most part) - yet Kindle books are almost at pocket book pricing. Even ""reprints"" of previously published books - think 20+ years ago - have escalated significantly in cost."
Book Mom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't entirely sold on the idea of an eReader (I'm a paper book hold out), but decided to give it a try. I really love the ease of having multiple book at any time. No need to worry if I'm about to finish one, no waiting to order/ship if I want the next in a series. One think I would like is the feature on my phone's Kindle reader that allows you to contiunously scroll the pages instead of just skipping to the next page. And a ""paper scent generator"", so I can believe I'm holding a paper book in hand. lol Overall, I am very happy with my Kindle Paperwhite. Great product, great price, great convenience!"
Mat,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty nice. I used a tablet for a long time but constantly having to charge a battery or carry external batteries for long trips just isn't practical. The Paperwhite weighs a fraction of a tablet so it's easier to hold for longer periods of time. The built in backlight is very good for reading at night when no light is available or other people are trying to sleep.

The ads are annoying so I recommend paying to get rid of them. If you don't have a cover the ads stay on and drain the battery quicker. Either that or you cover the sensor manually.

I only give this 4 stars because transferring existing books that you don't buy from Amazon is more difficult than it should be. I often get errors trying to email books or have to retry in Calibre several times. The integration with many public libraries is a solution around this problem and works really well. I'll checkout a book I own just because it is easier.

On a separate note, these should be in color by now. I have an extensive e-library and the conversion of many graphics to grayscale just isn't good. Don't need high resolution but some basic color is needed. I knew this wasn't a color device but the grayscale (or conversion) is more disappointing than I expected."
Ebkelly,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a Kindle Voyage which I love! But, its about 4 years old and I had a few issues so when I saw the Paperwhite had been redesigned and included Audible, plus on sale, I thought I'd pick it up. I have not tried the Audible feature yet. But, I miss the ability to press a spot on either side to turn the page forward or back. And, I miss the adaptive light. It's not *that* big of a hassle to change the screen brightness but, auto screen lighting is nicer. And I have accidentally opened books when trying to flip the pages in my library. Plus, I think the power button on the bottom, right where I put my finger to hold it up, is a bad idea. So, I might just go back to my Voyage. And, when it dies, I'll have this Paperwhite as a back up."
Sky Lark,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am updating my review. I found that the more I used my new Kindle Paperwhite, the longer each charge has lasted. My first review expressed disappointment that the battery does not last as long as advertised. While still true, it lasts a long time, it charges quickly & I am happy with it. The on/off button on the bottom is still a a bad placement, but with familiarity I rarely turn off by mistake, though I have to store it on its side in the adjustable cradle I bought for my last Kindle.
I still don’t find the LED light any different or better than the light on my older Kindle. The settings & fonts are also the same. Getting it wet was never an issue & I don’t do audio books.
When you add in the plug, cover & warranty it’s much more expensive.
However, I couldn’t read without it. I’m older and my reading vision is not great. The Kindle allows me to size the font to a comfortable level.
This is my 3rd Kindle, 2nd Paperwhite. I read a great deal so even at the higher price I’m glad I bought it."
Jode,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this Paperwhite. I still have my original kindle with the keyboard, I love it but the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge like it used to. I own a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9"" I love that I can do more than read, but if I just want to read, I prefer a lighter reader. This one is lightweight, waterproof, and holds a charge for a long time. I haven't figure out how to load my book collections on it, or how to add to a collection from it yet, but I am still very pleased. Only thing that would be better is if it had come with the cell connection at the low price I got it for. I spend a lot of time in hospital so being able to connect it without having a wifi (like my original kindle does) would have been amazing, I just couldn't afford the extra price. I read other reviews about a bright light in a tiny dot on the screen, my screen is flawless, so if there was a problem in earlier manufacturing, there is none now. I recommend this to any one that loves to read. You can carry thousands of books in your purse, and the price of a kindle book is such a great value and many authors give away books free when they first come out....did I forget to say I LOVE AMAZON!!!"
zoncustomer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"in 8 days the battery was down to 10%. When I got it, it had between 40 and 50% battery life. I thought I would see how long it last. 9 days to 10% and I used it maybe 1 hour a day, rarely 2 hours. at this rate I think it will run down about every 16 days. I thought the new one had more battery life. My old paper white had much better battery life. I do not recommend this new kindle. I so regret trading in my good Kindle. I thought since I had it for 4 years, it might be time for a update. I was sooo very wrong. I think Amazon should RECALL.
all of them and put in a decent battery.

I did exchange it for another one, the battery was still disappointing.
I am considering returning and buying a reconditioned one. so sad I traded in my old one.

UPDATE: talking to Amazon as I understand it battery is used up more than with the 2014 model that I had because of all the extras like the LED lights and audible (which I do not use). Plus I think it loads faster than the 2014 model. unless I have misunderstood. anyway. I am impressed with Amazon on communicating with me recently by contacting me.
Thank you Amazon for careing.."
Chuck,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th Kindle and 2nd Paper White. I've especially enjoyed the Paper White but wished it had included audio, a larger storage capacity as I read several hours a day & go through books like a bowl of popcorn. This newest PW unit includes my wish list items plus additional facets that will appeal to avid readers. After subtracting the $ value of the Special Offer including $25 trade in value for the old Kindle, $59.94 for 6 months free Kindle Unlimited Trial & a $25 gift certificate, the new much improved PW unit was only costing me $20.05.. Hard to pass up such a real special offer that adds considerable to one of life's true pleasures.... reading."
Marie Butson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this with a trade-in to replace my older Kindle for more memory and and built-in light feature. After two weeks, I’m very happy with this Kindle Paperwhite. The built-in light is adjustable so if it’s too harsh in a dark room, or not bright enough in the light, you can tweak it as needed. I’m hoping to try the bluetooth feature with an Audible book sometime."
Sarah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only used reader apps on my phone or tablet before now, so this is my first dedicated reader. So far, I love it. The only thing that made me go with the Paperwhite over the base Kindle was the ability to have white text on a black background, which I use at night.

The UI is easy and relatively intuitive. The screen is crisp and very easy to read. The light is way less intrusive in a dark room than my phone, which makes it easier to fall asleep when I am done reading.

I don't have a problem with glare or fingerprints that some other people have had. And, even if I didn't have the case, the power button being at the bottom of the device doesn't affect me as I hold the side.

The battery life is good as far as I can see.

IMHO, the only thing I could add would be color. But, we're a few years from that in these devices.

The only complaint is that, when waking up the device out of a long sleep, it does power back on at full brightness. Which was a little jarring the first time."
Birkie,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to this new device because of the waterproof feature, battery life and ability to listen to audio books again. Waterproof will be nice though I've never needed that particular feature, audio will be nice when I get the blue tooth but the battery life is a fraction of what my 2016 Kindle was capable of. I use to charge my old device every 1.5 - 2 weeks, now its several times a week. I thought I just got a bad device and so they sent me a replacement that showed up yesterday. I set it up, plugged it in to charge and then left it overnight. It was at 100% this morning and now with about 1.5 hours of reading so far today it is already down to 92%. I'm wishing I hadn't upgraded."
Anna Lang,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don’t buy the kindle paper white!!!
New kindle paper white doesn’t work, skipping pages, dictionary keeps popping up, highlight and undlining text and then freezes. I have reset and restarted countless times, charged battery for 48 hours, still doesn’t work!!! Amazon customer service just kept sending me links to fix the problem, but doesn’t fix the problem!!! Amazon you need to step up and replace this item!!!"
Sean,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle is a great product.

Some people have reverted back to paper/bound books. I have not. The ability to change font size has fundamentally changed the way I read books. In high school and college I struggled through the long/endless classics - War and Peace, Anna Karenina, Don Quixote. I never finished any of them. With the Kindle I increase the font size, and finish the books in five weeks.

My latest version (version 10) is great. The battery life is better. The screen is a little better. The entire surface is the screen. While it is a little sensitive you adapt quickly. I'm assuming future versions the entire surface will be the screen, which will be great.

Every parent with son(s) get them to read on a Kindle. Increase the font size. The classics are well told stories. Repeatedly tapping the right side of the screen generates the same neural response as playing a video game. The subtle addiction keeps them focused. The story does the rest."
Steph,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had SPD my entire life. It has gotten in the way of my love for reading since one of the things that sets my SPD into overdrive is the texture of paper on my skin, especially my fingers. I decided to try my husband’s Kindle Paperwhite and loved it, so I just had to get my own. For the first time in years, I was able to finish a book. It was so relieving to do so since it felt like my brain had been turning to mush after years of not actively reading.

Other things that I love about this device:

- The adjustable brightness and anti glare screen are fantastic since I have sensitive eyes.
- Super easy to use and navigate.
- The battery life is astonishing. I was able to use it all day and not have the battery drop below 85%.
- Very lightweight. My hands and wrists get enough abuse since I work on computers, tablets and smartphones all day. I do not feel strained after using this for hours on end."
Jessenia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow I love this thing!! It’s so easy to take with me anywhere I go. I can throw it in my purse or in the stroller caddy and still have plenty of room for other things. It’s small enough that it doesn’t cause any trouble to bring along but big enough so it’s not hard to read with. I really like the light dimming options too as I can adjust how bright the screen in when I’m reading in bed or when I’m out and about during the day. I got the amazon case to go with this and the wake up function works well and makes it convenient to just open and pick up where I left off. I also like that I can click a word and it will being up the definition or language translation for me. It’s made reading much easier and helps that I don’t need to stop and look up words on another device.

Long story short, if you want to read books but don’t want to carry them around...just buy the dang kindle!!"
Mad Nomad,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You know, I'm something of a scientist myself.

Bought the brand new. Charging plug would not go in the socket. Weeping. Wailing. Sackcloth. Ashes on head.

THEN. A tall black monolith appeared on my lawn. I knelt before it. Touched it.

Hmm. Maybe it's the plug. There followed a virtual orgy of plug-into-sockets. Phone rejected it. Tablet didn't want it. Some strange-device-I-bought-on-Amazon-that-I-have-no-idea-what-it-does wouldn't accept it. Plug was on the path to being a virgin longer than I was.

Tried the phone cable. It worked. NOW MIND YOU...the socket only took about half of it, but it clicked, made the connection, and the juice flowed. And I'm getting very uncomfortable with this narrative.

So, there ya go. No packing and returning and waiting nonsense. I'm not picky. Brain cells and duct tape and Gorilla Glue. If it works, it works. Leave it alone. Go out and party while it's charging. Feed the cat.

And, to those Ex-Lax addicts who have to have EH-vrything JUST SO, right down to the last digit in the version number: lighten up. You hold in your hands a modern miracle. Work with it. Don't be the Neanderthal sitting in the creek bed for six months looking for the perfect rock."
Kathy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I bought this device, I thought I was buying a device that I would choose how to use, not the opportunity to buy more Amazon content. Amazon content isn’t special enough for me to spend over a hundred bucks to showcase it. I’m happy that Amazon now allows many library ebooks to be circuituously downloaded via a stop on Amazon. I knew about that bit of largesse before I bought. What I failed to research was the fact that you can’t download Hoopla or Scribd content.
Furthermore, I paid extra to get rid of ad content (special offers). The ads are all book recommendations. I don’t consider that a loophole. Those “upcoming releases for you” and “discover your next read” notes aren’t invitations or book club. They’re ads.
Also, the user interface sucks. The Kindle app operates much more easily.
I’m sending the thing back as soon as I delete my stuff.
EDIT (later that day) . . . I guess I’ll keep it after all because it doesn’t hurt my eyes like regular tablets. But all of the above is still true. I am still sorely disappointed about being unable to use it for most of the ebooks I want to read.
Changing 1 star to 2. Not useful enough."
Eric Norton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned two Kindles prior to this one for nearly the past decade: a Kindle 2 and an earlier version of the Paperwhite. Each upgrade improves upon the experience, and Amazon really outdid themselves with this newest Paperwhite! The problem with somewhat irregular lighting of previous Paperwhites has been solved, the updated user interface is more user-friendly than ever and puts all the common commands a single touch away. Text and even graphics are sharper than ever, the contrast between text and paper is remarkably like ink and paper, and, as always, the e-ink screen is free from glare in bright light with the improved lighting making it supremely easy to read in darkness. (Seriously, why would you buy a Kindle without a built-in light anymore?) The battery lasts an exceptionally long time... and even longer in airplane mode. This new Kindle is lighter than previous versions and my hand has yet to get tired from holding it. I can't find a single fault with my new Kindle, and it's already given me countless hours of reading bliss! I couldn't possibly be without it!"
John Galt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been several years since my Kobo died, and after lugging books around and looking at my full bookcase, I've joyfully returned to the e-reader world. I did quite a bit of research, and my experience with the Kindle Paperwhite verifies my research ... it's simply the best reader out there. Likes: super light weight, LED backlight, tons of storage, infinite battery life, ease of downloading books. Dislikes: No usable maps, pictures. I think this is common to most e-readers. I'm reading a book about Winston Churchill, and maps of WWII events would be very helpful. They appear on the Kindle, however they're too small to be legible and not expandable."
SGG,5.0 out of 5 stars,bought my first kindle in 2011 . this is my 8th . My Husband an I love our Paperwhites . Comparing with my 7th this was also supposed to have 3g free . Sadly it is not . Found out on a camping trip . I could not download a book . A Amazon rep. was very helpful . When we both realized no free 3g she suggested and helped me with a free return . After comparing with the other kindles available 32 gb or Oasis both $ 249.00 I decided to keep it and use for downloading up road my older ones . It still shows that it would be able to download books without wifi .
Book Addict 619,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been wanting to upgrade to the newest paperwhite but had held off because mine was still in good condition. But the waterproof aspect really drew me, I love to take my paperwhite to the pool and read but I was always concerned with water getting on. I finally bit the bullet and got the new one when they were on sale for Black Friday and I could utilize the trade in option. That is such a great feature that amazon offers! It brought the price down lower and I feel like I got it for a steal! So far I’ve loved reading on it, it’s not much different than my old one. Just a little smaller. I’ve had it for almost a month now & have only charged it once. But I haven’t been reading every day. Not sure how the battery life will be when I’m on break and can just read for hours. But so far very happy with my purchase! Just waiting on the summer months and pool time."
Sheila McKee,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle so there definitely is some learning curve. I’m used to reading ebooks using my iPad. I love that it doesn’t cause eye strain. I like that it’s small and can easily fit into my crossbody bags. I like that it’s light so I can carry it everywhere. However, it is slow and the screen is too small that I find myself needing to turn the page constantly. It would be perfect if like my iPad I can see the books in color, can easily switch back and forth from kindle to other sites in search of more books or information on a book. And unfortunately, after the free trial, I will not subscribe to the kindle unlimited. The books of the authors that I usually follow aren’t free."
A,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this for about 6ish hours a week to do readings for my college courses and I love having everything in one easy to carry device. The screen and light levels really do make it feel like paper and it doesn't strain my eyes like reading on my laptop usually does. My only gripe is the latency and how long it can take to add a comment or note to a highlighted passage. I type up my notes on my laptop anyway so it's not a deal breaker, but it would be great if it was just a bit faster and more responsive so that I could use this as my only studying device. I received this as a gift so I'm not sure about the price, but if you're a reader and don't mind purchasing books through Amazon then it's handy. I did not test the audiobook features that this offers because I'm not particularly interested in that, but they're there if you're looking for that in a portable device."
Kristy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned several Kindles over the years. It's been a few years (5 or so) since I'd bought a new one. Wow! The improvements are amazing. The built in light is a game changer for me. I had one that needed a book light or the cover with the built in light, but I can use this in bed and totally not disturb my husband. No more glaring light. Instead it's a soft glow.

As I've aged my eyes have gotten worse (as is normal), but it's hard for to read for long periods of time and especially when using a computer and even shorter on a small device. I appreciate there are reading apps for the phone, but honestly the Kindle is so far above the apps it's not even a fair comparison.

The device is small enough to take everywhere. It fits easily in the outside pocket of my purse and I can pop it on the front small pocket of my laptop sleeve. It's easier to hold than a paperback, lighter, and about the same size.

I know there are features I haven't even explored and I can't wait to put it through it's paces. Well done Amazon. I honestly believe this is still your best tech offering."
Beth F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I unfortunately dropped my precious previous generation Paperwhite in the sink (full of water). I was so sad when it didn't turn on the next day! This one doesn't come in white and that was very disappointing, and I was worried to see negative reviews here. I ordered a new one anyway.

Well, it definitely isn't my lovely old Paperwhite. The text isn't as crisp and there are always a couple fingerprints on the edges that can be annoying, but those things aren't enough to really bother me. I don't use audiobooks so I left Bluetooth off and battery life has been great.

I just wanted a Kindle that doesn't get in the way of reading books. This fills that need and isn't too different from my old one. I'm happy."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"very propitiatory - you have to go through Amazon to download anything, I have no complaints with the device but the free and most of the Kindle Unlimited books are not what I like so I have to limit my reading to what I can afford. I can get 7 a month from the library but, once again, limited titles. The Paperwhite itself is easy to use, the advertisements are barely noticeable, and the battery is lasting well. I charge it about every 4 days, but I read a lot as I have chronic pain and read myself to sleep whenever the pain wakes me up. The screen does not strain my eyes and the glow does not wake up my partner. It shuts itself off if I do fall asleep, plus I can read in the bathtub, very nice. It isn't as satisfying as a real book but is so convenient that I don't mind.
I went down a star because I want to listen to audiobooks but can't listen to MP3audiobooks from my library, only to the Audible books through Amazon. I am very unhappy about that. The reader is a great reader, I have no complaints about that, but it is so limited in what I can read with my library card"
Dreedw,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After 7 months it has stopped working despite not having suffered any drop or abuse of any kind. I now need to send it in to see if they can fix it (so much for having a reader during my upcoming vacation). When it was working it had a number of characteristics which I disliked. It is often quite difficult to scroll backwards. Accessing the home page/controls seems to require tapping the screen in just the right spot and just the right way. There is no dark screen option to avoid bothering my spouse at night, just a dimming option which very quickly makes the page washed out and difficult to read. With the power button at the bottom edge of the device it has a habit of powering off inadvertently. Quite surprised by all the drawbacks and the early demise."
Cookie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"it works great. it is real easy on my eyes to read. I can even read in the car in the daylight, I dont have to move around the sun.

I just wish it was bigger so I had more words on the page."
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought I would become an avid e-reader user. I am very old school when it comes to books. For several reasons (free & inexpensive books, not having to find space to store any more physical books, etc.) I finally caved a few years ago and bought my first Kindle. Unfortunately, that one died recently, so I bought this one as a replacement. The main thing I like about the Paperwhite is visually it's like reading a paper book. I was worried an e-reader would bother my eyes the way a computer does after awhile. This doesn't do that. I can read for hours and it doesn't bother my eyes. The storage space is great. I've only had to charge it once since buying it a little over a week ago- and I use it a lot! I'm very happy with this product."
Nick,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only owned the Kindle Fire HDX, so a comparison wouldn't be fitting as they are two completely different devices. I had received this Kindle as a gift from my wife for Father's Day. Reading books on a very glossy screen was troublesome and I always reverted to reading printed books, so this was the answer.

I had read all the previous reviews about poor battery life. This has not been the case for me. But then again I don't know what other people are comparing to with previous devices. I try to read at least 1 hour every day. Currently I have 72% battery life remaining from my last charge a week ago. Personally, I think that is pretty decent, although I have not been using the back light. I do have the Wi-Fi on. Maybe with the last update battery life may have improved.

I have not seen any pinpoint holes or have had any other problems thus far. I think a lot of the reviews are biased as people will seek blood for when something doesn't go their way. ""I'll show you Amazon. One star review for you!""

Anyway, I think it's a decent product. There is still a little glare on the screen at times, but it does the job."
Dee in NY,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently wrote a review on my new Kindle that was not very flattering and I gave it a 2-star rating. My issue was the battery life and the fact that it did not seem to hold a charge for very long. Believe me when I tell you that I was ""stunned"" when 20 minutes later, after my post, I got a telephone call from Amazon Customer Service asking if there was something they could do to help rectify the problem! The woman on the phone walked me through several suggestions and e-mailed me the instructions as well. I did exactly what she suggested and the battery is now holding a charge for longer periods. If you are having this issue definitely take it off WiFi if you are not using it (Airplane Mode) and try taking it out of the cover when charging if you have yours in a case. It does not hold a charge as well as my Kindle Touch did but it is way better than it was and I am grateful for the kind and quick service."
GKL,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Without question, this is the best Kindle Paperwhite I've ever had. I love the water resistance, smooth surface, and fast response. That said, I wish Amazon would take this a step further and create an e-ink Paperwhite/Kindle tablet Phone, with an e-ink display of the same quality as on the Paperwhite, all the apps available for the Kindle tablets, two speakers, standard audio plug, micro-SD card, long battery life (at least 2-3 days between charges), along with a phone and SMS and MMS, threaded and group texting ability, with around a 5 inch display. The Kingrow K1 is an example of what I have in mind, but I'd really prefer an Amazon device."
Sierra Ranger,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally upgraded from my 3rd generation Kindle to the new Paperwhite and I am still getting used to swiping to turn the pages but that’s a minor thing, has a great battery life. Main upgrade for me was the built in light, it makes my reading especially night reading more enjoyable now. I did not opt for ad free and should have! but I can live with it and can always remove them later for a fee. However some new titles I might want to check out and read have come across with the ads. Great buy and excellent price from Amazon and a worth while purchase"
D. Kirkpatrick,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got hung up in book with no way to exit or get back to the Home screen. Just kept showing me the same five book pages. There was no Exit or Back button.

I am a reader of non-fiction, e.g. Biography or Historical, so I wanted to edit my preferences so as to limit reading lists and recommendations - Not Allowed. I have the feeling that the software is buggy.

I also agree with other reviewers that the button on the bottom is a very poor engineering decision. Why do engineers mess with success?

I have only had this for a few days, so have not had a chance to check it out fully. I will take it traveling with me for about three weeks, but may return it when I get home."
Rachel,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle ended up having battery issues and a small point of damage on the screen, I tried to order the exact same thing.

Well it's the same in most way, but as far as I can tell, the cellular connected version wasn't an option. So without cellular this is an inferior device, and the only way I could tell the difference was it forced me to connect to wifi. The last one Wifi was an option. So much for buying books on the go. :(

That said, I do like Kindle Paperweights, and it seems good, although the screen doesn't have the same paper like feel, but it's close, so not a complaint. Splash resistance is nice, until you read the pamphlet and see that if it gets splashed you have to do a major dying effort. Which seems no different to my old not splash proof Kindle.

On the upside the no OS is jazzier, however I like the first Kindle OS best. :/

Overall it's good, but it could be better, a lot better.

p.s. Amazon, make it clear how to get the cellular version, and clearly state if it doesn't have it. Because this was why I go with the paperweight and the cheaper Kindle."
mamunger,1.0 out of 5 stars,"where to begin... pages flip on their own, can't change lighting, can't click links inside book... must go to store to peruse books, while holding paperwhite it often shuts off on me because the on/off button is on the bottom. The paperwhite is less user friendly than an android device with kindle installed! I absolutely hate it!!!"
J. Hudson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit: 1/30/19 Amazon called today, to assist me with my kindle. It was greatly appreciated. My kindle homepage now only shows a list of my books, instead of the complicated new home screen. So, I've raised my opinion from 2 stars, to 3 stars. I still want to get rid of the touch screen, as it is still UN-necessarily, too, involved to find the book, I want to read, with the touch screen. There are over 700 books, in my kindle. I pray, they come out with a paper white, button kindle. I've tried the refurbished ones, but it didn't hold up.

1/29/19Yes, the touch screens are more sophisticated. I guess it's call progress. However, progress is not always good! I do not have fingers the size of a child's! I just have average size adult female fingers, yet, it takes so many try to get where I want to go. I love the paper white screen. I see no difference in battery life, between this kindle and my first kindle, which was the original. I spent more time trying to get to where I want, than I ever did on my first kindle. If they brought out a new paper white kindle with the buttons, I would buy it, even though my present kindle is only a couple of months old! Enough said!!!"
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband bought me this as a Christmas gift. I use it about one hour per night to read before bed. With a full charge on Dec. 25, 2019 it's now Jan. 29, 2020 and the battery is at 30%! Over one month of casual reading on a single charge. I'm blown away by how good the battery life is.

The device itself is fast and user friendly. It replaced a 2nd gen Kindle Paperwhite so I already knew what to expect. No surprises there. The screen is clean and crisp with plenty of customization options.

As much as I love my new Kindle Paperwhite, I have one complaint. The back of it is ridiculously slippery. I've dropped it several times (no damage). My previous Paperwhite had a matte back that never slipped. So I did take one star off. Sure, I could add a case, but I don't like them and don't feel a product should be designed to require a case."
Suzi,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I used it every day and then I went on a trip but forgot to bring it. I left it for about 2-3 weeks during which it ran pretty low on battery.

I came back to it and the screen is frozen the buttons don’t work and it won’t charge.

Useless piece of junk. Just got it and it already broke. What a waste of my money."
Lise P. C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and easy to handle. Light adjustment feature is awesome. I bought the cover for it and am glad I did. The Kindle itself is very smooth and slipped out of my hand when I was reading lying down on my side. The cover has a nice texture that prevents that.
A. Enoch,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle, so I don't know how it compares to previous models. I bought this to do some reading in the pool and for my wife to read in the tub.

First, I found the backlight to be very bright. Too bright to read before bed. So I sought to invert the colors to make the screen black with only the text white. The option is there, but it's buried in the accessibilities menu when it should be an easy to press shortcut.

Second, I have serious doubts on the waterproofing capabilities. I took it to the pool and submerged it. It operates just fine (the touchscreen doesn't work underwater - as expected), but the device retains a significant amount of water inside the device which drains out through the charging port. I wouldn't expect that to be normal, as I had to shake it for some time to get it to stop coming out. I would be afraid to charge it for a few days after getting it wet."
J. Morrill,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved this Kindle until I picked it up to discover that overnight it had lost about 85% of all I had put onto it, much of which I had already added to new-for-this Kindle collections. It had not run out of power, been dropped or maltreated, it just—what? Decided it wanted only four collections instead of three pages of them? Didn’t want to deal with several hundred pages of uncataloged books? Now I can’t trust it to keep the little it still has, much less anything I might add. Has anyone else had this experience with this model?"
punkingee,4.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: I was contacted by Customer Service in regards to this review. I was sent a replacement kindle paper white with the promise that the ""waking up"" message wouldn't come up. It still does.
I guess I'll keep the new one, but if you're contemplating buying this new paperwhite, I still think there's no reason to buy this unless your kindle is not holding a charge.

My old kindle needed to be charged every day. This was a serious decline from its original weeks. So, I decided to trade in my old kindle for a new kindle with ""6 weeks"" battery life. This new kindle needs to be charged every two days. I've been keeping my new kindle on Airplane mode since I saw how fast the battery ran down. This is even though my old kindle lasted at least as long.
Instead of instantly seeing the ""swipe to unlock kindle"". the first display is ""wake up mode"" for several seconds.

I just wish I'd kept my old one."
I. Tower,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a kindle since the very first, the one with a keyboard and a couple of games. I had to replace that one when I dropped it, and that replacement still works fine. But I thought I'd get a paperwhite when we had a recent storm and 2-day power outage and I thought it would be nice to be able to read in the dark.

NEGATIVES: 1 - SHIPPED WITH OLD SOFTWARE: My kindle was shipped with old software. THREE days after I received the kindle it wouldn't download anything unless I rebooted it entirely. After three different calls to kindle technical support (about an hour total) I finally got the new software and it works fine now, which I certainly hope continues. Why the new software wasn't loaded on the device before they shipped it is beyond me, and it was extremely frustrating and time consuming to get that issue resolved. 2 - BATTERY LIFE: In Wi-Fi mode the battery loses charge extremely rapidly. This was true for my other kindles as well. But in Airport mode it seems to lose charge much more quickly than my other kindles. I'm a heavy reader and in the past charged my kindle once a week. I can't imagine this kindle holding a charge for a week. Overnight (with an hour or so of reading before sleep and after waking) it went from 85% to 71% in airport mode. I'll just charge it regularly, but the claims of long battery life are ridiculous IMO. 3 - COMFORT: I don't find the size, weight, thinness, etc. to really matter. I keep it in a book-style cover just like my other kindle, and I prefer that. It protects it and it's comfortable. I used it for a couple of days without the cover and I did not find it particularly comfortable to hold, and kind of slippery.

POSITIVES: Lighting and display are excellent. It's a wonderful reading experience."
Curious,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: Received exchange promptly. New product works & charges fine. 2nd photo shows the the proper alignment of the charging port on the new device. I purchased this product for my elderly mother with macular degeneration to enable her to continue reading without carrying heavy large print books and straining her neck. In my opinion, this device is too small to be able to read in large print. In the largest font, landscape orientation, you can see only a short or partial sentence. No user manual is included with the product, not even the basics of how to get to the “library” to access the digital user manual. This may be fine for experienced users, but not for new users. The operation is NOT intuitively obvious. I searched all over to find the font setting, to finally discover it is ONLY accessible when a book is open. So for the vision challenged, it’s worthless, because all other operations use a very small font! What good does it do to have such large fonts available for reading books, if you can’t read anything else on the kindle?!

I also dislike that the cost of books is NOT displayed on the “book list” view. One has to click on each book to find the cost. There seems to be no way to search for “free books” or “Christian” books. The closest category is spiritual/religious which includes mystic and demonic books. Frustrating when you are searching for a specific type of book.

Charging port defective and can’t charge. The charging port is offset and sunken in, so the charging cord cannot be plugged into it. So, until I get a replacement, I can’t give a review. I’ll update my review after I get a replacement."
BeemerPilot,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like a rock - straight to the bottom of the hot tub. I tried the rice-in-a-ziplock trick to no avail so this is my 4th Kindle. Yes... I'm hard on my Kindles: saddlebags, camping, water, but even given the abuse they keep going with no complaints. I'm glad this is waterproof - I enjoy reading in the hot tub and even a few nights ago there was a misty rain so a large hat kept my head and cigar dry and I didn't have to be concerned about the Kindle. HINT: this is just a tad smaller than my last kindle (1/16""?) so it would slip around in the old leather cover so I just put a couple of dabs of hot glue between them and it's just fine and I saved $30. Highly recommend... my wife might get rid of her Fire."
Sylphide,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Kindle was the black one with the keyboard, which I bought in 2010. This is my fifth Kindle, and my fourth Paperwhite. I love that it is thinner and lighter than the previous version, and that it has a flat front screen without edges. Aside from that this Kindle is not much different than the previous version. I probably would not have upgraded if it had not been on sale for $84 and if I had no older model to trade in.
What I do not like about any of the Kindles I have owned, with the exception of the keyboard version, is the on/off button. On the keyboard version. this was a slide, but on the newer models it is a push button, which is located AT THE BOTTOM of the device.I store my Kindle upside down in a neoprene sleeve when I am traveling, but occasionally it gets turned on because something pressed up against it. PLEASE bring back the slider on/off button."
Leota Hartsell,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This kindle worked for about a month. I received a replacement, but the kindle started working again,I kept it and returned the replacement. now two months later, it just quit working again. Has no light, the pages will not turn .
I can not even turn it off. Very sorry reader, I would not recommend this kindle. My first kindle is still working, of course it is not a lighted kindle."
tm,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this new kindle since mine finally died after a couple years. I was excited about it being waterproofed. I never had an incidence with my old kindle, but the feature is comforting. I used my old kindle daily so when I switched to the new one, the differences were apparent.

I’m not a huge fan of the new home screen, but that’s preference. The very top brightness is not as bright as my last one though its supposed to have more lights? I couldn’t tell the difference with the new higher digital pixel count. It’s a different shape than the last one so I had to purchase a new cover as well. Since I always put a cover on my kindle, you really can’t tell any changes they make to weight.

Over all, I like it, but I wouldn’t upgrade if my last kindle didn’t die. Hopefully the battery/charging issue several models have had is fixed with this one."
Bad Hobbit,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the screen, battery life and being waterproof. Reading in full sun...just like reading from a paper book.

What I hate is the power button on the bottom. What idiot designer came up with that idea. If you set the book on something vertically while reading you can’t avoid pressing the power button. Holding it at the bottom...too easy to hit the power button. Dumb dumb. I can’t count the number of times I’m into my reading and suddenly I get prompted to shut down because the power button was being pressed and I wasn’t aware.

Also not happy that kindle on iphone has tons more SW features like scrolling instead of paging.

Another complaint, sometimes when going to the next page screen turns black for a half second. Like at end of every chapter.

Final complaint...it’s slow. They need a faster cpu."
DG,2.0 out of 5 stars,Settings exactly the same on each in pic. The screen is much dimmer than my old Kindle even trying to adjust it differently. Very disappointed.
TheSCOTTS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This latest model has taken me a little longer to get used to than normal, but I pleased with most of it.
The one thing I DON'T like is that while it will pair with Bluetooth speakers or headphones for you to listen to audio books, it won't all Text-to-Speech anymore. That's understandable when the author is selling an audio book, but it should be linked TO the book. And, more to the point for me, when I'm the writer sending a document to my kindle to have it read allowed to me for proof-reading/revision I see no reason I shouldn't be able to. But I still have my old kindle for that, so I'll make do. I just wish Amazon was more reasonable about these things..."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I spend hours everyday reading for work and my own pleasure, and have felt that my eyes now need a break from backlit screens once in a while.
So I Upgraded my Paperwhite 3d gen. for this 32 gb version, for pretty much only one reason, storage.
I use most of my tablets and readers when I don't have wifi access, so storage is a biggie for me Murphy's law being that the book I want to read is not on the device when I need it to be.
The device itself is small and light and a must for frequent travelers or anybody who loves to read for extended periods of time.
However there are some things that makes very little sense when it comes to the design, why is the power button on the bottom? this makes a cover/case a must or the device gets turned off frequently from just holding it when you read. Always keep something you can wipe the screen with because it smudges something awful. Amazon still don't offer soft/warm light [ shame on them ] and this device has one more light then the old one but is a lot less bright,
I never went over setting 12 in brightness on the old one and here I'm never below 14.
Going from a great tablet to an e reader takes some getting used to when it comes to respond times, whether it is turning pages, browsing or God forbid having to use their browser to go online, an outright awful experience.
All the commands are made from the top witch is the opposite of every tablet and app out there.
Over all this is not an instead of item but an extra goddie. I will still read regular books, read on my Samsung S2 tablet and use my laptop for web related things, But if you are a book reader invest in a reader it is so worth it, and this one is one of the best out there."
Tracey Kline,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just bought this for my elderly grandmother to listen to audio books and it wont pair to the brand new $70 Bluetooth headphones I bought with it. Tried everything even those headphones pair perfectly to my phone and iPad without issue. Checked the online forum and sure enough ... Dozens and dozens of similar complaints. None of the troubleshooting works and now suspiciously the forum is ""read only"" with no new posts accepted. Tried online tech support via Amazon which says it is available to call me and when I click to call it is also out of service and ""unavailable at this time"".. Take this piece of garbage back and shove it"
Kile,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle, so I waited to write a review until the new wore off and I had used it a few months. I still love and collect books and prefer the tactile experience of a good hardback book. The books I download to my Kindle are, with rare exceptions, the ones I would otherwise buy in paperback as entertainment to read once without adding to my library. I have also downloaded a couple of cookbooks through my Kindle Unlimited subscription to sample and determine which I want to purchase in a bound version.

I like the compact size and clarity of the screen. Whenever I travel the Kindle is always in my bag taking up less room than a bound book and it is with me whenever I face the ordeal of a waiting room. Waterproof is an important feature for me because I use my Kindle for summer reading on my boat and it has been splashed more than once. The only real gripe I have with this Kindle (not bad enough to take away a star) is the placement of the power button. Although not as often now as when I first got it, a misplaced finger or contact with whatever the Kindle is propped upon shuts it down. It's a minor irritation considering the device's overall usefulness.

In summary, I'm not cancelling my Library of America subscription or throwing out any of the classics to which I often return, but I am going to enjoy many fun reads with my Kindle."
SeattleGuy999,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I **LOVE** that I can read anywhere, not matter how bright or dim the light. I loved my original Kindle, but not being able to read in MANY light conditions was just too much!

Recommendations for improvements:

1. I should be able to read along with Audible books as you can with the Kindle app for Android (and probably iOS) and on Fire tablets. If you don't want to/can't do the text highlighting because of the way E Ink screens work, then just flip the pages as the reader moves to the next page. AT MINIMUM, let the audio continue once started and still allow me to flip to reading mode, keeping the audio playing. It's a big disappointment that the Audible experience is basically no better than an MP3 player.

2. It would be REALLY NICE to be able to pair a Bluetooth keyboard to the Kindle to make it easier to take notes. Since you've got Bluetooth hardware on the device and Bluetooth software for Fire tablets, this should be easy.

3. A USB-to-headphone adapter would be nice for those who don't want to bother with Bluetooth. I think you have one for the previous Paperwhite.

Basically, I'd like to be able to do anything I can with a Fire tablet while having the E Ink screen.

These are pretty easy to implement, and would enhance the value of the Kindle."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had an older Paperwhite for awhile now. I decided I'd like to have a new one with the thought in mind that it would be faster and have other features that I did not have on my old one. Well, it sure isn't any faster. It might even be slower to load when first opening up. Nothing about it seems much different to me, at least not anything I would use. Downloading didn't seem faster either. The advantages I do see is that the backlight is brighter and I do think the screen is a little crisper. Plus, I like the fact that it is waterproof. I was putting my old Paperwhite in a Ziplock bag whenever I was in the bath or around water which worked fine but looked a little dorky. Overall, I would not have bought it had I known it wasn't any faster and didn't have any newer helpful features. Why a device would be as slow as this thing is in this day and age is a mystery to me."
amigcoffee,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the first Paperwhite and loved it. When they came out with the 2nd generation Oasis, I ordered that, and the battery life was absolutely atrocious on it compared to what I was used to, and I really hated the uneven look of the large black section with buttons only on one side. After using it for a year anyway, I decided to turn it in to go back to the Paperwhite (now with a totally flat screen - yay!) and I see nothing wrong with this new Paperwhite. Mine is running snappy and has no pinhole lights or uneven lighting, and the light is nice and bright and white. It looks great. My one gripe, however, is what is the deal with the massive bezels on the Paperwhites? After using the Oasis I got spoiled with the larger screen and small bezels so this has been the biggest adjustment to go back to. Amazon, why, why, why can you not just make the actual screen on this larger and the bezels smaller?! The huge black frame on this is just such unnecessarily wasted space!! It would make this the #1 perfect reading device if you could just update that! Maybe think about that for the next gen Paperwhite! Anyway, that's my only critique - otherwise I'm not sorry I went back to the Paperwhite over the Oasis."
Katiebelle63,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a Kindle since the first one that came out and I love my Kindle. My Voyage developed a clear spot so I knew that its time was almost up when low and behold the gods of e-readers delivered the newly improved paperwhite just in time. Not sure about the battery life yet because I know indexing can eat up some battery but I have always been impressed with how long the batteries have lasted in the past. I am a voracious reader so I can go through a battery charge fairly quickly. It is nothing for me to read for 5 or 6 hours at at time. I expect to go through a battery fairly quickly the new paperwhite holds up well to my ""entire"" novel in one sitting reading. I am impressed, and the water-resistant thing is just a plus."
Kindle Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th Kindle - I've had 3 Paperwhites in the past decade (plus?) and one Fire 7 tablet. I do not like the changes in user interface and functionality. It takes way too many steps to access your library and pull a book to read - the main screen highlights your wish list and items for sale. Amazon is too focused on repeated selling, and makes it hard to enjoy the things I've already bought from them. I'm not an Alexa user (for security and privacy reasons) so I won't be getting any more Kindle Fires. It's frustrating that the battery starts to go (gets too hot, doesn't hold charge well, etc) that it's easier and cheaper to buy a new device than to replace the battery. I was very happy with my Fire 7, for the most part.
In addition - I really dislike the inability to move around (via slider) in the book when it's open. Again, you have to go through several steps to find that option, instead of just having it show up on the bottom of the screen. In contrast, I borrowed an iPad mini and put the Kindle app on it - works great. I'm sure there are things I can't do on it with Amazon that I could on a real Kindle, but mostly it's very easy to set up however you like."
Nick T.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Kindle to read PDFs for work, books for research, and books for pleasure. I am the type of person that rarely reads one book or article for longer than 30 minutes, at which time I need to read something else because my mind wanders. I love my Kindle paperwhite with 8GB memory, and I'll try to address why here and touch on one thing I don't like much.
Pros:
1. The built-in light is exactly what I wanted so that I can read in bed without disturbing my wife. The brightness and dimness are easy to adjust and I have not yet found it overbearing. In the daylight, the screen is still easy to read.
2. The battery life is great. I don't worry about it dying--ever. I am the type of person that plugs my electronics in nightly though. I tested it when I first received it to see how many days I could go without charing. I read with it for about two hours per day and after four days I still had about 20% remaining.
3. Moving PDFs to the kindle is relatively easy. I just email the PDF to the Kindle email address that you receive when you set the kindle up. I wish there was an effective app or upload mechanism through the Amazon site to move large numbers of PDFs over, but the email works well enough.

Cons:
1. The touch screen takes a day or so to get used to. It is not as responsive as a smartphone (that is expected), so you have to wait just a split second before navigating to the next screen."
AngelaC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got my first Kindle for Christmas, 2009 -- and it still works, though the battery dies much more quickly than it used to. When I opened up the package Christmas Day 2019 to find a brand new Kindle Paperwhite, I was thrilled! A new Kindle and one I hope will have a long, long life.

I am impressed with the thinness of the Kindle and how light weight it is -- much thinner and lighter than the first Kindle I have. I do like the built-in light; it makes reading in bed much easier. Navigation is relatively easy and page turns are seamless -- no dissolving pages, just a quickly changed page. All of that makes reading much more of a pleasure than it's been in a long time.

While I do like this version of the Kindle, I did find a couple of things a bit annoying. For one, finding the home menu is not as easy as pressing the home button that physically resides on the older Kindles. However, that is just likely a matter of getting used to the navigation. Once I get used to that, I doubt I will consider it an annoyance.

I have noticed that the battery drains more quickly than the earlier Kindle, which is likely due to the back lighting and the fact that I have the light at a medium level at all times. It lasts longer than the 2009 Kindle currently does, but it doesn't last quite as long as the 2009 Kindle did back in 2009. Again, it's a small thing, but it is one thing I noticed that made it less desirable than my original Kindle.

Overall, I would recommend this product. It's easy to use, easy to set up, has plenty of storage space, and plenty of light. If you have an older Kindle that you're thinking of upgrading, this is definitely a worthy option!"
Rick,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I own five candles I love their product but I have the 10th Generation and I must say I'm not as happy with this product as I have been in the past. My first problem is highlighting it always changes the page rather than highlight like I want and I have to go back and forth a couple times even losing my page as a result. It's also disappointing to realize that I have to charge the battery even more than any other unit I had. And finally in some books where they put in pictures of the people or maybe a sample letter to text is so small I can't even read it with a magnifying glass and it's not expandable. And last but not least when you open it up you have to sit there and wait for it to wake up before you can swipe to read your book this is not on any other Kindle that I have had, 4 paperwhites and one Kindle Fire; it sounds silly but I really don't like waiting for it to wake up."
Janet,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgrade from original PaperWhite was a good decision. Faster and more reliably responsive, a little lighter and smaller footprint with same size but sharper screen.
It would have been nice if it had Qi wireless charging since the micro-USB port is a likely point of failure.
Also, it would have been nice to have a more automated way to download books that were on the device being replaced. The only way that I found was to download each book individually; however, it did keep the place on partially read books.
Because it's exterior is smaller, it required a new cover; however, the cover is very durable and convenient.
The PaperWhite is excellent for reading in bright sunlight and in a car."
Citizen Coy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I read about a hundred reviews trying to decide which e-reader to purchase and ultimately chose the paperwhite. It arrived sooner than date given and was easy to set up. There was 55% battery life upon opening so I was able to immediately start fooling around with it and download books. Overall I am satisfied with the reader. It reads just like a book and does not strain the eyes. I increased the font size and read a whole book in less than 24 hours while still tending to responsibilities. I love how quick and easy it is to look up definitions with a simple tap of the word and just as easy to make the definition disappear.
Cons-
-I don’t like the recommendation books- I have used the settings to remove them but unless I am on my read list I still see the suggestions which is a bunch of Children’s books. I don’t even know how they came to that conclusion.
- it took a few for me to understand how to get to the main menu while in the middle of reading a book. After playing around with it I was able to figure out that you can’t tap anywhere on the screen to open main menu. You have to tap anywhere on the top of the screen to open the menu. That’s not an issue now.
- I do not like the list presented when you go to kindle unlimited. I wish that I could personalize it. The books are tailored for in my opinion white women and I am not that. Even after searching over 20 books it has not customized to similar items I search. There may be a way to change this but I have not figured it out yet.
- If you read a lot of books by black authors expect to pay. Most of them are not included in kindle unlimited. There are some but for the most part they cost especially the nonfiction books.
- there are advertisements when you first open this e-reader but it’s nothing unbearable. It’s usually for a book and a quick swipe makes it go away. I’m happy I didn’t spend the extra $20.
Other than that my only big issue is not being able to personalize it the way that I want. There is a lot of junk they have listed that I could do without because it simply doesn’t apply to me. There may be ways to enhance customization and I just haven’t figured it out yet. I am happy with my purchase for being able to carry multiple books in one small device."
Dolores,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using my kindle paperwhite gen10 for a few weeks now. It is great for reading since it is small and lightweight.
Just a few things to note...
It requires a charge every second or third day.
A few times it was just black and white stripes and I had to shut it down and wait a while. Then it worked again.
I love that you can adjust the font and size of the font to make reading easier; however, I wish you could also adjust the book icons to a larger size. The small book icons are hard for me to see."
Vin,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle Paperwhite is slower than the previous generation released in 2015. That's right, slower. You usually expect an electronics product to get faster over the years (especially four), but this one is in fact noticeably slower. I'd say like 40% slower. The battery life is also quite worse. I'm guessing they cut corners in these areas to minimize the increase in price. If you really need the new features this version brings and you can mind the tradeoffs, then okay, but otherwise this product just isn't worth it."
Steven Dean,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Paperwhite. I get it, some people would rather have a physical book. If you do, nothing will change your mind on the Kindle.

But for me, I love how I can take my books anywhere, and have a lot of them in one small device.

I used to have a Voyage, but it didn’t have enough space for a lot of books. Also, compared to this Paperwhite, the battery life was surprisingly poor. The Paperwhite lasts for about 3 weeks, for me, if I read about and hour, 5 or 6 days a week.

I bought the 32 gig version."
ThatsMrGrinch2U,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish Amazon would state in their posting of this particular Kindle that it doesn't have a warm light feature. I actually thought this was standard, but later finding out that it only exists with the Kindle Oasis. Why? All iPhone, iPads, Samsung Pads, etc. have the warm light feature. Seems like it should be a standard feature by now. Otherwise, this Kindle is feather light and seems to be fine for anyone who doesn't care about protecting their eyes or sleep patterns. Returned for a refund...and paid mucho bucks for the Oasis."
Anne Oman,2.0 out of 5 stars,Who on Earth decided to redesign the perfectly functional Paperwhite and make it far worse?? Let's see...we can move the power button to the bottom so that if it's propped on your lap/a pillow it will turn off midstream. And let's eliminate the landscape option for those who like lying on their side and reading in bed. And make it so you need to open it like a book to wake it up. Which makes no sense with coverless cases. I've taken my old one - scratches and all - back from my son and given him the new and NOT improved Paperwhite. Sheesh.
Reads-a-lot,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I read a lot. I mean a lot. Every day for at least 2 hours a day. Over 300 books a year. My Kindle is very important to me, but I'm not ready to spend the amount for an Oasis. My old Paperwhite had 3G for when internet access wasn't readily available. This one doesn't have that option and has slow and week internet connection. So, if I'm in bed and want to start a new book, I have to get up, go downstairs, download the book, and go back to bed. It seriously diminishes the utility of the reader.
The touch screen is usable, but not the most responsive.
The battery is decent. I charge mine 2 or 3 times a week.
Glare free screen is a huge plus when reading outside.
The best thing about this new Paperwhite is that it's water resistant. I can take it to the beach, the pool, read in the bathtub, without worries that I had with my old Kindle. All things considered, 3/5 stars."
Arkansas Traveler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle. I took advantage of Amazon's offer to give me credit on a trade-in, and gave them my oldest Kindle, a model that did not have a lighted screen. I prefer reading my Kindle over reading physical books, especially when we travel. I frequently read after my wife goes to bed, and it is important to be able to read without having any lights on in our hotel room. I also like being able to load my Kindle with several new books before we leave home so I don't run out of books during a trip. The new Paperwhite is enough like older models that there is no problem learning how to use new features. The introductory software that came with it makes it easy to see what is new and how to use it."
TTT Greenway,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I think I bought one of the first Kindles ever, many years ago. I also bought one of the first Paperwhites when they were introduced. My experience has always been very positive until this purchase. Bottom line, I had to return the first one of these new Kindles because it wouldn't hold its charge and would freeze frequently, necessitating a time-consuming reboot. The return and replacement process was well handled by Amazon, but although the replacement model is an improvement, it is beginning to freeze again, particularly when I search the definition of a word. My advice to Amazon is to introduce a new model when it truly is an improvement over the last model. My advice to potential purchasers is to wait if you can until Amazon introduces such an improvement."
Susan P. Henry,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Paperwhite Kindle. I managed to lose the other two.

I don’t know if they have changed anything about the workings of the Kindle when they made it waterproof, but this is my least favorite of the three I’ve owned.

It takes longer than it used to to wake up the Kindle. The touch screen is okay while changing pages, but is otherwise torture to deal with when shopping Amazon or trying to access my library.

It is so s-l-o-w and sometimes I have to continually press a button before it finally takes. I certainly hope Amazon works on that in future updates."
K. Tompkins,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded from the non-backlit 7th generation and WHAT A DIFFERENCE! I used to have to use a small camping light for night reading, which got a little tricky when I would move around and try not to wake my husband. Having upgraded, I can adjust the light from no light at all to bright enough to read in the darkest of rooms. It’s sleek and lighter than previous generations. The fact that it’s waterproof will be great in the summer time! Navigating the book store and downloads is seamless. It has a beautiful, crisp screen.

If you’re on the fence about upgrading from previous generations without the backlight, I promise you will not be disappointed. I paired it with a case with a band to slide your hand into and it makes holding the kindle a lot easier.

Price — I’m not sure if it’s because of amazon prime, but I bought it for $99 with the ability to pay for in 5 monthly payments. I paid $3.99 for overnight shipping and I had it in my hands by 3pm the next day. Totally worth it!"
Kayjenx,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned several Kindles before. My most recent was a refurbished KK.

It does what it promises to do. I can read books, with a light, that doesn't hurt my eyes. It's light , even with a cases on.

If I want to nitpick I would complain that the screen does get smuggled more easily than the KK, but not more than the Voyage. It also has a slight glare when lights shines directly on it, although that is not unique to this device. I noticed a similar thing on the KK depending on where I sat. For 95% of the time these 2 issues don't bother me.

I haven't been reading as much and have only charged this Kindle once since I got it like 2-3 weeks ago. Wireless is always on.

The waterproof feature and audible is a plus, although I might never use them, it's good to know I have it, if I ever need/want to.

I love the flush bezel because there was always some dust in the corners of my KK and Paperwhite 2. I keep this in my bag and dust would gather (it's always dusty here). This one gathers no dust, but it does fingerprints. However, these can be easily cleaned off."
Maria,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The first thing I notice is that package seemed deficient for a fragile piece of electronics, it consisted of a very thin and soft box, it came alright so I cant really complain about that. Battery life is a joke. Screen is nice, but not really glare free, as shown in the photos, even at full light level, the glare from a window can be an issue, although is easy to find and angle where you can read comfortably. The e-reader it self is quite slow, even after resetting it as suggested. My main problem with it is that its really only good to read amazon e-books, even when trying to read text only pdfs (the kind you can copy and paste, or even modify) loaded from a PC, its useless. It wont allow to do almost anything (for example adjusting font size) so you are stuck with a tiny letter size, not suitable for reading. It lets you however zoom the screen, so you can, if you prefer, constantly sweep left and right this awkward, slow responsive touch screen in other to read a complete line and save your eyes in the process. The 5$ kindle credit is a nice detail."
Walker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite after my Kindle 2 could no longer download new books. The battery life on this new Kindle is pretty amazing. It lasts for a long time. Even when the Kindle is in my desk drawer for several weeks, unused, the battery will still be 70+ % charged. With the Kindle 2, I would always have to charge it, after a few weeks on non-use. The device is very easy to read in bright light, which is why I stuck with a Kindle. The built-in light seems to work OK, though I don't do any reading in the dark, so I can't attest to how well it provides light for night reading. The screen is plenty bright, e.g. when the Sun goes behind some dark clouds. I did go into a dark closet, just to see what would happen and the screen was plenty bright to read easily. I also like the touch screen better than the buttons of my old Kindle. Never thought I would say this, but I am more comfortable with touch screens these days. Did I mention that I am nearly 80? No vision problems, just a little reluctant to change habits. The only issue that I have is that the 'off' screen is always on, though dimmed. Amazon says that it does not use battery power, but how is it possible that it stays lit then? Definitely a minor point. This is a great device at a good price. It more than meets my ebook reading needs."
Camila Garcia Enriquez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"(This is the first Kindle I've owned, so I don't have a way to establish comparisons with prior generations or different models.)

I LOVE my new Kindle and have only had good experiences with it so far, from tracking my package to setting up the reader. I decided to buy it without special offers and I am glad I did, the background images are not distracting for me as advertisements can be.

I've downloaded the books I'm currently reading and I've turned on airplane mode, since I don't really need my Kindle to continuously be on wifi or trying to connect to wifi signals when I leave home. As expected, battery life on airplane mode has been INCREDIBLE. I charged it 4 days ago for the first time and I've been reading maybe 2 hours a day. Battery is currently at 87%!! Then again, this excitement with long battery life is coming from owning a smartphone and knowing I have to pretty much charge it every night.

I love the paper white aspect of the screen, and being able to set the font size and screen brightness I want. I find the resolution to be very pleasing and have read in both a dark room (GREAT), and outdoors in the middle of the day when it's the sunniest (ALSO GREAT).

The only thing that could be a downer for some people is that the OFF button is on the bottom of the Kindle and I've accidentally turned it off while reading because of how I was holding it. (I tend to use my pinkie finger as a stand/base for it). But since I figured that out, I've just changed how I hold it. Still LOVE IT and totally recommend it."
KC of Indy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I figured I would upgrade my wife's paper-white as it was 3 yrs old. I figured after 3 yrs it would be beneficial to upgrade as technology changes so fast. WRONG. Other then the new 10th gen is water resistant, here was no benefit to upgrading her 7th gen device. Same resolution and same size. Plus I did a pre-order, 30 days later it drops $40. Disappointed in Amazon. The never ending price changes at the drop of a hat. I am quitting Amazon Prime, just too many price changes and the technology is going stale. Already switched all 5 of my Fire TV over to Roku"
STRETTEL,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m a longtime Kindle user, this being my 6th Kindle (original Kindle, have 3 kindle Fires, a Kindle e-reader, and now this)... I love this device. I read all the time, travel a good deal, and so battery life and backlight is important to me. I love the Kindle Fires, but the battery life isn’t ideal for me so I got the Kindle e-reader about a month ago... not thinking how important backlighting would be. I should have gotten the paperwhite instead, but I finally got it last week and I absolutely love it. Battery life is good. I can read in the dark now without an awkward light clipped on to my reader. The size of the device and weight is perfect. And it’s a good looking e-reader. Since I’ve pretty much had all of the Kindles that have been released (give or take a generation or two here and there), this one is the nicest because it’s lightweight and convenient for my lifestyle. I’ve never had any issues, I think Amazon makes a good solid product with the Kindle."
M. Alspach,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is probably the fifth or sixth kindle I have owned, and my least favorite of them all.

the book covers don't show on this version, active content can not be ran on this version (I loved the electronic suduko i played on my other paperwhite, it was the best suduko version i have ever found).

it may have tons of space but it is severely limited in what it can do, more so than any previous model.

best use, store tons of ebooks on it and leave it offline.

also, when you disable ads it still has a ad at the bottom of the screen, just so you know ""removing ads"" doesn't mean ""ALL"" ads.. wth.. that isn't legal is it?

the left over ad is at the bottom of the screen where you scroll to turn pages of collections in the past so you hit it repeatedly..

thanx amazon..

going to return this because of the persistent paid to be removed ads, they should return even the 22$ paid to remove the ads (they charge tax on that now) considering nothing was removed/altered at all. no regular screen savers.. just ads, STILL."
Ramsey2314,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say that hasn’t already been said? It’s a pretty great reading device. Screen is awesome. Battery life is great. Touch screen works as well as you’d expect for an e-reader. It’s waterproof...not that I think I’d ever need that option, but cool to have it. It’s lightweight, portable without being too big or small and totally comfortable to hold for hours at a time to get lost in a good book. Some people dropping ratings for the USB, but I don’t see why that’s a huge deal honestly. It only needs to be charged once every few weeks, maybe once a week if you read multiple hours daily with the brightness turned up. Not a big deal at all for me. My kindle looks awesome on the Amazon brand clothlike cover and the device it protected front and back. I’m super happy with this device and much prefer reading in this than an iPad or other type of device."
B. Haney,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this upgrading from the previous generation of Kindle Paperwhite and to me it was well worth it.

Pros:
-The screen is edge to edge so you don’t have that annoying bezel crevice where dust collects. Plus it looks much nicer this way.
-The lighting is far more even than last gen. No more noticeable shadows on the screen if you’re reading in a dark room with the backlight on.
-Not exactly a pro but battery life seems to be on par with the last generation. I think that the people complaining about this don’t realize that after you download a bunch of books (like you would do when you buy a new kindle) your kindle has to index all those books which can take several days and eats up a lot of processing power. Note, if you want to see if your kindle is still indexing just do a search from the home screen for a nonsense word like awffsff. If your results show “text in books” highlighted with a number following it that means your kindle still has to index that many books.

Con:
-The only drawback I can see with this one is that since the screen material is edge to edge it acquires a lot more fingerprints. This isn’t a very big deal and the pros far outweigh this one con."
P123,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Updating to 1 star. Poor battery life is not as bad as having problems with downloading books from the cloud to the device. Previous paperwhite had over 1200 books on it without an issue. This one has stuff on it I did not add and I can't download my library from the cloud to it.

This is the first time I've been disappointed in a kindle paperwhite purchase. This is my third one and it so sub standard to the previous ones I've had. The only reason this one was purchased was the battery charging port quit working on my other one. With the other ones the touch screen was smoother than this one. The batter life would last me at least a week on the other ones and they were connected to wifi. This one is dead over night even if I haven't been reading. I can't see it lasting long with it constantly being charged."
DC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Kindle (10) b/c it is lighter in weight. I suffer from moderate to severe arthritis in my hands and fingers, so lighter is always better.

I love the new features --- swappable home, personalized reading, the ability to return library books, % battery, and labels for toolbars.

I always - always - put screen protectors on my technology. This is no exception. I've never had issue with glare.
I also keep my Kindle in a case."
Selenity Jade (Coffee Addicts Book Reviews),5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I upgraded from an older Paperwhite to this one quite some time ago and I've been LOVING it. You can adjust the lighting if you find it a bit too bright as it is a tad different than previous models. At first, I didn't like the 'waking up' period, but I got used to it and then found out I can turn that off. It takes some more battery use if you keep it off, but that's fine with me.

I am loving the new software organization updates that the Kindles have been getting. My newer device holds more of my cloud books visible and it's faster than my older one. I only had one issue with it when I first got it and it was an easy fix, I couldn't believe it.

After I updated and registered my device, it wouldn't hold a charge. It'd be 100%, then an hour later be 5%. I went to the help center, found out I should do a restart of my device, and voila, fixed. Crazy.

All in all, I love my Kindles, and the Paperwhite has left me with nothing to complain about."
stuchols,1.0 out of 5 stars," After two defective New Kindle Paperwhites, I am so disappointed! I received my first one and after a day of using it, the screen started flashing. I contacted customer support and they sent me out a replacement. I received it the next day. As soon as I began setting it up, the screen was flashing the same way as the first one had. Every time the screen is touched, it flashes black and white. Also, the battery drains very quickly, and they are supposed to last weeks?? I’m not going to chance it a third time. I will stick with my Kindle Fire for now until Amazon can figure out what is going on with this product. Customer Support was very helpful both times I called to return the kindles. It appears others are having the same issues. Some have also posted their experience in reviews here."
SunshineNYC,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth Kindle, and I think my last one - I'm going to try another ereader instead next time. Why? Because they keep getting worse - features are taken away. My first Kindle had 3G AND WiFi. My latest - the Voyage, which I loved dearly - had haptic page turning buttons, so you could read with either hand. This paperwhite is awful. It's VERY slow to open (even though I have almost nothing on it), slow to turn pages, the touchscreen-only means that you can only read it turning pages with your right hand fingers. I find it awkward, even with a (very nice) cover). And then just the things that are increasingly annoying about the Amazon reading experience - constant ads, no easy way to organize your books, often books you own don't appear in search, the store is a mess and cluttered with self-published crap. If you're a big reader, like I am - 3 books or so a week - then seriously - TRY SOMETHING ELSE. I was excited that this is waterproof because my last Kindle was destroyed when my small child upended a waterbottle on it. Beach reading! Bath reading! But honestly, the experience is so annoying that I've returned to paper books from the library as much as possible. I don't know what's going on with the Kindle developers, but this device is miserable. I've had enough. I can't imagine buying another."
Classical Radio Programmer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Touch screen is somewhat insensitive to swipes. They did away with the buttons on the side in the previous version that allowed you to move from page to page - unfortunate choice. Typing comments or reporting errors is very sluggish. They should have an error reporting for grammatical mistakes. This version has the power button on the bottom - a TERRIBLE idea. It is all to easy to bump the button accidentally and turn it off, as others have noted. Getting a case for it helps prevent this but it's still an issue. Periodically, it freezes - swiping won't move a page. This was an occasional issue in the older version too. You need to completely reboot when that happens, and, if you've been reading for a while, it doesn't remember where you were when that happens. It goes back to the last time you turned it off, often 50 or 60 pages before that you then have to swipe through to reach your reading point."
J.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After using the new waterproof Kindle Paperwhite, here are the pros and cons comparing to the last kindle paperwhite:
Pros:
No frame: well, there is but you know what I meant. No more hair or other debris stuck in the frame.
Waterproof.
Cons:
Becomes non-responsive often: My new waterproof kindle becomes non-responsive all the time (even with full charge). I don't know what I have been doing wrong. I know I've been using it the same way as I've used last few versions of kindle paperwhites. But the latest one does die all the time.
Touch Screen: well, it is a kindle. I should not have high expectations. But the touch screen still sucks.
Battery Life: The battery life has definitely been shortened comparing to the previous kindle paperwhite. My using experiences with the same pattern that I use the kindle, I had to charge this waterproof kindle paperwhite more often than the previous paperwhite."
April garrett,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So awesome!! It was time to retire my seven year old paperwhite because the software was starting to get overwhelmed. LOVE this one. It's just a bit lighter. A little faster. It works with the internet a lot faster, which makes downloading books a breeze. Using the Libby app on my phone, I was able to sync up my library card to my kindle and it takes only a min to borrow a book from the library and then download it to my kindle. Meaning i have AN ENTIRE FREE LIBRARY at my fingertips at all times. I fly through book series so it's awesome to be able to download the next book immediately instead of having to go check out or buy the next one. The kindle itself is smooth on the face instead of the black frame being raised. That's the one big physical change that I like. It's easier to keep clean and you dont feel like theres bits of purse lint collecting in the corners."
Teemaree,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved books and was not keen on the eReader movement. The Kindle however has made me a convert. It is truly lighter than a paperback book, easier to handle, no more needing two hands or tingling arms in bed!! And it is so much nicer an experience all around. The built in light means you don’t need a lamp on when reading and it stores many books which saves me so much space at home. In the day, you could read it with no glare and it is so much easier space and weight wise when traveling. love my Kindle!

*Special tip, you can spend a little extra to not have ads."
PebblesJLPH,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love, love my original Paperwhite but this one was a complete waste of money! Although it being waterproof helps, having to plug it in every two days is a pain. I read a lot and the battery life on this device does not last at all. I returned the first one for this reason and the second one is no better. For Amazon to advertise that the battery life lasts for weeks is essentially false because it may if you never read but if you read 2-3 hours a night, it doesn't last.

Advantage is that it's lighter in weight and the light makes for better reading. I may switch over to the new Oasis but going to wait to see what people say about the battery life first. I should have listened to the reviews I read on this one about the battery life, even putting it in Airplane mode doesn't make the battery life last much longer, maybe a day longer, instead of having to plug it in every day.

I will probably get a new one when they find a way to improve the battery life like the original Kindle Paperwhite, whose battery life did last for weeks despite reading hours a day."
Leo Tohill,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The power button is on the bottom, and when I hold it in one hand, I support it on the bottom with my pinky finger, so you can guess what happens. For a while, I didn't even realize why it was shutting off during use. I called support to report a hardware problem and ask for a replacement, and they didn't suggest this cause either. Later, a web search reveals that I'm not the only one to run into this. Really, after 10 generations you'd think that they could do better. There's no reason the couldn't put the button on the top. (BTW, first-timers, the Paperwhite does not rotate, so I can't hold it upside-down.)

I do lot of highlighting and dictionary lookups while reading Spanish works. The built in Spanish-English translation dictionary is pretty good, but it is difficult to control the selection of phrases on the touchscreen. The slow response time makes it even harder. I think the device needs a more powerful processor, but maybe it's just the slow refresh rate of e-ink and nothing can be done about it.

Moving through a long list of notes (highlighted passages) is painfully slow. There's no way to jump to the bottom, as far as I can tell. 4 notes are shown at a time, so moving through 100 notes takes 25 swipes, and each swipe takes about a full second.

The text is pretty sharp, better than an LCD , but still not as good as I hoped."
Not Funny,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My three year old Kindle lasts six times as long... I read the whining about batteries and figured, whatever, maybe there was a bad batch or it needed a software update. Well this battery is evil. It drains itself and then it drains the joy of reading from you and puts you in a bad mood. I just charged you three days ago. And the software updated last week with no noticeable improvement. Not good. And there IS more glare. Not awful, but there's definitely glare. I do not recommend this device."
Dana Wolfe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m a long time Kindle owner, I have multiple Kindles including a 2007 Gen 1 and a Gen 3 Keyboard still registered and active on Amazon. My pawnshop Gen 3 Paperwhite recently died from a bad plug socket, so when the sale came up and I could get a new Paperwhite for $89 + $20 to remove ads minus my $10 Amazon credit, I bit.

So far I’ve enjoyed it. If you keep the Wi-Fi off when you are NOT downloading books, (there is no good reason to leave it on) the Bluetooth off (its off by default) and dial the backlight off when you are reading in good light, the battery life is impressive. I read three hours a day minimum, and have not had the battery go below 97%. Again, that’s with the backlight off. The backlight is bright and clear, and the 300 PPI screen is pleasing to the eye. The backlight is a little bit bluish, but I like blue so I’m fine with it.

If I had any negative things to say it would be that the new screen takes fingerprints a lot easier. If you are a heavy user expect to wipe the screen off with a damp cloth every day or two, and the fact that as a “waterproof” device it is glued together and there is no way to replace the battery without destroying the case. It will be e-waste in three years when my 2007 Kindle will still be with me and working fine. And that’s kind of sad. I hate seeing devices become disposable. One star off for planned obsolescence. Other than that. I’m happy with my purchase."
Steven Dyk,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had several Kindles, and this model has some good improvements, and one fatal flaw:
What I like:
* screen is slightly better than my previous Kindle-white model.
* I like that I don't have to worry about it getting wet.
* It took me a while, but I do now use the audio book option now. Mostly, though, I still listen to Audible on my phone.

The fatal flaw:
* Amazon has moved the power button from the top back (on my previous model) to the bottom - right where my finger rests when I am holding the Kindle when reading. The result: I keep turning off the Kindle - or rebooting it - when I am reading. This is so irritating I requested a refund. But, in researching alternative models, I realized that all the other paper-white models have the same design flaw. The Oasis has the power button out of the way, but users are reporting that battery life is dramatically shorter. So, I am keeping this model, but not at all pleased.

My recommendation is to not purchase this or any of the other Kindle paper-white models until this design flaw is fixed."
Andrew H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I debated upgrading my old Kindle Paperwhite from 2013. It was in fine working condition and I didn’t have a lot of complaints. I was, however, interested in the lighter weight and waterproofness since I like to take mine backpacking (6oz is way lighter than most print books!).

There are several other features that I see worth highlighting.

1) Turning this one on is faster and easier. No sliding button plus a finger swipe — just a simple light press at the bottom and it comes to life. Easy!

2) The lighter, thinner profile makes reading in bed on your side more comfortable. I might as well be holding a piece of paper. It’s a dream.

3) The backlighting is more even and the text is notably sharper. This won’t make a difference to most, but I appreciated the difference seeing them side by side."
Engineers Everything,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been an e-book reader for many years. I started when the best selection was actually ereader.com (since bought by B&N) and just always used my phone or tablet to read on. It was fine. However the recent paperwhite reader added enough enhancements and improvements for what is still a great price that I finally took the plunge.

I had long gotten to where I actually PREFER reading e-books to paper ones and being able to carry most of my library around with me means I've always got something to read with me. Now, with the Paperwhite reader, the enjoyment is enhanced even more. The resolution is great and even with the font at is smallest with the tightest line spacing it's pleasant to read and not dissimilar to many paperbacks. Screen redraws on page turns are quick and some functions (like dictionary and such) while present on the phone apps, they just seem to work better here.

I liked it enough that I also went and bought the B&N Glowlight 3 for me original e-reader books (and others that they have but aren't on Kindle). Sure, I went from one device to 3 but it's worth it for the improved reading experience."
Britney,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought 3 of these Dec 2018. I have had Kindles for years and years. Liked the idea of waterproof and bigger storage, so I upgraded our whole familes. It's now February, 2 months outside of warranty....and the touch screen has stopped responding. Only option is to buy a new one, another $130, minus the 15% discount I was offered because it broke. I get that it's out of warranty, but doesn't stop me from being disappointed. Basically paid $10 a month to use it, and will have to do that for another year if I want a new one."
StevieG360,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The medium gray text on the latest Kindle Paperwhite appears slightly blurry – as though there is a thin film over the screen. I thought the slightly hazy look might have been caused by fingerprints I had left when I initially registered it, so I gently cleaned the screen with a microfiber cloth - which made no difference at all. Then, I updated the software to the latest version, adjusted the backlighting and bold settings, experimented with different fonts, and even moved to different locations to change the source of external light (natural sunlight, halogen, and LED). Nothing helped.

In comparison, the text on my 8-year-old Original Kindle appears sharp and clear. I will return the Paperwhite and hope that a future version will enhance the crispness of the text."
Howard Johnson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Since the Voyage was discontinued and the battery life on my voyage was starting to fade I decided to get a new kindle. There are some noticeable differences in the performance and interface from the Voyage to Paperwhite.

1) When hitting the power button/opening the cover I noticed a now loading message at the bottom which after a little while changed to swipe to unlock. That is something I never had on the Voyage, it was always swipe to unlock right away.
2) The Library listing on the Paperwhite shows me my collections or my books. In the voyage the library showed both at the same time with the collections first.
3) Now on the plus side, the page buttons on the side are gone and I know longer can accidentally hit them and skip ahead two pages.

Overall, the Paperwhite is a good erreader, though I'll miss my Voyage (I didn't go with the Oasis due to size)."
Joshua J.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The device is great. Great reading experience, battery life, weight and size.

Room for improvement: the user interface needs some work. It'd be great to have a 1-click route to the home screen. Library organization options are lacking. The in-book location/percentage instead of page# is ridiculous. Please bring back page#s.

One of the most frustrating holes in the UI is the inability to select a publisher or imprint in the store. I know you want to push us to read certain books, including the KU garbage, but experienced readers know that one of the best methods of finding new books and authors that they might enjoy is to look at the books published by the same house as their favorite books/authors. This is a fundamental aspect of shopping for a new read, and it not being available on the Kindle Store interface is ridiculous. This just means that I now use other websites to browse potential purchases (such as the publisher/imprint websites), and search by title author. You could still put into sponsored/recommended results in the by-publisher list, but the lack of the option has driven me away from using the in-device interface for browsing purposes."
Book Dragon,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought a new kindle because my old one was going. I debated which one I was going to buy and I decided to preorder the new Kindle Paperwhite since it had all the features I wanted. The best feature for me was the light. I love the light in my kindle. What I hate is the battery life. I will take if off the charger at 100% read one book and be down to 50%. If I haven't picked it up and read it in a couple of days I get low battery need to charge. My old kindles were fine for weeks without charging. This one is nothing but charging. It is really frustrating that I am always having to put it on the charger. Even though I love the light and size of the kindle I would not buy it again with the battery life.
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The overall product is good, I guess. I purchased it for my mother who is 95, as a Christmas gift, so she could use audible and listen to books since her vision is not good. Biggest Problem: At first the Kindle White would not even recognize any of my Bluetooth headphones, Airpods, or speaker. It would only recognize ROKU for some reason. It finally connected with my Bluetooth speaker but in order to connect, I may have to try to connect 15 - 20+ times before it actually connects and I can use it. Unfortunately, when the Kindle goes to sleep it also disconnects from the speaker and no longer remembers the Bluetooth device. When I'm ready to use the device again, I have to attempt to reconnect another 15 - 20+ times. If I am in another room and wish to use my Airpods for my cellphone, the speaker to the Kindle White automatically disconnects, even though it's not connected to my Airpods. Therefore, I cannot use my Airpods at the same time my mother is using the Bluetooth speaker to listen to a book on the Kindle White. I like the Kindle on my cellphone much better."
alf,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been subscribing to my local daily paper on my Kindle for many years. When Amazon came out with the Paperwhite, I bought one (in 2014) and I've been really happy with it. Then it just quit. Couldn't get it to turn on. Charged it for six hours, but the light was still orange and still couldn't get it to turn on. So I ordered a new Paperwhite. On my old Paperwhite, my newspaper and my books all showed up together; the ones I hadn't yet read showed up under ""downloaded"" and were all easily located. On the new Paperwhite (I bought it June, 2019) my newspaper shows up in a different location. What used to take one step, now takes about ten steps to locate. It's a complete waste of time and I hate it. I did a chat to see if there was something I was missing and to see if I could go back to everything in the same location. Apparently not; this is supposedly an upgrade; a new feature. I wouldn't have ordered it if I had known. Additionally, the touch screen is so sensitive that sometimes I barely touch the screen and end up somewhere lost in the print. Then I have to try and figure out where I was, where I ended up and how to get back to what I was reading. During the chat, they suggested I ship it back and they would fix it for me (the sensitivity, not the difficulty in locating items). I don't know what they did, but now I can't tell what I've read and what I haven't read. If I just look at downloaded items, there are items shown that I know I've read and removed. Very disappointed in this version. Sorry I bought it. They suggested I could get my old Kindle fixed, but wouldn't take it back to do a repair for me. Suggested Best Buy. I'm hoping it can be repaired. Hate, hate, hate the new Kindle."
Hannah Somers,3.0 out of 5 stars,"When compared to Kindle 3, this only gets three stars from me. If one can love an object, I cherished my Kindle 3. When it died recently, after 8 years, I had 31 pages of unread books on it. This Kindle Paperwhite is at least waterproof, but the 31 pages have become 80 and the list of books is harder to read. The description of this Kindle seems to suggest that the actual screen is the same size as the Kindle 3, but it isn't. It really seems smaller. More alarmingly, it was delivered in a large box with no cushioning whatsoever, and, in a separate, smaller box, the cover and plug were delivered, with cushioning. I just hope the Kindle isn't affected by the jostling it must have received en route. But it is waterproof, though my particular Kindle is yet untested, and it can fit in even a very small pocketbook."
Frank J. Gloeckner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"On off switch is much easier to find by feel, and always responds quickly with ""swipe to open""==also very quick and certain.
To turn off same switch instantly responds to light touch.
You don't need to close a cover so that it sleeps--it will do so after inactivity. You don't really need a cover-unless you feel protection is essential.

It's waterproof--but I don't plan to test that!"
C Wartman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to admit, I still love a ""real"" book - the smell, the feel of turning a page, seeing the actual size, but for somebody who reads a lot and has not access to actual bookstores this has made me very happy. When our bookstore closed down years ago I started using my local library more often, but then I ended up with a job where my work hours are the same as the library so I ended up getting e books through them sent to my Ipad. This summer I was traveling with my mom and she had a kindle and once I held it and checked it out I realized that for reading the kindle is far superior. It is light weight and easier to hold and it is much easier to read when outside (I read a lot at the pool and beach). The Ipad is great for some things, but for reading the Kindle is my go to and I am so happy I purchased it."
Darleen Michael Baker,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd or 4th one. I've lost count. The previous, 3 year old, froze up on me and I didn't feel like doing surgery on it. Luckily Prime Day arrived in the nick of time and I now have the latest iteration of the PaperWhite. My only issue with it is the location of the power button. I've already accidentally pushed it down not once but twice and done a restart. I've learned to be careful where I set it (I use a metal wire holder at the table and if I push it too far to the right it depresses and holds the button) so that problem is solved. The screen does not appear to be nearly as bright as my old one but other than that it's fine.

It seems to be slower to wake up but at least you know it's working because it tells you it's waking up. I like that. From what I've experienced so far it's not all that different than the 3 year old PW I had. As long as I can read my books, I'm happy."
jp,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently received the Paperwhite Kindle as a gift. While exploring its features and reading some ebook samples, I quickly discovered one very irksome feature -- an annoying strobe-like flash when turning pages (black type on white momentarily changes to white type on black background, creating a weird, annoying flash). I'm new to e-readers, but figured there must be some way to deactivate this feature. So, in addition to posing the question on this review site, I also inquired with Amazon's Kindle ""Device Support"" folks, who told me the feature couldn't be turned off. I was surprised by their answer and couldn't imagine that my complaint was an isolated one, but took them at their word.

Fast forward a few weeks later when I'm reading my first e-book on the Kindle. Still finding this feature extremely annoying, I decided to do an internet search and, lo and behold, quickly found a posting about it on redd it. A very helpful poster explained that the feature involved is ""Page Refresh"" and can be turned off from the home page by clicking on the 3 dots in upper right hand corner, followed by clicking on ""Settings"", ""Reading Options"" and then turning off ""Page Refresh"". Note: despite turning it off, there is one instance where it still occurs-- on the first page of a new chapter. If there's a way to turn that one instance off, I have yet to discover it."
gfb,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had the Gen1 Paperwhite for a long time, it works great but I thought maybe I'd treat myself to a new one. It's nice and all but one big deal breaker is the new light. I read in bed at night in the dark so as not to bother my spouse. When you turn on the kindle it wakes with the backlight at blinding full brightness. This stays that way for a couple of seconds as it wakes before turning down to the setting you had it at when turning off the previous light. I'm giving serious consideration to returning this and going back to my old one."
Teeka Grishnar,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an old kindle touch that I loved. It would still be working if it hadn't gotten accidentally stepped on.
This new one? Meh. It is fussy in turning pages. It doesn't seem to be as solidly built as my old one.
I had to turn the light off completely, because it was so bright that it would suppress my body's natural melatonin, and keep me awake long after I stopped reading. Even cell phone light dims in the evening, now.
The actual size of the page is smaller than the old one, which means fewer sentences per page. The size if the device is smaller, too, and not as comfortable to hold with these new covers. The battery does not last as long, because it seems to be connected to wifi all the time. It is also difficult to find previously downloaded books.
All in all, it is not an improvement, except i got the higher storage one, but that doesn't really seem yo matter since everything has to be re-downloaded from the cloud."
MMMARTINO,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I specifically asked for this model because the technical details on their page stated the display is 6"" tall.....it is not! It's not even 5"" tall (yes, the overall dimension height is accurately portrayed as 6.6"", but the display is NOT 6"" !!!

I needed this model because my vision is not great and now I'm just going to have to deal with it or spend more money to possibly upgrade to the next model....and hope the dimensions on that model are actually accurate.

Furthermore, there are no instructions with this Kindle....you just have to stumble through it and try to figure it out. I downloaded the free sample books, but I'm starting to they are not complete books because I briefly saw something that suggested I PURCHASE them.

Oh how I miss real bookstores with real books!!!"
MD,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to have the iPad Pro 2017 model, but ended up selling it as I was hardly using it and in the spare times I did, it was for reading. I am traditionally a person who likes to physically hold the book, and collect them, but with my outgoing lifestyle that revolves around traveling for business trips this makes the most sense. If you want nice, modern ereader - get this one. I can't say any bad things about it other than the odd design to put the power button at the bottom, which I occasionally turn off.

Also, if you're someone like me who was not sure to get it with or without ""Special Offers"" - it doesn't really matter. Just think of it as a background wallpaper when your Kindle is in idle mode, you can hardly see them and honestly I picked up a few good books from them.

4/5 - minus one star for the power button-design."
Anna L Gosney,2.0 out of 5 stars,My new Kindle was a Christmas present from my husband. I have loved my old Kindle from day one. Couldn't imagine being without it. But now . . . my new Kindle Numerous times already has skipped to the end of the book when I merely tried to turn the page. Then I have the hassle of trying to find my lost place in the book. What's going on??? This is maddening. Please help. Any suggestions appreciated. This is taking all the fun out of my reading as I keep checking my location in case it happens again. Frustrated!!!
Matt Gabbard,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ""upgraded from the 4Gig version thinking ""Hey, I love my kindle, this upgrade should make it even better""... Well.. somewhat, in areas.
Double storage: Check (although did I really need it? Not really)
Waterproof: Check (again though, did I really need it?)
Easy to read in daylight: Che... (whoa! Hold on there, mister!) FAIL. The screen is NOT free from glare. Much worse then the previous version. Regardless of what the Question answer givers say, you have to hold this in the right angle to stop the glare from any above or behind light source.
WiFi and Free Cellular: C,, Nope! Unless you get the 32 gig version. It's my fault for not reading the fine print. The 8gig version does NOT come with cellular service. Read Closely.

Oh, if you have the 4gig version, and own a case for it, forget about using that case on this.. it doesn't fit. Shell out another $30,

Final Conclusion: If I had it to do over, I would have stuck to my old Paperwhite (or shelled out for the 32gig cellular)"
Ed Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An avid reader, I've always sought that touch, that kinetic connection to a book that I can wrap my soul around and sink into. A constant companion, something to tote around. A real reminder of the stories I can come back to in a minute of time here and there; or times when I can sink into my lounger and flip pages for hours. An e-reader? Not for me.

And then my beautiful darling bought me THIS for Christmas... Hmmm... and yet, it does just what I want a trusted companion to do. The feel, the just-right heft. The look of real text on a real page. And it syncs to the library - the real-deal down the street big wooden door leading to tomes of books I'll never get around to reading library. And Kindle Unlimited library; and my friends' shared e-book libraries.

And it is a chance to read where I wouldn't before - just because its so easy to have 'there' when I need it. And don't get me started on the feeling of stealth it allows for those books I just don't really need someone seeing the cover and saying, ""Oh, so I see you're reading Found & Forged, The Lost Sentinel Book 4"" (a lovely little trashy erotic novel). Please, I just want to enjoy my trash and not have to explain!

A skeptic - yes. And a convert. Thank you, babe for this gift - and thank you Amazon for the Kindle. Nicely done."
Michael Healey,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have purchased kindles directly from Amazon since they were first introduced many many years ago. In fact I still have the first two kindles I purchased one of which has an external keyboard. I have owned paper white kindles in the past. Unfortunately I dropped them and they broke.

I expected this paper white to be the best of the bunch but I have been very disappointed. It takes quite a bit of time to ""wake up"" and when it finally wakes up and I punch in my pin code it is incredibly sluggish in responding to the numbers punched. When I finally get to my book, I find that I somehow automatically turn a page without touching the screen and only touching the bezel. This is quite irritating.

One reason I especially like the E readers is that they are very convenient when taking a trip. However, when I tried to download a book from a hotel website on a recent international trip, I was unable to do so. This is due to a change made by Amazon to the new kindles apparently for security reasons. At least that is what I was told by two different Kindle representatives when I spoke with them by phone. If Amazon is truly concerned about security perhaps they could include a VPN feature with the next Kindle edition.

Additionally, the battery life on this Kindle is less then all but the earliest Kindle releases that I purchased. I read quite a bit and I still get about one weeks battery life.

One last complaint is that Kindle applications that can be used on telephones, tablets and laptops to read books allow a scrolling feature to turn pages that I like very much. Surprisingly this feature is not available on my new Kindle. I'm not sure why. Again this was confirmed by Kindle representatives I spoke with by phone.

I was going to return this Kindle but I'm hooked on E readers. It is irritating however to have to download books that I might read on a long vacation/trip at home prior to the trip rather than downloading them as I go."
oysterbooks,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I lost my first gen Paperwhite somewhere over the course of a 3-plane international flight home. I was not looking forward to paying to replace a perfectly usable item. Canceling my old Kindle and syncing the new one with my library, however, was easy and quick. Plusses: smaller, lighter, longer battery. Easier to navigate. Minuses. Some new features are useful, but not intuitive. Reviews reference problems because of the positioning of the on/off button. I have had no problems. Why the button exists, however, makes no sense to me. It's not needed. Only one issue has come up so far, after reading on my Android phone, Kindle hung up when I reopened it. Re-setting with on/off button (Google it) fixed it. Wasted my time, but I didn't lose anything. Overall--if you have an old kindle, there is no great advantage to upgrading. But if you space out and lose your kindle, you will not regret the forced upgrade."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When it worked it was reasonably good. The user interface for loading books to the device could use some significant improvements. Searching for books sometimes worked and sometimes came back empty. The screen contrast was very good and easy to read. The touch screen was slow responding. For turning pages it was fine but for other operations it was very sluggish. The size and weight were great for reading. The bluetooth pairing was very problematic. I often needed to power cycle the reader to get it to pair with my bluetooth speaker. I use the bluetooth speaker with other devices, like my phone and tablet, and it pairs quite easily so I believe it is the reader that is the issue with the pairing. The worst issue was the reader would hang and require holding the power button for 40sec to completely restart the reading. Then after less than a month the reading would no longer reset. It simply displayed a battery with an '!' symbol on the screen. I'm returning the reader for a refund. Having it die after less than a month is what earned a 1 star rating. I might have given it a 2 or many 3 star rating otherwise."
VeHer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my kindle for about 3 months now. I am extremely happy with this purchase for a number of reasons:
1. The screen is easy on the eyes and often I forget I’m reading from a tablet.
2. The size is absolutely perfect, it fits in my purse with ease! I take it everywhere.
3. It’s lightweight.
4. The battery life is awesome!!! If I’m reading regularly I get close to a couple of weeks out of it. If I read less, it goes for 3+ weeks.
The down side is the reason I cannot give this a 5 star review.
- The screen lag can be very annoying at times. I keep a lock code and it takes a few seconds to catch up. When I go between my book and the home page there is also a lag. This becomes irritating if I put the kindle down to do something and it goes into sleep mode before I get back to it.
All in all, this was a fantastic buy! I’m very happy with it!"
John,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The product itself it very solid. I absolutely love it. But the customer service element was horrendous and made me question Amazon.

My old Paperwhite (had it for four years) died suddenly. I contacted customer service to see if they could do anything, even if it was out of warranty: they gave me 15% off. I waited, since I knew Amazon has better discounts occasionally. A few weeks later the Kindles were nearly 30% off; I could not order it since I was at work, and the next day the discount was over. I contacted customer service again asking if they could honor it--less than 24 hours later--and not only did the rep say no, but he asked me to check my gift card balance (I get Amazon gift cards from work) and told me pointedly that I could just ""pay full price for a regular Kindle."" Insulted, I closed the chat.

Eventually--lo and behold--the Kindles were all on sale for nearly 40% off. I got one then.

Thus, the Kindle is an amazing product. But Amazon's customer service, or rather lack thereof (and especially saying to ""just spend full price if I have the ability,"" rather than be thrifty), made me question whether I really wanted a Kindle."
Mike from Wyckoff NJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My purchase at $85 during Amazon Prime Days made this a great investment. I now am reading much more than I used to because it is so convenient to use and take with me anywhere. It is easy to use; does not require a long learning curve to become comfortable with it. I can read in bed at night to help me fall asleep now instead of watching TV like I used to do before. The screen seems to be easy on the eyes and I do not believe it affects my ability to fall asleep after using the unit in bed. I am very happy with it. Books are easy to download from my Kindle library. I have more storage than I think I will ever need. The only negative I have discovered so far is that the battery does not seem to last as long as Amazon claims it should before it needs a charge. But it still lasts a long time and it charges fast when the need arises. To be honest I finally took the plunge to buy it because of the special pricing - I am almost certain that I would not have bought it at its current full price of $130. I am sure Amazon will have more ""sale"" prices on it over the next 4 months of the year so, if you are like me, you may opt to wait. But if time is of the essence you will not be disappointed if you pay current full price."
Author Keeb Knight,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes! So far so good! I received this Kindle Paperwhite as a gift on Christmas! I have been using it ever since. Battery life is excellent. I highly recommend keeping the Paperwhite in ""Airplane"" mode when your using to read. I charged it to 100% on Christmas day and to this date as I write this review it has only gone down to 83% and I have yet to charge it (that's approximately 2 1/2 weeks. My point is you do not have to leave the WiFi on while you're reading. You only need the WiFi for downloading your book of choice or if search for a book to buy or borrow from the lending library. Turn it off and enjoy a long lasting battery life.

Turning pages: No problems here either (tap right side of the screen to go forward. Tap the left side to go backward) Yes, it is a bit sensitive and you may touch your screen in error causing it to turn a page, but it's something that's going to happen. It's a small device.

Backlight: The backlight could be brighter at higher settings. I have it set to 21 (max is 24) which is good and easy on the eyes, but I think the level of brightness I have it set to now should have hit at about say, 15 (not 21).

Magazines: I love the fact that I can read magazines on the Paperwhite. Now I don't have to switch over to my Kindle Fire if don't want to. Only if I need to specifically see things in color then I'll switch to the Fire.

I'm currently reading through my book, ""The 86th Floor"" (well skimming reading it. I wrote it so you know.). Nice to see how your own book looks to your audience though a Kindle device). I'm also reading Kiplinger's financial magazine and a book titled ""Making It In the Forex Market"" by Andres E. Pedraza. All of the aforementioned read well via the Kindle Paperwhite.

Overall I'm very satisfied with this output by Amazon. If I come across anything that will cause me to change my star rating I'll surely update this review.

Happy Reading!"
Mrs. S,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I so wanted to like this. But oh how horrible the battery life is. Won't even go a day without completely depleting the battery.

Edited...An Amazon customer service rep. reached out to me almost immediately after writing the review without me even calling them...wow!

She apologized for the Kindle Paperwhite I received and said I surely must have received a defective one and is sending a replacement out!

I will again edit this review after I receive that one as to the battery life

Thank you Amazon!!"
JOSEPH F.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I switched to the Paperwhite from Fire 7 for the purpose of having a smaller, more compact and light weight reader. With the Fire I am able to set the page at a much brighter setting so the text is crisp and clear. The Paperwhite has a more natural look and therefore not as bright even at the highest brightness setting. Also, touch screen is not the most sensitive and I often have to swipe more than once to change the page. Otherwise, the device serves it's intended purpose and fits neatly into a coat pocket."
KarBair,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is absolutely perfect! I've been needing a replacement for my old one from when the Kindle was first released (I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did). My husband got this one for me for Christmas. I don't understand the complaints about the screen at all. I don't see any more shine to it than the original Kindles had. The back light it bright and can be adjusted to your liking. I frequently read at work in my well-lit office and turn it all the way down so it looks more like the original Kindle screens. Navigating it is a little strange compared to the old ones but it isn't anything that can't be learned. Considering it's a new model it's to be expected. The ability to surf the internet and purchase books on the Kindle is still available; which is nice is you read samples and want to purchase the book or want to purchase a sequel. I love that the font style and size can be adjusted to your liking and you can save different settings as a theme in case you share your Kindle. The size is almost exactly the same as the older models so there wasn't anything new to get used to in that area.

Overall, this is a great new version. I haven't dared test the ""water-proof"" feature yet and hopefully won't need to. I take this one everywhere with me just like I did my old one. I would highly recommend this for bibliophiles who wish they could carry thousands of books with them everywhere."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Noticeably worse than the old kindle I was replacing, what a disappointment. I held up both to my wife and asked which was easier to read (she had no idea which was which) and she picked my old Kindle in about 2 seconds. I shuffled them, same result. I did the same test to myself a dozen times and picked my old Kindle every time. Put the new one straight back into the box, will return it tomorrow. Why would you release a product inferior to previous versions?"
John D. Rennell,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If I could give this a lower rating I would. I used one of the original Paperwhites for years. Then due to a software ""upgrade"" it would no longer connect wirelessly to my ViaSat router which has been working flawlessly with seven other devices.
After burning through an hour and a half with their tech support they convinced me it had reached the end of it's useful life and I should buy a new one, so I did.
A month later the new one exhibited then same problem and after an hour and a half with their tech support upgrading software and trying again and again to delete and reregister the device I finally discovered on my own that both Kindles would connect with my internet data from my Verizon iPhone but neither would connect with ViaSat.
The good folks at Amazon are clueless as to this major deficiency with one of their mainline products so I give it zero stars."
Shayne S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this Kindle. I had the previous model and ended up gifting that one and upgrading! I love the new audible feature as well as the waterproofing. While I don't submerge it, its nice to read in the bath or pool without thinking about it. The new kindle has an impressive battery life that Ive come to expect with Kindle products and all the remaining features seem the same. I cannot recommend this product enough! I love reading and love travel and this is the answer to those problems. I had originally thought that I would miss the feel of a book, but buying this doesn't mean you will never read a real book again... I pick and choose the ones id like to read but this has made reading while backpacking or traveling without the added weight of the books. Slips conveniently into small pockets and feels great in my hands. I could honestly go on and on about how incredible this product is, but if you're on the fence... take the plunge. You will not be disappointed."
Kelly,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I mostly used this for reading on-the-go, it was lightweight and extremely portable. I found the battery life often lasted me for months at a time since I was only an occasional reader. Unfortunately, I went to charge it when I noticed the battery was at 10%, unplugged it the next morning and never realized it had not charged. I picked it up a few days later and the empty battery with the exclamation point was showing. Tried plugging it in to charge it, the charging indicator light never lit up. Waited, tried a few different chargers thinking the charger died... nothing. Can't get it to charge. I look up support for the device, apparently it only had a worry-free 1 year warranty instead of the usual 2 year since it is touted as ""water proof"" (which I never actually tested). So now I have yet another expensive paperweight and no e-reader. I used this so little that I cannot believe it no longer works. I would not recommend."
Lily,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I ""upgraded"" from my last Paperwhite because of the lure of the extra storage space. However, this one freezes a lot more than my older paperwhite, and I have only loaded 600 books onto it so far, so that extra internal storage does not seem that usable if I can't get the benefit of it on account of constant freezing.

Also, the restart button on the bottom is constantly being triggered when I stand this kindle up on a treadmill stand at the gym. Every time I go to put the kindle on the treadmill or elliptical stand, something about the contact of the bottom of the kindle to the rubber no-slip stand makes this kindle restart. Never happened with my older paperwhite, and seems to be a design flaw.

This is still a decent ereader, but given my expectations, it is disappointing."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have bought a Kindle Fire 7 a few years ago and unfortunately the memory on it has gotten full. I just got my Kindle Paperwhite this week and I love the feel and how easy it responds to my touch. Flawless and lightweight. I haven't had to charge it yet which is mindblowing. It's just an ereader not a tablet.
islam ahmad,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had really high hopes for this kindle
ihad the previous edition (the one that the screen is not flat with the body)
and read about this one that it has bluetooth and the screen is flat with the body level, which intrigued me
my experience with the device is horrible
the device battery runs out quickly over night, I lost 12% over one night while sleeping (never happened before)
you cannot read and listen (which would have been a great feature)
bluetooth keeps disconnecting while I'm holding it, it's not like I'm even getting 3 feet away from it
boot time is horrible
wifi connection is slow
downloading even kindle books (usually in 100s KBs) takes ages, even on a 40MBps connection (yes MB not Mb)
overall, very unsatisfactory design, I'm going to give it another week, and if not, I will return it"
Curiouswriter,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst experience with a Kindle I’ve had. The battery was not holding a charge for more than two days and Amazon tech support had me do a factory reset. I was instructed to charge it for three hours and “see how that works”. If no change, call back tell them I’ve done a factory reset and they would replace it. So a couple days later I called back and explained the situation of two days ago. This customer service person sent my problem to the technical support group and a day later sent me an email with a bunch factors effecting battery life that did not apply to me. Which I had told the man on the phone. Since I felt underserved and ignored by Amazon I sent their malfunctioning kindle back to them. I’ll probably never buy another Kindle after this ridiculous experience. Outsourcing customer service was the worst thing Amazon could have done."
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite being advertised as an e-reader that can be used with audiobooks, you can NOT share audiobooks via freetime account on this device. This means if you want your kid to listen to one of your audible books, it has to be under your account and not theirs - thus losing your control of their access to your library. This seems a ridiculous limitation on this device since freetime allows you to control both audio and ebook access on fire tablets. Since we bought this primarily for my daughter because if the added audiobook feature, it's worthless to us now and we will return."
GypsyGirl,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned my first new generation waterproof Kindle because of an annoying blink (black and white blink with each page turn). They sent me a new (although I think it is supposedly refurbished) one within days of my returning the other new one. This second one does the same blinking, but even MORE! It is so annoying. I may try for one more because I would really like a waterproof one for my pool this summer... but the blinking is annoying and I know I will get a headache if I continue reading from this."
Mary Agee,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this device for Christmas. I have had the Kindle for less than two months. I did not use the device for a full week, and when I went to try and use it, it was completely dead. Charging it, attempting to restart it, nothing helped. The battery was completely dead. I get it, sometimes batteries are no good, and I would not be upset by that if that was all that happened. Here is my issue:

I contacted product support via instant message chat. I had to tell the employee 4 different times that the device would not turn on as he kept giving me instructions that involved a device that turned on. Such as get the serial number from the settings page on the Kindle. I eventually told the employee that the battery was clearly dead. He told me they would send me a replacement device, and I asked if it would be a new device or a refurbished device. He told me new. Two days later, I received a REFURBISHED device.

This time I called and spoke to the product support. They apologized about the refurbished device and assured me they were sending a new device to replace my Kindle. Two days after that, I received YET ANOTHER REFURBISHED DEVICE. At this point, I just want my money back. The two times I have contacted them were not short encounters.

Long story short, don't expect a replacement Kindle in the same new condition you purchased the original!"
Scott,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle, I purchased it finally because of two specific features, the back light and it is waterproof. It has not been a disappointment, I'm reading about a book a week these days. My only complaint is the Kindle interface, I just think it's pretty crappy. This is not related to this device, it's the software design for how you interact with it regardless of the device. It is clunky and could be so much better. One problem is that I'm constantly clicking on a new book by accident when I was trying to go to the next page. You also have to start reading a book to be able to see the details of the book, like how long it takes to read. And if you don't remove your books from the device, there is an endless list instead of more intelligent ways. However, I love the Paperwhite."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is garbage. It reminds me of the kindle I had in 2012. Every single “feature” on it is worse: the pages are slow to turn and sometimes jump so that I’m confused about where I’m at. The layout doesn’t make sense and the carousel is gone. The navigation is awful. I just wasted $85+ and it’s really irritating.
David Mike,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth kindle. In two of the last three there has been a spot on the kindle that eventually develops that blanks out the writing. It could be my fault one hundred percent but I do not remember any event that could have caused that to happen. It is very small and may block out one letter but the kindle still works and I can read it.
I carry my kindle everywhere I go and would be lost without it. The last kindle I had disappeared. You have to understand I use the Kindle probably close to twenty hours a week and it is the best reading tool I every had. I have become addicted to the kindle. My children originally gave me my first kindle as a present. I could not find all the books of one author although my library search the country to find them. This author had his publishing company in England although he was an American writer. I think today I read more books being published by authors."
Dillon Ameigh,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I previously had the old Kindle Touch from 2011. It's still works great. I decided to treat myself to an upgrade, mainly for a fresh battery and a backlight.

I don't know why I bothered.

For one, the included charging cable didn't even fit in the device. Reading other reviews, this seems like a known issue. What a joke. I managed to fit another cable in just fine, but this really shouldn't be a problem the first place.

I got the device set up and added about 8 books and a magazine. I turned off WiFi and Bluetooth. I set the brightness to a low level and put the device to sleep.

The next morning I had lost about 7% battery life. I fully charged the device that day, thinking that maybe the battery just needed a charge.

Nope. Same problem after charging. I watched the charge drop by 4% in the space of about 15 minutes after that. I wasn't even reading, just adjusting the settings.

The battery life on my 7 year old Kindle Touch still holds up better than this. Buyer beware, Amazon seems to have really dropped the ball. It's pathetic."
Steph,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit 4/10/20 - came back to give it one star to see I already had. I thought I gave it two. It resets ALL THE TIME. Almost every time I try to use it. Makes it so irritating to use. Hate this Kindle, wish they still made the Voyage

It’s not worth the high price tag. I had the Voyage and loved it. But it’s old now and they discontinued it so I bought the new paperwhite.

It was a mistake, and I’m glad I also bought the really cheap kindle so I have something to read when the paperwhite freaks out and freezes, the resets itself two or three times in a row and then restarts itself, thereby both kicking me out of my book and losing my most recently read page. It usually takes maybe 5 to 10 minutes to cycle through the malfunction and get back to a useable state, then I have to find my book, open it back up, and swipe thorough until I get back to the page I was on.

It’s so difficult to use because of this basic instability that half the time I don’t bother and just read the cheap kindle. The only reason I do go back to it once it decides to reset is because of the much sharper screen resolution.

I wouldn’t waste the money on it if I’d known how awful it’d be ahead of the purchase, but I already have it and may as well use it if possible."
chris,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First: This is an easy-to-read device in nearly any light. In that respect, it is quite nice and probably good enough to make nearly anyone happy. The screen is easy to read with adjustable fonts and sizes. The dictionary and lookup features is nice if you have wifi. “X-ray” is sometimes useful but mostly fluff.

Where this falls short is:
1. Speed of response. Often, you aren’t sure if it registered your touch on the screen
2. USB micro port. These are dismal to use. USB-C is much easier since you never guess wrong on which way to insert. I have to ask though, why USB at all? It’s only for charging. Let’s go Qi wireless charging here and make the Kindle a sealed device and much more waterproof.
3. Which brings me to waterproof. It talks about waterproof but then they go to pains to tell you not to submerge the Kindle or really do much more than sprinkle it with liquids. I don’t plan to read which scuba diving, but I don’t want to worry about the kids tipping me over in the pool either. My Apple Watch can take a trip to the pool bottom, so should this.
4. The power button is annoying. Why must it be proud of the body? If it didn’t stick out, I could rest the device on the flat bottom without accidentally turning off the Kindle.
5. No way to find a missing Kindle. If you misplace it within your home, good luck finding it. If you leave it at Starbucks, no one knows how to contact you and you can’t find it. Probably want to get a sticker that has your phone number on it and hope (even though it is useless to anyone else if you call it stolen on Amazon’s site).
6. Not very easy to organize your collection of books. It insists on showing you books in a limited sorting with inflexible collections."
Gilles Mbo,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been reading books from my phone (Galaxy S7) for years now then decided that This device would be great since it it supposed to be work well with amazon books. I was greatly disappointed at the speed of this device. Turns pages VERY slowly...touch screen not working often and often had to just shut it off.
After struggling with it about 2 weeks, I went back to my phone. And it is just sitting on my desk.
My spouse uses it from time to time and she is not very interested in it.
Also I strongly dislike the advertisement that is constantly on when device not use... Featured books have nothing to do with my type of reading. They are like night and day, the books advertised and the books I read.
I know other people like their devices but this really did not work for me."
Fiat Girl,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Feeling very sad and annoyed that I traded in my “Voyage” reader for the latest paperwhite 10th generation. I only traded because of the Bluetooth feature...which I obviously didn’t know enough about because I assumed I could load music to listen to....I can’t. You can ONLY listen to Audible books via Bluetooth if you pay the extra fee.

Really kicking myself for not doing enough research before ordering.

Follow-up...
After now having my new paper white for a few weeks here are my thoughts. The battery life sucks and I wish to the high Heavens that I had kept my Voyager! 😡"
Katrina,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant to get a new, but after using it for some days, l love it. I love that l can read books using audible. I have a hectic life, and its good l can listen books meanwhile l do other things including going to the gym or walk. However, l have an observation in battery life. It does not long last as previous models. I used to have the granite kindle and l could use it for around 30 days. This one If l use continuously l have to charge about every two days. It only works with Bluetooth headsets also which l think it will be beneficial to allow to use the headphones that are not Bluetooth in case of long travels you want to have both options."
kznailz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have read many of the reviews complaining of battery storage length (time between charges) and the location of the power button but I really don't see what all the fuss is about. My new kindle seems to hold a charge for plenty of time and because I never use my device without a cover I haven't had any issues with the power button.
I haven't needed to charge it other than when it first arrived but I didn't have any trouble connecting the power cord. I'll update this post if any of the above issues appear. All that said, I really don't seem any improvements either between my older paperwhite and this one. The size is identlical and i can't read all the books I already have. I bought this version because I do read out by the pool alot and I always worry the kindle will get lost and I'll be out of a reader."
Raedeezy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall super helpful for my eye issues to be able to read in dark mode and have nice clear text and not have to worry about flare. It’s super light but wish it was a little bigger.

Two complaints: 1-To go back a page you have to really touch the edge of the left side whereas to find forward you can almost touch anywhere on the screen. About 50% of the time when I’m trying to back the page actually jumps forward and it takes a second to realize it each time. It’s annoying.
2-I have visibility issues so I have to do most reading, for fun or otherwise on a device where I can make the font huge. Therefore I take a lot of notes and the typing interface is weak. I consistently touch the wrong letter even though the keyboard is quite spacious and there’s not autocorrect so I have to go back and fix every mistake manually."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Last week I was lying on the sofa reading my Kindle Paperwhite 7th gen, I set it aside for a moment and it fell, landing face down on the (thick) rug. It wasn't even 2' but when I picked it up, it was totally unresponsive. What to do? I ordered the 10th gen. While waiting for the new Kindle (one whole day!) I loaded my current book onto my old keyboard model and read with the lamp on.

Pros: The new model is even lighter weight than my 7th gen, by almost and ounce. The frame is now bezel-less.

Cons: The shut-off button on this reader is very sensitive and easily turned off my mistake. While this isn't a deal breaker, it is a bit annoying. It may only be this one unit.

I've been reading with Kindle since June 2011. I'm definitely a committed Kindle customer."
Cady,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my Kindle Paperwhite. How can you get better than waterproof and a battery that lasts for weeks?? I'm never worried about the battery, it's great! And if you're like me, you'll wonder why pay more for a black and white ereader when you can buy the kindle fire 7 for $50? Well, the battery for one, obviously, and the waterproofing, but also distraction free reading! It's just like reading from a book, there's hardly any glare at all, so you can read outside. I have, many times, with no issue!

My only complaints are that the touch screen is a little slow, but honestly, it's hardly a deal breaker. It's not all that annoying, really. And as a student, I highlight and write notes on it a lot, it's still fine. The other grievance would be that it IS black and white and I wish it could be in color, but alas, that's where digital ink is at right now. That's not a kindle problem, it's the tech.

Anyway, I highly recommend this product, and to students as well! Read assigned reading pool-side, or in the jacuzzi! Or even in a bubble bath! What could be better?? Haha.

Oh, also to parent students as well. My toddler won't let me read any physical books, he takes them and won't give them back without throwing a fit. But he sees that my kindle paperwhite is ""boring"" and leaves me alone when I'm using it.

5 stars!"
Claudia Griffing,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the Kindle very much. I have had a Nook since the 1st edition, and I didn't think I would ever get a kindle, too. Then I found out that Amazon carries some ebooks that B&N doesn't-so I thought I would just get the app for my tablet. If you read a lot the backlight of computers and tablets starts to hurt your eyes and give you a headache. There were 2 things that sealed the deal for me: #1- 32gb of storage(woo-hoo! I am a rereader-I love new books, but I love to reread old favorites, too. I never know what I'll be in the mood for, so having the space to have hundreds of books fully downloaded makes me ecstatic!) & #2- Waterproof (such an awesome idea- like to relax in a hot bath with a glass of wine and a good book? No problem!) As far as I can tell, there is only 1 down side- the ads. Irritating, but they are only on your wallpaper and the bottom of your home page. All in all, I love having both ereaders!"
Kaymae,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll be honest... I'm a ""feel the heft of the book in my hand"" kinda gal. I've had a Kindle before, albeit literally the first model they ever made (yes, I'm that old! Back off! :)) I didn't think I'd like this one bit. I thought I'd use it very sparingly, only when I had the immediate need of the next book in a series and zero desire to head out to the bookstore in my pajamas. And I'll admit defeat, I was oh so incredibly wrong. I use it all the time, love it, carry it with me everywhere. I'm woman enough to admit I was wrong, ok?! I do still go back and forth between this and the real thing, but I've grown to appreciate the accessibility and ease of use of this particular model. Highly recommend for the avid (and even picky) reader, but grab it when they're running a special with freebies. You won't regret it."
Auryon Blue,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really on the fence for a while about getting a Kindle. My first foray into Kindles were 7 years ago, when the Fire came out - it was wonderful for reading comics and books. Albeit a bit heavy, I enjoyed reading again, undisturbed by notifications that I would frequently get on my phone. My only gripe was trying to read in the sunlight. Fast forward time & I ended up with various iPads. While I enjoyed reading still, notifications would still distract me & I found those devices too heavy & cumbersome to deal with. This year during Prime Day, I spotted the deal & figured it was too good to pass up. This is my first Paperwhite & despite lacking color, it makes up for that with size, weight, & charm. I find myself reading more these days, everywhere in fact - while waiting in long lines, in bed, at the doctor's office... basically any chance I get. It's easy on the eyes & small enough to fit in my purse. I chose the wifi only version, 8GB, with special offers (they're not intrusive), & couldn't be happier with my purchase."
Susan Snider,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I spent several weeks researching a Kindle reader to replace my 2nd Generation Kindle. Finally, I chose the Waterproof Paperwhite. It was a grand decision. The wireless makes it easy to buy books or check them out from the library. I borrow a book wirelessly from the Libby app on my tablet and then the book is sent to my Kindle Paperwhite. Buying from the Kindle Paperwhite is easy too! The Kindle Paperwhite is so small and light it has become my constant companion on the sofa. This e reader gets all 5 stars from me!"
Sandra A Morawski,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the noticeable wight difference. Several things ar extremely disappointing though.. the wake up time is measurable degraded, have to push start and then wait before swiping to open, dont understand why advanced version should take longer to open. Most irritating is that with new casing the on off button is too easily, inadvertently triggered. One of my main motivations for this device is reading in bed and i am often either one handedly reading or propping it on a pillow to read myself to sleep. With my previous paperwhite i never accidentantly turned the device off. Now i am frequently cursing my fate as i turn off the device when all i wanted to do was turn the page. The on off should either be more recessed or require a firmer hand in turning the device off. This happens multiple times every day. I upgraded for the vision of reading in The tub or the beach without worry of dampness, neither of which i have had the pleasure of testing. I may go back to my old one for the inconvenience of the things i do everyday which seem to trigger the off switch. We"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first experience with Kindle. Although at first I was hesitant about the somewhat small size (6""), it has now grown on me. I still cannot believe that the screen is on all the time and the battery lasts so long. Even the screensaver looks so beautiful. It truly does look like paper. The ability to read free books using Prime membership is a giant plus. What a wonderful technology! One gotcha. You have to watch out when scouting books. Often you are tempted to click ""read for free"" type of offers, only to find that clicking in will sign you up for extra subscriptions, something that seems a hassle to have to remember to cancel."
Upland Hunter and Dog Trainer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m disappointed because I was under the impression that this Paperwhite had built in cellular connection to Amazon. It doesn’t. You have to be able to connect to a WiFi somewhere. Sometimes I’m where that is inconvenient and miss that function! Also, the library is not as convenient as my old Paperwhite. I have to make several changes of the screen to see what books I have. The touch screen to change pages is overly sensitive. I like to run my finger or thumb along the edge, as I learned while speed reading, and this Paperwhite reads my finger as wanting to change the page (on both sides of the screen) (forward pages as well as previous pages). It is thinner than my old one and lighter, but, I’m not quite as happy with this one. My old one still works. I’m undecided if I will use it. I probably will take it with me on trips when I don’t know if I’ll have WiFi. Inconvenient!"
Daphnis 176,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have enjoyed a previous Paperwhite version for years: non-reflective screen, compact size, light weight, exceptional battery life. My main reason for “upgrading” was the new color-reversal feature. I often read in bed before drifting off to sleep, and the black background option means that there is less light being emitted into the room to disturb my wife — and less light on my tired eyeballs to keep me awake. This was a feature on the iPad’s Kindle app a long time ago; now it is great to finally have it on the much smaller Paperwhite as well. Perhaps they can improve the contrast on future versions so that the brightness does not need to be turned up so high. Even as is, it is already preferable to a white background for night-time reading. Enabling this option is not immediately obvious: look under Settings -> All Settings -> Accessibility -> Invert Black and White."
margarit martinez,1.0 out of 5 stars,It stopped working after a few days
Joe S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing. It goes with me pretty much everywhere I go. I initially had the previous generation, but due to battery issues traded it in to upgrade to this and I must say, I am a fan of the minor changes. The flush screen is super nice, as now dirt and fuzz won't get trapped around the screen. I have not put the water resistance to the test but other reviews have said that it works fine. Battery life is great, I very rarely need to charge it. And it's able to hold MANY books, all the ones I've purchased and many more. The built-in backlight is also a huge bonus and well worth the price (especially when they're discounted!!!) over the base model kindle. Overall, no regrets here at all.

I have read other reviews about bright spots or battery issues, seems like that's relatively infrequent though as I was worried about the same when I got it, and have not noticed either of those being an issue."
Michael N. Powell,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m disappointed. The additional memory is certainly appreciated as I was running out of room on my original Paperwhite. However, when I downloaded my library to the new device the transfer was not without issues. The covers for the majority of the books in my library were not transferred, and the order of my purchasing of the works was at best haphazard. I ended up calling the help line, and it was clear the gentleman I talked to was aware of the problem but not really clear as to how to repair it. Others have noted these issues in separate posts. As of today, approximately one third of my 400 plus novels do not have covers; about half indicate they have not been read when they have; and regardless of how I sort the titles the device does not place them in proper order. My original Paperwhite remains perfect with regard to these issues. I’m disappointed with Amazon and their help line - I expect more than I have so far received."
Wendy Dougherty,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very disappointed and upset with this Kindle. for the last three years I have been doing battle with my old Kindle
(a lemon) so I decided to buy a new one. this new one does all the same nasty things that my old one did.
1. Doesn't keep your place when you put the Kindle down.
2. Continuously changes the font to lower or sometimes higher size.
3. Most of the time I have hilights (grey) over sentences or complete pages. I contacted you about Kindle 3 ( the old one) and after being on the phone for 2 hours nothing was resolved. I am so upset and I would like you to replace this Kindle No.4 with a working one or refund my money (nb the new one is still showing as Kindle 3, I manually send books to No. 4. I will say my Husband has Kindle 5 and he is not having any problems and my original Kindles I did not have problems then. I do enjoy my Kindle but am very frustrated and disappointed. Please call me. 772 337 0923. Wendy Dougherty"
J. Wilcox,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I read probably 5 or 6 books a month and give my Kindles a good workout. My new 10th Generation Paperwhite is almost everything I expected of it. I bought it to keep in the bedroom while I use my 3rd Gen Paperwhite and keyboard Kindle for use in other places. It's waterproof, has a nice bright screen, sharp text, it's very light and has plenty of storage space. However, the battery life isn't as good as my 3rd Gen Paperwhite of which is also an excellent reader of which I have no complaints. The biggest complaint I have with the 10th Gen is the power button. When I hold the reader in my right hand at the lower right corner, I'm constantly pressing the power button and turning the reader off. I really wish it had a slide-switch like on my old keyboard Kindle. As old as it is, the slide switch has never failed, so I don't know why Amazon would've replaced it with a push button. At least, they could've inset the push button so you don't accidentally activate it. Other than that, I love my 10th Gen and all my Kindle readers."
TyroneBihguums,5.0 out of 5 stars,"honestly one of the greatest purchases I ever made. I had some idea of what this can do, but it exceeded my expectations by a long shot.

I’ve always been that guy, “I prefer a physical book over an e reader” but honestly I’m addicted to this kindle more. I read a hella lot more because of it.
I’m always always on my phone and this device has easily cured that distraction.
It’s a great reading experience, I bought on sale $80. Worth it. $129 a little steep tbh.

The display feels so goooooooooooooooood. Cot dammmn. It’s hella light and hella comforting on my eyes. I love how you can put PDFs on this.
As you can see in one of my photos, I have a school book and while you can’t change the font size without ruining the format it’s still better than a paperback version.

The only negative thing I have about this is a warm light at night would be rad af, but it’s still cool without tbh. Just being a first world nit picker.

Oh and you get ADs for buying this device, that was my biggest pet peeve ever. Spend all that money to have ADs shoved in your face. Holy hell does it make a game changer when they are turned off, the device speed improves on boot up a hella lot.

Pros:
The weight
The size
Touch screen
The accessibility
Battery life- like 1 weeks worth on a charge but I get about 1 1/2 weeks sometimes 2 weeks depending on reading time.
you get amazon credit to purchase a book, I think it was like 5-10$ so I picked up a book for free. So that’s hella rad.
You get to rent out 1 book every month for free that’s on their library list. Like 20,000 + books.
Not sure what else to say, but buy it, you’re reading experience will change.

If anything can be improved it would be rad to have the bezels a lot thinner, not distracting but I’d like to see more of it reduce. That would be gnarly."
Kris13,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this to replace an old kindle (1st generation) so I could rent ebooks from the library. Spent a little while deciding on which reader to get and with a toddler decided the waterproof paperwhite was the safest choice. Once it arrived I excitedly attempted to use it to check out an ebook at my library. Sadly, in the last fews weeks my library switched from OverDrive/Libby to CloudLibrary. Kindle only works with OverDrive/Libby so now this thing is essentially worthless. It seems functional as far as it goes, but I’m just not going to keep something that won’t work with my library. I would think Amazon would make their ereader compatible with all ebooks. Had I known my library was switching I wouldn’t have gotten this. They’ve used OverDrive/Libby for years and made a budget decisions to switch last month. Ugh!"
Mrs.R.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I only purchased this because my Generation 1 got smashed -- car ran over it when husband left it on car roof when we were going to town --- groan. I loved that Kindle. This one should be great; but it's much slower to start up when I open to read. Actually everything is show. Why should this be? Since I bought it and my old one is gone, I'm keeping this; but I don't love it. Also, I bought the new cover to go with it and it hurts my hands (sharp edges/ not thick enough) when I'm reading in bed. Everything about this newest Kindle should be superior; but it isn't."
D. Wetzelberger,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, I like kindles. I have 3. The oldest was the second kindle issued that keeps me connected via cell phone and/or WIFI connection. With all the WIFI spots the phone connection feature is no longer an issue. It was about $250 still works and was great at the beach or reading in sunlight. The next kindle is a Fire (ver8). That unit is realitively inexpensive compared to an iPad. It's back lit so it is good for reading in the dark or in sunlight. The Fire can download movies. However, I could not use either Kindles at the gym to read while at the pool or in a hot tub. Hence I get the new kindle, not too expensive and waterproof. For my purposes it is great, both in the dark an sunlight. All the Kindles get updated and are connected to the last page read.

If waterproof is not an issue I would recommend the Kindle Fire as it can be used to view movies, newspapers and play games. To be fair, the iPad is more powerful but if you would like to read while traveling and not risk a lot if the device gets lost (risk of being stolen) then this or any of the other kindles are great buys.

The waterproof Kindle has good battery life, can adjust text style and size, has whitepage for sunlight and back lit for evening. The device is light to hold in one hand and the cloth case is great for added protection and turns off the device when closed. The waterproof Kindle is small a fits in a jacket pocket when being out and about."
Leah H,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this at Best Buy. After looking at Kindles and Nooks I went with Kindle because of the cheaper (and often free) books. I have an older Nook Glowlight that I hardly used because it was just slow and kind of heavy. I love how lightweight this Kindle is, and the screen is a good size. I feels nice to hold and in the few months I've had it I've been reading more than ever and actually prefer it to a printed book. (I never thought that would happen.) Unlike many reviews I've read, the screen on mine is perfect. I personally like having Goodreads connected but I know some people hate that. My only real complaint is that the power button is in the most inconvenient spot possible! It is right where I support the Kindle with my pinky when holding it and I have to be careful not to accidentally lock the Kindle while I'm reading. This can also happen when I'm resting it against my stomach or lap while laying down or sitting. Very frustrating. I have no idea why anyone thought that button placement was a good idea.

Oh, and the ads... sometimes they don't bother me and I have even bought a couple of the books that popped up in the ads... but even when I have no internet there is still an ad! Whenever the Kindle is locked but not in sleep mode there's an ad and it didn't bother me at first but has started to. I can't even go outside to read and relax without them trying to get me to buy something. I'm going to keep buying the books anyway so stop bugging me. You can turn off the ads from your Amazon account but if you do YOU WILL BE CHARGED $20 so be aware of this when deciding whether to buy the Kindle on sale or at full price. This was listed in Best Buy at full price and when I went to check out the cashier said ""oh, it's on sale!"" I had no idea the same came with strings attached. Just know that if you try to buy it in a store and rings up as being on sale, it means you are getting the version with ads."
Sarah Gerbick,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle. I can't stop reading books! It is simple, which I like. It is very light, lighter than most books. I don't use the screen light, so I'm getting better battery life than most people, I bet. It does not last more than 2 weeks on a charge, I mean, unless you don't use it. I have been reading a lot since I got it, and 2 weeks was about when I plugged it in to recharge. I also keep it on airplane mode all the time, except when downloading a new book. There is some glare on the screen, but not too bad and I just tilt it slightly. It connects to Goodreads, which I like because I can refer to my list of books I want to read next. I don't like that the screen has ads when it is woken up. It is nice that you can set a PIN to access it. I am looking forward to taking it with me when I go on my next trip because I plan to read a lot more."
JOG,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking forward to a clearer screen than I have with my old Kindle. It's not much different. I have to make the print bold to get enough contrast for comfortable reading. I never go below 75% on the illumination, except at night. ALSO, to call it waterproof is ridiculous when you read the accompanying literature. It's built to withstand an accidental splash with immediate remediation, but it's certainly not waterproof. Keep using the zip lock plastic bag. I traded in my old kindle, so I'm keeping it. But I'm disappointed"
Mike M.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are right handed the power button is in the worst place possible. Its directly under where you naturally rest your pinkey.

i hate how the pages have to refresh each time the page is turned. Some times they invert colors and sometimes the text takes a second to become sharp again. Minor but for $125 something simple should would flawlessly.

small pictures in books are sometimes hard to see. small text is in the book store is almost impossible to read.

Also as others have stated I did have to do a software update.

I did not have the issues with the pin hole bring spots.

overall this thing is ok. not great. i probably would not buy it again but if the battery life is better than my kindle fire tablet then i will be happy. So far so good with the battery. It did charge quickly with the included charger.

The power button placement is So fruatraiting. I makes me hate this thing as i bunp it constantly with a pinky or bump it on the desk or table top shutting it down. Just put the darn thing on TOP!!!"
Scurvy230,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, so ive never owned a kindle before. I bought the fire hd 10 and started reading on it, loved it. Then i bought this kindle to read on and what i noticed was it was a lot slower, theres no color the whole thing is black and white. Theres no dark mode like there is on the kindle app on tablets and phones., you cannot highlight in colors, which i like to do as well (kindle app) and overall it was just a little bigger than my iphone 7 (small), it wasent very smooth when flipping pages or just using in general., its like operating an ipod video from 2006 w modem speed wifi. Idk how this thing is so popular i returned mine and will be reading on my fire hd which is a wonderful experience."
Eclectic company,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle. The first was an early version I got in '09. The second was a Paperwhite I got in '13. Now this one. Neither of my old Kindles died, I just got new ones when they were 4-5 years old.

Battery life seems to be about the same as my old Paperwhite so far. Of course, I don't use the Bluetooth and Audible features, so if you do, ymmv.

It has a slight delay when waking up which I am not used to. It's only 2 seconds or so, but worth noting. It's also worth noting that during that ""waking up"" period the light is at a bright setting them reverts to your brightness setting. If you're walking up your Kindle in a dark room, be prepared.

Page turns happen much more quickly on this Paperwhite than my old one, which is nice.

The screen is much smoother and glossier than my old Paperwhite. This provides more chance for fingerprints. The fingerprints aren't much of an issue if you read in a dark room (which is what I usually do) but worth mentioning.

I opted to go back to list view for my homepage instead of tile view as I have trouble reading the tiles in grayscale.

This is a note on the software itself and not the device. I wish when a word was highlighted to bring up the definition, it would pop up with the same size text as the book I'm reading. I don't have terrible eyes, but I can't quite make out the print with such small printing."
TS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am new to this electronic reading, and it takes some getting used to, but works out well because I can enlarge the letters, can change the lighting, and spacing so it's easier to read compared to paper books. Also, saves space and the weight of having to carry heavy books. It's like a library in a light weight calculator sized box. So far I do not have any pixel problems on the screen and it works well as advertised. I do not agree with reviews that it feels cheap, it is light weight as it should be and waterproof too. The Kindle-book advertising on it is not at all obstructive and limited, easy to get around them. Battery does tend to drain at a faster rate from what I expected, but if you are using it all day, it will last the entire time. I don't know about weeks though, even in sleep mode, I didn't have it that long. But, overall I think it is a good unit and for a reasonable price. 8G is plenty storage."
MrC,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The paperwhite is my first Kindle. While it does work as advertised, the responsiveness of the touch screen could be better and moving from screen to screen could be faster too. The CPU should definitely have been improved on a new model. I bought 2 of these from Target, because they had a %15 discount on Cyber Monday, while Amazon did. As a result, Amazon won't be able to verify this purchase to validate my review.

I'm not sure if I will keep these Kindles, I will try them for a few weeks"
cc armstrong,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second kindle. I had just bought the Paperwhite 3 on Prime day last year, but as soon as the 4 came out with the added storage and the waterproofing, I had been lusting ever since. Naturally when it went on sale for Mothers Day I had to scoop one up! Software speaking, it really isnt any different from the 3, but the waterproofing alone made me want to switch as someone whole loves reading by the pool/beach. And of course it has all the great features I already had with my previous Kindle that I love like whispersync...I love being able to read seamlessly between this, and my other devices without missing a beat incase I end up leaving my kindle at home. If you already have a Paperwhite 3 and don't care about the extra storage or waterproofing, then there probably isn't a need to upgrade, but if you are coming from an older kindle, or new to ereaders, than this is definitely worth getting!"
Chris Duckworth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this Kindle, 32GB, wifi only, no special offers, as my first E-reader! It has been a true joy to operate and use!
My only gripe, if you can call it that, is using the web browser like front page. It doesn't let me pull up the TOC for my book as it should. A minor gripe while reading fiction, but a veritable swamp of options when I try to pull up any bible verses by chapter and verse.
All in all, I love my new Kindle and hope to get many years worth of use out of her!!
After reading on it for a month, I cannot stress how awesome this unit is! No ""pinhole bright spots"", dead pixels or anything like that.
My only gripe? Nobody has hacked one to play Tetris! LOL
UPDATE!
I still use it almost daily, rereading the Bible right now.
It holds a charge where I only have to plug it in every week or so, screen look fantastic in any lighting. There is a slight glare when reading outside under direct sunlight, but it's not that bad!
I am really digging my new Kindle Paperwhite.
I love it!
UPDATE 2: Still loving it! The screen is great, battery life is good, I am still happy with it!"
R. Kokji,5.0 out of 5 stars,Had an issue w the battery life that was corrected by doing a hard reset.
MSR,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The negatives first: Amazon does not allow Wikipedia to be removed as a reference. Not only does Wikipedia contain much, much misinformation but it is involved with censorship of accurate content. I don't want it popping up when I want to look up a definition. The Paperwhite display is black and white and most book artwork shown in black and white is pretty blah and hard to read. When I look up the definition of a word, the dictionary font tends to be smaller than I'm comfortable with and doesn't match the font size used for the book text. Perhaps there is a way to control this but I haven't found it yet.

On the positive side: I switched from a low end Fire to the Paperwhite. The Paperwhite is lighter and much easier to handle. Navigation from page to page can be done by a tap on the left or right side of the screen - much less distracting than having to swipe. On my Fire I couldn't read with direct sunlight on the screen. The Paperwhite is amazingly EASIER to read in direct sunlight and the non-glare surface doesn't send back annoying background reflections like the FIre did. The reading time before the unit has to be recharged is way beyond what I experienced with the Fire. The settings most likely to be adjusted while reading are intuitive and very easy to access. At first I thought the Paperwhite was pretty small, but after using it for a while I found the size wasn't a problem and the portability was great."
Vena,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pleasantly surprised by this. I had one of the original Kindles, the one with the keyboard, which (after 8 years!) was finally starting to be too much of a hassle to charge EVERY time I wanted to use it. Upgraded to the new Paperwhite after some research. I was originally concerned about turning the pages on the Paperwhite, my old one had buttons on the sides, right where you hold it so that turning the page was very easy. I was worried this would be awkward on the Paperwhite since I actually have to touch the screen. Not at all. The boarder is thin enough that turning the page is easy and does not interrupt the flow of reading.

The battery was about 60% charged when I got the kindle and lasted ~15 hours before needing charging. I had wifi enable that entire time and was traveling.

The display did take a little time to get used to, but just because it is so different from my previous version. There are quick settings that pull down from the top of the screen when reading so that you can easily change the brightness. Expanded options are another touch away, increasing functionality farther.

I have noticed that if you add your Good Read account the push notifications can be annoying. This will enable the Paperwhite to automatically update your start and finish read by dates, but will prompt you for ratings and review, sometimes when you are not actually even finished reading!

I also got mine with the advertisements. I must admit I rather like them. They are simply book recommendations (pictures only, never video, sound, or scrolling) on the screen when the kindle is asleep and banners along the bottom or side when on the home screen. Advertisements are NEVER while you are actually reading."
Crage Nelson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the feel of this device. Great size, LEDs work great. PPI are sufficient. Love that I can download so many books. Battery is pretty good, but dropped faster than I expected. I turned the light almost to the lowest and turned off bluetooth and WiFi. I'm sure that's the disclaimer is that the battery lasts weeks when you use this for 10 minutes a day with all radio turned off and the lights off. Really not a fan of the ads rotating on the screen when not in use. Seems like if I'm paying for the device and the books I should have the option to not have ads on my device. Maybe that's a thing and I haven't figured it out yet. Biggest thing is the power button placement. Blows my mind. I haven't had accidental shut-offs like others have complained about, but with so many devices out there with the power button on the top or right side, it doesn't make sense to put it where your hand rests."
Christopher T. Slaterbeck,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t normally give 5 star reviews, but the new kindle is great. My biggest problem with the previous model was the inset screen, and they’ve done away with that in this model. The extra memory doesn’t impact me much, since I keep most of my books in the cloud and only have about 100 downloaded at any given time.

This model includes Bluetooth connectivity and Audible support. If you use audible you will definitely appreciate the extra memory. However, I use audible on my phone, so why do I need it on my kindle, too?

Being waterproof is an extra bonus. I don’t read in the tub, and waterproof doesn’t mean sandproof, so I won’t take it on the beach.

I highly recommend getting and Armorsuit screen protector. It doesn’t make it more reflective, is easy to install without bubbles, and provides good protection.

Update: I took off two stars because Amazon’s engineers still haven’t figured out after multiple generations that it’s idiotic to put the power button on the bottom. When you try to prop it up on something or put it on a stand it turns off more often than not. DUMB DUMB DUMB!!!!!!"
Carolina Who Fan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this to replace an earlier generation of the Paperwhite because it stopped charging. I'm actually somewhat disappointed in this one - I don't need the water resistant feature, and I guess because of that, they changed the seam in the Kindle to one that sticks out. When I hold it for a long time (I can read for 3 or 4 hours straight), it really starts to dig in to my finger and it hurts.

Also, the screen is different. This one really bothers me - the old one had a very nice screen that wasn't glossy and didn't show fingerprints as easily. I also have fingers that touchscreens evidently don't like at all and there are a lot of times that I have to swipe 3 or 4 times before it will turn the page. I never had that problem on my original Kindle.

If I could have replaced the charging port on my old Kindle I'd still be using it."
Judy P.,2.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t like that when I’m not at home and connected to my WiFi I cannot purchase/download a new book. I thought I was buying the kindle that would allow me to buy and download a book anywhere. I was apparently wrong. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION to the options you are buying. They seem to have different options based on what you purchase. I have the WiFi version only and that was not what I wanted. I called customer service and they said I should be able to download anywhere and sent me a replacement saying something must be wrong with the device. So here I am with a “replacement kindle” that does not download anywhere. I love the Kindle for I read about 5 books a week but when I’m not able to purchase and download another book when I leave my house is a bit frustrating.
Anje Woodruffe,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ugh! I bought this as a gift for my husband and he’s being polite by using it. It’s incredibly slow to start up and takes forever to reach a full battery charge. The lighting is adjustable but it takes a long time for books to download. To connect to Bluetooth you have to shut it down and turn back on to reconnect which is very annoying since it doesn’t maintain the connection to recognize the same device ( wireless headphones). The 3 month trial is a little bogus since you can’t really download more than one book at a time and the connection is so slow your reading time is slow.
Don H,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my paperwhite!!!! I used to read from my 10"" tablet all the time. It was awkward and hurt my eyes making it hard to get to sleep when reading before bed. My paperwhite is like having a paperback book and sometimes while reading it I feel like I'm looking at a paper page. I'm pretty sure that was their intent. The lighting at night is gentle and easy on the eyes. The battery life is incredible with me reading daily and only charging every 7-10 days. It is easy too to change books to another topic to keep it fresh. When going back it opens to the point I left off on. I'm enjoying mine so much that I'm looking to buy another for my wife who spends hours reading on her phone, but keep it quiet...I want to surprise her. (Help me out Amazon and offer me another black Friday price)."
Bonnie Raiford,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My original Paperwhite still works after five years but the updates to the most recent one combined with a good deal ($40 off) helped get me off the fence to upgrade. I like the brighter screen, flush front design, (improves page turning), waterproofing and twice the storage. I haven't tried pairing it with Audibile but will try that should I sign up for Audible in the future. The layout is a bit different when you open it but I am getting use to it. For someone who has the original Paperwhite (the first one) this is a great upgrade. I can't speak for any versions between these two."
Will Gilbert,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to use my iPad for bedtime reading. All too often I’d get distracted by a text, email or other nonsense. The Kindle is great for bedtime reading, it weights less, has a softer light and, most importantly, no interruptions. The battery life is great. I read for about 90 minutes each night and can go for two weeks without a charge. Nothing but good things to say."
siouxcitysusan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"i have discovered that my kindle paperwhite will often turn itself off if i accidently brush the buttons at the bottom of the screen, where my hands are holding the kindle. i called amazon to see if i could somehow flip the kindle, so the buttons are on top, but was told 'no', even though every other electronic device i own does this. also, if you brush the screen while reading, font size somehow automatically changes, but you have to go all the way into settings to get it to go back to where you had it. i really want to enjoy this product, but it is proving very frustrating to read with."
nhmusher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Paperwhite was a replacement for my original one I received as a gift quite a few years ago. The battery on that one finally stopped holding a charge. As with my previous one, I use this Paperwhite strictly for reading books. My order arrived as three separate packages (the device, the cover, the charger) which was not a problem as they all arrived within a day of each other and much more quickly than the anticipated delivery date - easily within less than a week of my order being placed. I simply kept my old one charging when necessary. In my case, the cable that came with the device fit perfectly. However, Amazon did include a message and a link in their email with the contact information needed should I require a replacement cable. Everything is exactly what I was used to when it came to adjusting the background light, the font style and size, bookmarking pages, etc. Downloading is quick and easy. It is comfortable to hold and quite a bit lighter/thinner than my old one, which is nice. As for the 'special offers' which, yes, are a form of advertising - they are not a problem. I couldn't care less about what my wallpaper looks like or book suggestions that appear on the wallpaper. I bought this to read books, not look at wallpaper. I have actually found several books to add to my reading list with these suggestions. In my opinion this was a really good 'deal.'"
Will in Texas,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle was running slow so I thought I would take advantage of the $25 trade-in upgrade offer. The new model is not much different than the old one in terms of speed, and Amazon did not honor the trade-in but could not say why, (my unit was working fine, no scratches, no cracks - I was using it up until the day I sent it for the trade-in). The “guaranteed“ trade-in amount was $25 but without notice, or explanation of any type, all they gave was a $5 gift card that was set to expire THREE days from the time it was applied to my account! No way would I have surrendered a working Kindle for just $5 (would have given it to a family member) but I was not given that opportunity. And when I tried to contact them, Amazon kept me on chat for a half hour basically asking me to repeat the same thing I had just said, over and over (with five minute gaps of silence between). So I suppose I will be sending my Kindle back - I can just read on my phone. I don’t mind the loss of the $20 as much as I mind not being given a choice when they changed their terms and then not being able to get them to respond when I contacted them."
C1,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the third Kindle I own, somewhat disappointed.
Pros:
* Light weight and looks nice with flat screen
* Bright enough to read in the sun and when dark at night
* Option to set boldface font, which is not available on iPhone's Kindle app

Cons:
* It's slower than the previous model, it takes 3 to 5 seconds to ""warm up"". Also slower when going to Home page and switching to other books
* I had to reboot it within a week of light use. The screen became completely scrambled and not legible when I tried to wake it up. This never happened to my previous kindle
* Still doesn't have ""continuous scrolling"" option, which is available on iPhone's app"
Crisvely,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So, this is my first Kindle and I didn't really know what to expect, but I'm guessing the glitches it gets aren't really part of the experience? I would be reading in sunlight and the screen would just glitch out of nowhere. If I had epilepsy, there would be serious trouble (seriously, if you have the condition, don't get it).

The touch screen leaves plenty to be desired - I guess it's not fair that I'm comparing it to the quality of smartphones, tablets, and computers - and the feel of it is just so weird. Maybe I just need to get accustomed to it? IDK, man...

The battery life? Don't believe a word they say. If you read like a normal person - not the half-hour a day on the description - then it's the same battery as a normal phone. Not an iPhone, but like an Android, in terms of battery life. Still sucks.

In terms of screen light, it's a ""meh"" on that one. There's really no discernible difference between the light from the Kindle and the one from my phone.

Overall, I'm lowkey disappointed. I expected more out of the Kindle craze."
Caitlin Scott-Turner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle — first generation — was fabulous, and I loved it! I’ve always been a book person — I ran a bookstore for years, and always prided myself on what my foreign-born boss called “book knowledgement”. I thought switching from the printed page to digital books would be difficult, but it was wonderful. Now it’s just me and the words — no looking at the cover, no flipping pages. Just the words, the power of the language. My first Kindle was actually filled to the brim (I know, the cloud has no limits, but the machines do), so I upgraded to the new one and I’m thrilled. I’m not going to read it in the bathtub — why would anyone ever do that?! — but I love its capacity, and I love that it shows the covers of each book in each of my libraries. Who knew?! This is a marvelous words machine and totally worth the money to upgrade."
Linda Larrymore,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my husbands 2nd Kindle paperwhite. He reads a lot and his 2nd generation (2013) is losing the charge faster than usual. So I decided to buy him this 10th generation for Christmas.
It does not seem that there is any difference other than 32 GB instead 16GB. The size and weight is the same and I hope that it lasts as long as the old one!
I can not imagine that anyone read a paper book anymore. We travel and fly a lot, it holds a ton of books and is so small to pack!"
Jose Duarte,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently moved from one place to another and lost the benefit of having a bookshelf. I was sad to pack up almost my entire book collection in storage bins but it had to be done. I opted to buy a Kindle because it would be an easy way to take my books with me. I had an extensive list of books I really wanted to read and couldn't fathom having to buy them all only to have my wife yell at me for not reading them. With a kindle, I could add books to my wish list so I could track what I wanted to read but also would give other the chance to buy books off my list as a gift (since no one wants to buy me Magic: the Gathering cards anymore). I absolutely would recommend buying one if you're looking to declutter from your massive library. Plus Kindle Unlimited really good for getting into some more reading. Currently the entire Harry Potter books are on Unlimited."
D. Lippa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s a kindle, no it’s a book, no it’s neither because it’s a kindle whitepaper! The kindle whitepaper is awesome! It is way more than I expected. It allows you to read on kindle unlimited and you can also buy eBooks directly. If you wish you can get a library book (using a different device) and read it on the kindle. My favorite part is that if you turn the light level to 0 you can read it like a book. The light level is how much light there is coming from the screen. At 0 the screen looks like paper, can be read from without damaging eyes and does not glow. It also is the weight of a normal paperback book so it feels book-like. My grandma commented “I normally do not like reading eBooks but this looks and feels like a book!” This is a piece of tech worth your money."
Gail DiBona,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love all my Kindles and I have MANY. There was a problem in the past with the charging port in my Kindle Fire that I could not get any assistance with but what I've now learned (which nobody warned me about) is that if you don't keep your Paperwhite charged, even if it's brand new (which mine was) it will go dead and NEVER be usable. I picked up my never before used Paperwhite and it had an exclamation mark on it. When it wouldn't charge I looked on line and saw many complaints. I called customer service and they told me that yes, it was now useless and they couldn't do anything for me. Very poor customer service, especially since they can see how many different Kindles I've purchased for myself and for others. And there should be a warning on the box."
Beth Friend,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've held off on buying a kindle for forever. I wish I had bought it sooner. I like being able to read without straining my eyes or worrying about a battery. It's almost as nice as reading from a real book. I also travel a lot but taking 3-4 books on a trip is annoying and cumbersome. This makes it so much easier (especially when flying). The lighting adjusts well and it connects to Wifi easily making it easy to sync with your amazon and goodreads accounts. The ads are not intrusive (literally only when it's waking up) and some of the recs have turned out to be great. Worth saving a little bit of money for something that never bugs me. The only thing that could use some work is the touchscreen. I don't know if it's because I'm used to my phones response but it seems delayed at times. Otherwise, I love everything about my Kindle."
Riley,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve never owned a strict e-reader before, I’ve only ever owned smart tablets (kindle fire, iPad). So I am not a connoisseur at all and therefore my review is more for the common person like me.

I found this reader to be very pleasant to use. The text is really crisp. The white of the background is as clean as fresh linen. My battery life has been wonderful (this was bought right when it came out and boxed until Christmas, I never charged it and used it daily for almost a week before charging it last night when it finally reached 12%). I like to read fan fictions and the site I use allows for the download of .mobi files, which you can email to your device. I love that I can turn down the brightness when I’m in a light room and turn it up to read at night and it still doesn’t really feel like a “tablet” even though it’s bright. I can hold it with one hand. I can fit it in my pocket and take it everywhere. I’m so glad I finally got one, this baby is gonna get a lot of use!"
jime,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Paperwhite is absolutely grand. The flat screen alone is enough to put your doubts aside. If not the price and the outstanding software update. Kindle e-reader Paperwhite makes reading so enjoyable. You can read inside, outside, bright light or no light it is self contained. Let alone all the books that you can carry in one hand.
If you are wondering of a purchase, buy it and try it out. If unsatisfied send it back and a fortunate person can purchase it as a refurbished item with a good discount. You will do them a great favor.
Again I say if you are a reader I cannot see how you can go wrong with the convenience of the Paperwhite and the price. For me it hit the target."
adam sisk,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first kindle i have ever owner and i am in love with it. the design is very thin and lightweight. the screen is crisp and clear and so easy to read in any lighting or sunlight. the only time i ever turn the built-in light on is at night reading in bed. other than that i keep the light off all day. it’s just like reading a regular book, NOT like looking at a usual screen. Very easy to read in bright sunlight. Battery life is amazing and it’s very easy to use.
some reviews complained about the lock button being too easy to press, but i've never had that problem and i’ve held the kindle in many different ways, even propping it up resting on the bottom with no issues at all.

Overall i am more than satisfied with this product and so happy i bought it! absolutely a must have"
Linda Patton,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My sister finally talked me into upgrading from the third Kindle to this paperwhite. My main problem is the touch screen. I don't use touch screen technology on computers (I'm still a mouse person) and I don't like it on the Kindle.

Some examples: the screen flips ahead (sometimes several pages) by itself. It is almost impossible to pull up footnotes indicated in a book. (I purchased a guide to using the Paperwhite - it didn't even mention footnote access.) Highlighting or entering notes seems clumsy - haven't figured out how to do that yet.

What I do like about the Paperwrite: easy access to the dictionary and Wikipedia through the search function. I use my Kindle to help work crosswords, and this technology really helps. (Searching for crossword answers on Kindle also expands my reading horizon when I find books I normally would not look for.)

If only Kindle could produce an E-Reader which has the technology of the Paperwhite with more precise methods of using the features."
ogecko,3.0 out of 5 stars,"None of the new features of the Paperwhite are advantageous to me, a single battery charge still only lasts about 3 days for me (not ""weeks""), and having the power button on the lower right remains *very* annoying (because I keep accidentally turning the device off). If anything, I find this update to be less satisfactory than my old Paperwhite: it seems wider and therefore it is more difficult to hold one-handed and there's something about the display that makes for a less satisfactory reading experience (I had to play with fonts and sizes to get something that I found to be acceptable).
However, I bought the new version because I kept getting ""application errors"" when accessing the Kindle store with my old Paperwhite: the new one gets an application error only once in a while, so from that viewpoint the purchase was worthwhile. Also, I traded in my old Paperwhite and Amazon gave me an additional discount on a new one, so it was less of a gamble than it would otherwise have been."
Christopher,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First the pros:
- waterproof
- incredibly fast responding screen
- Much easier to highlight words/passages
- scrolling much faster and no hiccups
- very lightweight

Now the cons:
- Yes, there is a slight glare as compared to the previous version
- Unable to tap lower left hand corner to jump from page/time left in chapter/time left in book. You have to go through all the page settings to skip between and only one will be allowed on the main screen.
- there now seems to be a 'waking up' stage after letting the device be inactive for a long period of time.
- also the auto sleep/wake feature that was utilized by some Kindle covers no longer works

I must admit I'm really loving the fast responding screen. And the amount of non-issues I have with the devices functions. THis seems to be the trade off to my cons.

Update: I'm now on my 3rd one of this edition of Kindle Paperwhite since the other 2 just quit working. Very disappointed in this edition."
fussball,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a big Kindle user; I use mine every single day. I've had my current Paperwhite since 2015. The Prime Day deal on the new Paperwhite was compelling so I took the opportunity to trade-in and upgrade. After just an hour using the new Paperwhite I am sending it back. The level of glare on the screen is unacceptable (way more than my current kindle). It is VERY slow to boot up and the screen is unresponsive. I saw a number of other folks stating that they were disappointed after upgrading, and I am now joining the chorus. I hope Amazon is able to come out with a better device in the future. I LOVE my 2015 Kindle Paperwhite and I will be going back to that one the minor upgrade of waterproofing isn't worth it. Couldn't Amazon do more with 4 years to develop the technology on the device?"
Bella,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that I can read this kindle just like my old one without straining my eyes. The built in lighting reflects on the screen instead of generating from the screen, which keeps it easy to read and removes the need to carry around an attachable reading lamp. Two things I miss about my old (2nd generation) Kindle, the battery life lasted WAY longer and I didn't have fingerprints all over my screen because I used buttons to switch to the next page. My old Kindle lasted me at least 7-8 years and I hope this Kindle lasts that long as well. Time will tell. The new kindle (even in battery saving mode/ Wifi Off/ etc.) does not have a battery that lasts as long as the older Kindles in my experience. I have to charge it at least once a month if I'm reading frequently (a few times a week)."
Born to Travel,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this on Prime Day and when I received it, I found that it would not fit into my old case. No problem, I thought. But when I went to order a new case, I found that there are two different sizes of 10th Generation. The 2019 10th Generation is smaller than the 2018 version and it is nearly impossible to find out which version you have. (I finally found it on the original box in tiny, tiny print.) Other than that, I like the batter life, but don't think it is all that much more than my prior batter life. And it seems to be a bit slower to wake up. But I like the extra storage. All in all, I would recommend it, but shame on Kindle for not naming the new one 11th Generation or something so you can find appropriate accessories (or at least put the Generation date on the ""Your Devices and Contents"" page."
Patrick M. Burke,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a proclamation that I have finally crossed over into an era that I wasn't sure I wanted to enter: Kindle reading. Understand, I'm a lover of the physical book. I have a bookcases full of tomes that a small library would be proud to inherit. When the term ""book people"" is defined, MY picture will be featured. That said, my interest is very much about that is IN the books I own more than the physical book itself, in the same way I love listening to music from the 1920s but don't own a Victrola. I like to read more than I like to own because owning involves weighty issues during moves. The Kindle Paperwhite allows me to take any number of books to work with me to read while waiting to drive strangers to second locations for money (chauffeur). It hold a charge all day better than my iPhone. It fits in pocket or valise. It does what I ask it to without bothering me with unrelated ads...just like a book. I like it."
Thanatos of Nyx,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my partner for Christmas. I loaded 9000 books onto it, and hadn't even used half of the onboard memory. She loves it, and she owns a used bookstore, so i I love it if it makes her happy.

The only thing I personally don't like about it, is that with so many books loaded on it and yet so little memory taken up it makes it sllllooooowwww to load up the list of books, delete them, or much else. I realize that most people aren't going to have that many books on one but for those who do be warned of that. Also, even with the Wi-Fi turned off and the backlight turned off, the battery life was not what I expected having had previous Kindles and Nooks.

But all in all I'm pleased with it and with her reaction to it and I would recommend it. I know that many people have complained about it not having a charger with it, but this is 2019 and I have so many chargers around the house that's are coming out my ears."
holcojo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older basic kindle with the matte black edge around the screen. Took it to the beach with me and it got damaged by a wave.
Hoped that this waterproof version would be good but the screen glare is really bad.
My old kindle I could read anywhere. This one the lights from any room glare on the screen and make it uncomfortable."
Andrew,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to like this updated version, as I love the previous generations. However, I have found several aspects to be a downgrade. First, the new, flat screen has a glare on it. I live in the Midwest where it’s cold right now, so I haven’t tested outdoor reading yet, but lamps and overhead lights indoor cast a glare on the screen which is irritating. The previous generations did not do this. Second, the kindle as a whole really attracts and shows fingerprints. The smallest tap (which happens every time I turn the page...) creates a fingerprint. This is also something that did not happen with the previous generations. It’s quite frustrating considering the whole interaction with the e-reader is fingertip based.

The only reason I am not returning this product is because I got it on sale and the previous generations remain more expensive (which is also curious...). Amazon, as an avid kindle user and lover, I am left disappointed and frustrated with the Kindle Paperwhite 10th Generation."
Sflemaster,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle Paperwhite replaced one that I’ve had for years and it was a fantastic deal on Prime Day. The absolutely most frustrating thing about the new device is that sometimes it skips several pages if the screen is barely touched while reading. This happens pretty often making it a big pain. As for the battery, I suppose it would stay charged for weeks if you only read a few minutes a day. I keep it on airplane mode and try to keep the light down, which defeats the purpose, and I’m lucky to get 4 days. I didn’t notice any significant improvements but as I said, I got a great deal so there’s that."
Nancy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I already have one Paperweight Kindle. I bought this one specifically because it had Audiobooks; however, it does not allow you to listen to the audio-book while reading the text of the book. I love reading with both at the same time.
The sad thing is that I spent over an hour on the phone with a very nice Tech person, who had me download a voice update to fix the issue. When the device still would not do what I told him that I was trying to do, he did more checking and found that this device does not do it. I don't think the Tech person really knows the devices. He just reads directions from a computer screen. As far as I'm concerned, Amazon missed the boat with this updated version of the Paperweight."
Mark,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My tablet was finally dying and I didn't really see the need to replace it. But I did want to still read E-books. It made sense to buy a new Kindle device. Overall, I am happy with the Kindle Paperwhite. It was very easy to setup and there is plenty of space for storage of the books I am reading. There is plenty of adjustments available in terms of the size and type of fonts and how bright the screen is that I find it very easy to read on the Kindle.

There are really only two complaints. First, the actual reading area is too small. The width of the screen is fine but it would nice to have a longer page to read. I'm sure I will just get used to flipping pages. Second, the price for a cover is too high. It can be one third the price of the reader for a mass produced piece of plastic and faux fabric. I understand profit motives but this is silly."
Jon M.,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this because I had stopped using my older generation paper white and didn’t know where it was anymore. When I realized I hate reading on my phone I decided to get this. This is a huge letdown compared to the old one. The touch screen is not nearly as sensitive and turning pages is just slow. I then I brought it on a trip with me and it was frozen when I arrived and I could not reset it. By the time I returned to the US I was only eligible to get a refurbished model as a replacement but I could still send it back for a refund which is what I chose to do. I just searched and searched until I found my older model and that works much better than this one ever did. It’s possible I got a defective unit but I’ll use my old one until it dies now.
Tricia Canton,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was beyond excited to have received this from my sister for Christmas. I read a lot of books and have been wanting to go digital. I had a kindle prior so my library was uploaded onto it. Unfortunately, when it was time to charge it, I plugged it in, but it wouldn’t charge. I tried different outlets. Nothing worked. My brother-in-law looked it up, and apparently, I wasn’t the only one having the same problem. Unfortunately, my sister had to return it."
ccrad,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The flushed bezel and reduced form factor (vs. its predecessors) make this paperwhite feel sleeker in your hand. Other than that, there aren't too many eye-catching improvements that would warrant an upgrade. A quick overview of the highlights -
The GOOD:
- In addition to the flush face that improves the aesthetics and allows for waterproofing, the home page re-design is an improvement over previous versions (easier to discover content, especially if you're subscribed to KU)
- Audible integration. Although it's a feature I will likely rarely use, it's nice to have the capability to connect to bluetooth and stream audio books
- More hard-drive space (8 gb version) allows you to download Audible files, which can stretch beyond 500mb
The BAD:
- No comfort lighting or significant innovation on reading UX
- The E-reader store is in bad need of a revamp. Browsing and searching books on the Kindle is a painful process.
- Out of the box comes bloated with upsells and ads. I purchased the device for undistracted reading, please respect that."
Rick Milone,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This device has an abhorrent battery life. It is definitely NOT an upgrade from the previous generations (I've owned Kindles and Paperwhite devices since the Kindle keyboard). It simply won't hold a 100% charge.

In fact: while it's on the charger, simply turning on WiFi and syncing drops it to 99%--WHILE CHARGING. Contrast my other devices, including a new Samsung Tab A that takes at least 20 minutes of use before it drops to 99%. Leave the Samsung Tab at home for 8 hours off the charger? No problem: 100% battery. Take the Paperwhite off the charger and drive 30 minutes home from work? Down to 98%. That's unacceptable. I don't even keep the radios on (no Bluetooth, no WiFi).

There are other issues: the new screen is silky smooth, but seems to show more glare. It also gets smudges a lot easier than previous versions. And those smudges often affect the visibility of the text (makes it look blurry). Page turns whilst in books and in menus can be nearly unresponsive. I'm talking 3-4 seconds unresponsive.

I can't imagine listening to an audio book on this thing. I don't even want to test it. I'd think this thing would be dead within 2 hours. It's almost as if I received a corrupt battery. I won't be so quick to update again unless the next version has genuine performance improvements. Bluetooth for audio and a downgraded ""waterproof"" screen seem like upgrades intended for Amazon to push its Audible services and make it more difficult to replace batteries; but, they don't feel like upgrades for simply accessing and reading a book."
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a very heavy Kindle user. My original one was great and convenient; then I got a Kindle Fire, in several sizes because I like to read without glasses and then I can make the display big. The problem is the weight of the Kindle Fire.
Wanted a lighter one so I got the paper white, it is very convenient in size, but it is not bright enough. Was spoiled by the Fires ability to highlight in different colors for my own use, and how easy it navigated to Wikipedia when I looked up terms.

Yes, the Paperwhite is small and super lightweight. But I want a Kindle that is small and super lightweight so I can tote it around and look up everything that comes along in a historical fiction book in an easy way.

The touch screen is good and the battery life excellent.
I wonder if I should have gotten a Kindle Voyage."
KM Fab,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Kindle for for Christmas and so far it has been absolutely wonderful.
I was a little surprised by the size, (for some reason I imagined it to be a bit larger) but that isn't necessarily a negative thing. I like that it can fit in my purse or diaper bag and doesn't take up any room. It's very light in weight because of the material it's made from and it doesn't feel too delicate like you might scratch or crush it at any moment.
It was extremely easy to set up and I had zero problems downloading the books I wanted.
I will admit that the touch responsiveness is certainly a little slower than say, an iPad or other touch screens but I expected that because of the research I had done beforehand. It was very easy to figure out how to customize everything (the brightness, text size, etc.) and I had no problems connecting it to my wifi at home. I have not tested the waterproofness of it all and don't really plan to but it IS nice to know that it can get wet.
I am eager to see how it stands up to more frequent usage and will update my review if my opinion changes.
Overall I am very pleased with my purchase of this Kindle and would recommend to anyone looking for a nice affordable e-reader."
Gavin Ralbag,4.0 out of 5 stars,"By itself I would give it 5 stars compared to the last generation Kindle is give it 3. Overall I love it. Seems to study than the last generation but had everything you could want from an e-reader easily if you don't read exclusively Amazon bought e-books. My only real problem is that it freezes up in anything below 25degrees Fahrenheit. And so I have to hard reset it and it is this completely unusable in freezing temperatures. Like walking down the street. Also, I feel as if the battery doesn't last as long but I could be mistaken. But mostly if it didn't stop working properly in cold temperatures id give it a 5 for sure"
john,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had the regular Kindle for about 7 years and decided to upgrade. I have no regrets. This is so much nicer. First, the 300 dpi print does make a difference. It's much nicer to look at. I got the 8GB version and this is plenty big. I doubt I'll ever run out of space. I also paid the extra $20 to get the version that doesn't have advertisements and I'm glad I did. The 6 inch screen simply doesn't have space for ads so removing them gives a much nicer experience. The fact it's waterproof will also come in handy if I happen to be carrying it when it starts to rain. One less thing to worry about. The lighted screen does make it nicer to read in low light conditions. The processor is faster which makes turning pages etc much nicer. And lastly, this has numerous improvements in how it can be fine tuned to your liking. You won't regret upgrading to this."
Debbie L.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"November 2019... I’m changing my original review. After using this Paperwhite for the past 6 months, I have found that it is a great Paperwhite. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 as I still don’t like that the menus don’t disappear after tapping on an item, but overall.... A great e-reader. Thanks Amazon. I just ordered a 2nd one, so I must like it.

When syncing.... just tell it to sync and walk away for a few minutes. It’s not fast like a tablet or phone, so you just have to learn patience. I did.

Original Review....
I’m not really crazy about this new Kindle Paperwhite. I own the very first Paperwhite and I used to think it was slow until I bought this newest version. When trying to sync..... you just have to leave it alone or it will lock up.

Another problem.... When tapping on an item in the menu, the menu doesn’t go away. You have to touch outside of the area to get the menu to disappear. I traded in a Kindle Touch and I’m sorry I did. The Kindle Touch was a much better Kindle than this newest version of the Paperwhite."
fern,4.0 out of 5 stars,"this is so horrible compared to my kindle keyboard. the battery is 9 days, even when reading average 2 hrs a day with NO light and NO wifi (except when its on briefly to download a book). the light is a reallllyyyy harsh blue and totally obnoxious. the kindle keyboard 3rd gen battery lasted like a month --to the point where i forgot it ever needs charging at all and its as old as the hills. you cant even take notes on it, the way you could on keyboard version--you can only bookmark stuff.

Update: 1) chatted with tech person and battery on this model is not expected to be any where near as long as gen 3 keyboard kindle. so it appears my battery is quite functional--this is how they got a smaller and lighter device. 2) yes you can take notes--the way to do it was eluding me in the manual. someday they may make a device with a light option on the warmer end of color spectrum. meanwhile will experiment with light inversion."
Elvis,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So this is my first kindle. I did not understand how the kindle screen worked and I expected it to be like an lcd but this is not the case. Amazon did call me after I left a bad review initially but after talking with them I understood how the kindle functioned. When I scrolled through pages, I initially thought that this thing was buggy and lagging but this turned out to not be the case because the kindles screen is meant to mimic a real book and uses ink. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because there is no feature that allows me to make flash cards. As a student, this feature is very handy and was one of the reasons I got the kindle. I have the app on my iPhone and on my windows 10 and the flash card feature is great. The representative I talked to said she would forward this to development so I am hoping they can add this feature. Overall this thing is super light and definitely beats carrying around a text book. The backlight feature is amazing. This thing is also very great in the sunlight and I there is no glare."
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely disgusted with this product, the misleading descriptions on the app's page compared to the desktop browser page, and Amazon's customer service. Last Kindle branded device I will ever purchase."
OK Rancher,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle. I have the Kindle app on my smartphone and really like it. The reason I purchased this Kindle Paperwhite is because I am going to be bed ridden for some time and believe that it would be easier to use the Kindle rather than my smartphone to read from...since that is about all the activity I will be able to do. While I like my Kindle there are some features that I do not like. The touchscreen. When you first start it up, you have to swipe the screen to move past some advertisement to purchase a Kindle read. The swipe does not work very well, and it takes repeated attempts to get started. Battery life is very poor. I have to charge it during the day and overnight. The built in light is okay.. I initially considered purchasing the Kindle Fire, but after reading comparisons between the two, I opted for the Kindle Paperwhite. I may have regretted my choice."
Naku,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had the kindle keyboard for YEARS. And last I check it still works. But when I started to work more than I was. I broke down and bought one. Since I was tired of reading with the overhead light on. And I fell in love with it and shared it with my mom and dad so they could check it out.

Fast-forward to end of June start of July. I was at a job interview when my dad's kindle keyboard crapped out on him like WAY hard. I reminded him by showing him mine again. Made sure he got it with 32gb of storage as I did for mine. Sent him the same case I bought back then too. Now there are two people out of three who have one and love them.

Only con my dad has is how he holds it, his wrist bothers him in the morning lol. (That's user issue's on device issues.)"
Redwoods Reader,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well I wish I would have read more carefully about the size of this Kindle because it’s just way too small for me. I’ve had candles for years currently have a kindle fire 10 but it’s almost impossible to read in the sunlight with those so I bought the paperwhite specifically for that reason and also because it’s waterproof and I spend a lot of reading time near a pool. However I find this small size awkward to hold I am in reading I feel like I am constantly scrolling because of me so much info fits on the small screen. On a bright note something so small will be nice for traveling.
Update I’ve gotten used to the smallness and while on vacation I did take it in the pool on my floaty I do like it because I can wear my reading sunglasses and read with Evan in the bright sunlight"
Frank Brown,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my Paperwhite a few weeks ago and have been enjoying the ability to read while floating in a swimming pool. Today, I dropped it into the pool as I prepared to hop in. I knew it is supposedly waterproof but I nevertheless felt a panic and immediately hopped in to grab it. The pool is under 6 feet at its deepest, so theoretically I could have taken my time and fetched it within the hour, but I'd prefer not to take the risk. It suffices to know that I can do what I did today and not have a brick on my hands. Fantastic!
I am able to easily read the Paperwhite in the direct sun while wearing sunglasses. And having variable font size leaves nothing for me to complain about.
I highly recommend the Kindle Paperwhite."
Solitaryreflection,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok so this is my first Kindle so probably my review is going to be a bit biased. First of all, I a huge reader and I prefer normal paper books, so what prompted me to buy an e-book reader? First, it was Amazon’s Prime library that has tons and tons of books, which I really wanted to try, secondly and probably the most important reason, I have a four year old who co-sleeps with us. I cannot read a book, a paper book, when’s trying to sleep for obvious reasons. But with Kindle Paperwhite, I can read easily without distracting him or disturbing him. The display of Kindle is even less glaring than my Apple iPhone but perfect to read. Also when my Kindle arrived I was amazed that a device so small can hold up so many books. Kindle also has a built in dictionary. You can highlight passages and share them on Goodreads or Twitter. It has very good battery life. I charged it four days ago and it’s still going really well. If you are a voracious reader, you should have this reading device."
OakCityBooks,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was on the fence about upgrading. I have the very first Kindle Paperwhite that came out and still love it! It works awesome and has amazing battery life. I didn't really have a reason to upgrade, except we spend time at the beach, by the pool, and I love to read in the tub. So, I kept going back to read the reviews about the NEW Kindle. I read the reviews daily for over a month and was really torn about buying it. I finally bought it last week when the price dropped for Father's Day and wanted to even wait a week to post a review because I wanted to truly have time to give an accurate representation in my review about how I like it. I don't really miss the bezel edge of the older one. I was worried about the screen and some of the problems others have posted and have not had any issues like that. I purchased the case for it and also LOVE that and worry less about the screen than before. I haven't had any problems with the wifi or battery life and I've read 3 books on it now. If you're on the fence and you don't LOVE reading by the water, it's not that big of a difference. But, if you're like me and want to read by the pool, this was a great find. Also, I still have my other Kindle and cannot dare to part with that one. I hope this was helpful. If only I could find a way to make a living reading books!! :)"
Courson household,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I feel I might be a bit premature reviewing as it's been the holidays and I haven't made it through a book yet.
I do however love that it's the size of a paperback. I own a note 9 phone and the kindle is lighter than it is.
The light is amazing I wish there was an easier way to turn the screen off. I will be buying a case that puts it to sleep in the near future.
The touch screen is a bit iffy at the moment, but I'm sure it's something I'll get used to.
I use the overdrive app through my library as well as kindle unlimited and I have a wealth of books I can't wait to read.
The battery life so far seems great, again, I haven't got to use it much. But as the mom of 4 I love how I can just set it down and get back to it when I have time.
In the end, my very favorite thing that puts it way above the kindle fire, is that it's JUST FOR BOOKS. as I librarian, I need to read books for collection development And while I prefer the feel of a real book, the Kindle is so much easier with my life. And this offers no distraction. No games or social media to distract me, just books.
Overall I'm very happy with my purchase and I hope it will serve me well!"
stacey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a first Gen Kindle that gets neglected because I can't use it in bed without a cumbersome booklight or case. I finally decided to upgrade to a Paperwhite when I saw my friend's, but I was still skeptical that there would be that much of a difference in the devices...which, looking back, seems pretty silly.
Anyway, I ended up buying a used Paperwhite buy the seller sent me the wrong version. I was so impressed with the older Paperwhite that I took the plunge and bought the All New Paperwhite. Wow!!
Great device. Super easy on the eyes. Nothing like staring at a computer or tablet screen. Set up was easy and it paired with my bluetooth headphones immediately, without issue. Highly recommend this device!
OH and in case you don't know, you can use an app or your computer to borrow books from most libraries. They'll send em to your kindle for free! All you need is a library card!"
BklynReader17,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After 10 years my keyboard Kindle was dropped and gave up the ghost. I knew there would be a learning curve with whatever version I purchased so I waited 3 months before posting this review.

So far - I'm still adjusting to not having physical button to advance the page from the left and swiping but overall this newest Kindle has plenty of space, battery life is great, enjoy ability to adjust the text size and love the included back light so I can read at night. This version is definitely lighter than my former keyboard version so if anyone else has been holding out because old faithful is still working the weight is worth going ahead with the upgrade.

I have to make time to redo my folders but otherwise I have no major complaints with this long overdue upgrade."
Ms. Meowgi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been with the Kindle Fire since 2010-ish and I finally just purchased this new Paperwhite. I had the original paperwhite before the Fire and loved it. I'm so glad I went back. This new Kindle is so light and compact and I love that it's water-resistant. I've been reading in the pool with no worries. The battery lasts pretty long- I'd guess around 14-16 hours- but not as long as the previous versions. Overall I'm VERY HAPPY with my purchase, and I bought it on Prime Day and save $40 so that was a great bonus!"
Linda Vander Jagt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle. I just received it to get me three the quarantine, I have always bought and read book. Right away I was able to get a few good books on sale and start reading. I didn't think I would like it but I do. Easy to read, it remembers where i left off, you can look up words and more."
Donald W Zur,2.0 out of 5 stars,I was unable to register this product to my existing Amazon account using 2 factor authentication (2FA). The screen would lock up on the page after you enter your username and password....where you would enter your OTP (one time password). It would not allow me to enter the code that was sent to my phone. I finally wound up disabling 2FA and registering the device. I suspect the old firmware version 5.12.1 that the device was shipped with is the issue. I updated to 5.12.4 but and not sure if it fixes the issue. Also seems like the battery drains pretty fast...to early to tell if this is issue. Overall this has been a pretty frustrating start to my kindle experience...hopefully things will get better from here.
Alfred E.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I still have the original Kindle Fire I purchased in 2011. Since then I have added 4 more various Kindles for my Wife and I. My Latest is the Kindle Paperwhite. I have wanted to try one for several years but finally purchased one when the price hit a new low. What a bargain.
Things I love are the easy to read screen. I was a bit spoiled by the larger screen on the Fire but find the Paperwhite in landscape mode is very doable. I really love the fact that I can read in conditions that made my Fire unreadable. Bright sunlight.. No Problem. Lightweight and compact it is so easy to carry along. Waiting on the Wife?? Whip out the Paperwhite and read a while. Battery life is very good when the WiFi is turned off. With it on it seems to run down lots faster.
There are still several things I am learning about this machine but overall I am very happy with my purchase."
Consumer Cares,5.0 out of 5 stars,I actually won this at a fundraiser and had wanted one even though I own an iPad and iPhone. It’s hard to read in bright sunlight on those and this paper white is perfect for outdoors without getting overheated. My only complaint is that somehow I mess up on the pages and have to find where I was. Maybe I will get better at it in time.
Carolyn,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I hated, hated, hated the ads which were LOADED onto the device. There were so many ads that they interfered with the functioning of the device. When I FINALLY got through to a helpline/chat room and they FINALLY understood that I could not ""Press the home button"" because the device was totally unresponsive, the gentleman immediately removed all the ads. It has at least functioned since that removal, even if not very well.
The directions with the Kindle paperwhite were mostly non existent and were not at all helpful if the device was not functioning properly, or, indeed, not functioning at all. I have made an uneasy peace with the Kindle, which sometimes works well and other times doesn't work at all. It will have periods of being non-functional.
I loved my first three Kindles, but not so much now. I would love to have my last Kindle back. This will most likely be the last one I'll ever have because of all the problems with it."
Mom'n'Writer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to trade in my most recent Kindle Paperwhite for a new one, while they were on sale. I'm really glad I did! The battery life is quite a bit longer than the other one. But the biggest difference (!!!) is the time it takes to download books. I'd had three different Kindles before this, and the oldest two downloaded books about four times faster than the third, which was (I think) a seventh generation. To my delight, this new one downloads just as fast as my earliest ones.

I did have a little trouble getting used to the new screen--without the raised frame, I kept turning the pages by accident. But once I attached a pop-socket to the back, that problem was solved. Great product! Looking forward to using it in the pool this summer."
Gary A. Seaton,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my third Kindle, and I've loved them. I have nerve damage and arthritis that makes holding up even a medium sized book difficult. My Kindle White was the answer, and I could read at night without keeping my wife awake.
This one came in November, but for the past month has acted strange, not really ""responding"" very well or quickly to swiping or changing to library or whatever. Sometimes took 2 or 3 attempts to do something. But three nights ago, it just stopped entirely. I can charge it. I can turn it on and get a ""page"" with ""Swipe to unlock Kindle"" at the bottom. But nothing I've tried gets me farther. Once or twice it ""tried"" to go to the page I was reading, but immediately goes back to the opening page. It just won't work. I haven't dropped it, gotten it hot or cold (it ""lives"" in my bedside table.)"
H2OLvr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been purchasing Kindles for at least 15 years and am guessing that this new 2018 Kindle Paperwhite waterproof is my 3rd or 4th version. I use it every week and recently even signed up for Kindle Unlimited, because I read so much. This Kindle is good, but frankly I didn't think it was much different from my previous version. I bought it mainly because I recently built a swimming pool and wanted to read ""near"" the water. I really didn't trust that this Kindle was truly waterproof. Boy was I shocked today when I found my Kindle in the washing machine when I went to transfer sheets to the dryer. And it's still working! Even the case survived the wash process. That means the Kindle was in water for at least 30-40 minutes and survived two high speed spin cycles. That's very impressive. Bravo Amazon!!"
CNYGamer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"A member of my family wanted my previous generation Kindle, so I gave it up and bought the new model. Wow. Honestly, I wish I kept my old one and bought my family member this one.

The screen protector is highly susceptible to smudges, and actually has more glare than the previous generation. Like, a lot more glare. Also, the lack of raised bezel sounded like a plus, but in practice makes the model a little less comfortable to hold. Plus, since the bezel is likewise covered by the screen protector, it is prone to ugly smudges.

The battery life seems fine to me. I am a frequent user of my Kindle, and I have not noticed a difference from the previous generation in terms of battery life as has been widely reported by other reviewers.

Don’t get me wrong. It’s still a Kindle and it’s the best e-reader you can get. It’s a fantastic reading experience. At this point, we’re just quibbling over fine details. I was just surprised that this model felt like a step backward over the previous generation.

Honestly, though, Amazon should just give these things away in some sort of package deal. Buy 10 books and get a free Kindle, or something."
MIMI ZWERLING,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love, love, love this new Kindle. My only complaint is that the page either advances if I even breathe hard, or it will stick and not advance when needed. However, it is still easy to laugh about it. I did not ask that this be done, but all 2,793 books on the original Kindle are currently residing on the new one and there is still lots of room to go. I shall be a busy girl.

I went by price in choosing a new cover. It is far more beautiful (and charming) than I could ever tell from the picture. On the front is a little girl choosing books to read, while on the back her brother is seated, reading. The cover is smooth to the touch and easy and comfortable to hold.

I am truly pleased with these two purchases."
Susanne Barrett,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As I soak in a jacuzzi every night before bed as water therapy is part of my wellness routine, I am thrilled to now feel safe using my Kindle for reading instead of a library book. I have had to replace three library books over the years for nodding off and dropping them in the water! Now having a waterproof Kindle takes away all of the fear (and the expense!) of dropping a book!

In addition, I had maxed out my first-gen Paperwhite's memory over and over; the amount of material in the Cloud was much higher than what was saved in my Kindle. We bought the one with the extended memory, and I love it!!

The only drawback to this Kindle is that it's much more ""touchy"" than my first-gen Paperwhite, and I'm constantly turning back several pages when I inadvertently brush against the left side of the Kindle. Otherwise, it's awesome, and I love it!!"
Melissa Goodwin,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Kindle. Firstly, the only way you can find a new book you have downloaded is to go to the computer, sign in to Amazon and Manage your Devices. If you remember the name of it, you could look it up on the Kindle. Otherwise, it is just lumped in there with all the rest of your books on the Kindle. I like to immediately put a new book or even a completed book in a collection. Of course there is no way to alphabetize said collections. More wasted time. Not impressed. I like things orderly and this is not. There should be some way to just see, on the Kindle, the most recent books you have downloaded. My last Kindle was that way. After the collections, these books were listed there, ready for me to categorize. Now when I look at ""Books"" I see all the books I have downloaded along with all the Collections. In other words, there are duplications in this list as all the books on my Kindle are also in the Collections. Unorganized and messy. Not impressed at all."
Michael G. Bailey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got one of these for my wife so that she would not have to tote around stacks of books. She has been reading more lately, and the dead trees simply are not as portable. I had my doubts as to whether she would like this. She tends to be anti-screen time and views sitting over a paper book as a virtue. She fell in love with this Kindle and has already consumed a half-dozen books in 2 weeks. Her reading volume has only increased, and she says her eyes do not feel any of the strain of other e-devices such as tablets or smartphones. Slam dunk! I myself still love the smell and feel of paper books, but I was watching enviously as I lugged a few pounds of books on our last ski trip, while she idly tossed her Kindle into her purse. Maybe I will make the switch next year."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It handles text like gangbusters - 5 out of 5.
It fits conveniently in my trouser pocket even with the leather case - 5 out of 5 again.
It is terrible with photos and illustrations. I will never buy a cookbook for this device - 1 out of 5.
It's web browser sucks. You cannot research/buy a book from this device - 1 out of 5.
Waterproofness? Dunno, never had occasion to find out - ? out of 5.
Bluetooth connectivity? hmm, think I'll try Audible."
J. Doldo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second kindle, my first was a kindle fire. I found I had to make the font bolder there are reviews in here that state how the font isnt crisp or grayish but I found if you make the font holder it just fine
I dont like that there isnt the carousel like on thr fire where you can spin thro6thr book covers and there is no color for the book covers but that's minor
I can read it great outside and at night.the back light isn't as harsh as on the kindle. I've had it over a month and just had to charge it. The charge lasts quite awhile. I like how it links to goodreads but dont like that there isnt a keyboard to type in the reviews you can only click on the number of stars but again that's minor. I love my kindle!"
D. R. S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this to replace a paperwhite that got wet.The waterproof factor is important to me. I live near beaches and often take grandson to the pool. It seems lighter weight than old one and fits my hands better.plus more storage for more books. I’m never without it! I take it everywhere I go. It’s so easy to to slip in my purse and go.
Joann White,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this Kindle! I've been holding out on getting a new one for a very long time. This is my second one - my first was an original Paperwhite - and I'm so happy with this model. For years I used the Kindle app on my iPad so that I had back-lit capabilities and only used my old Kindle when reading outside. I am so happy to now have both capabilities in a single device that lets me focus on reading without interruptions from app notifications. Plus it's small enough to hold in one hand! Makes it really easy to read in bed while lying on my side, something I struggled with when using the iPad. The controls are really intuitive, easy to access and provide you with great control over your library, although I would love to have a way to sort the books in my library by percentage complete. A battery charge lasts me for a couple of weeks before needing a recharge and that's with using it at least 2-3 hours a days. I've had this device for only a couple of months now but I'm hoping to get just as much value out of it as my old one."
Pat Carnaroli,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never used a device where the power button is so ill-placed. I have accidentally turned it off dozens of times because where I naturally hold it is apparently on the edge of the power button. Never had this issue with my previous Kindle. Also disappointed with the time it takes to power on. And the battery life is poor. Feels like a downgrade. Well done, Kindle team."
Jeremy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Background: Avid reader, I read probably a book a month, usually in bed in the dark and sometimes while camping/on vacation. I've owned the Kindle Paperwhite 2 previously.

TLDR: Unless you really want the waterproof feature and Audible Support, get yourself an older Paperwhite or the all new kindle (2019 version).

I really wanted to like this kindle. The more squarish and sleek design compared to previous models appealed to me. I bought this kindle because my wife wanted my old one, so I wasn't exactly looking for an upgrade, but I figured I might as well...and I'm rather disappointed with it.

Pros:
If this is your first kindle, you'll likely love it. Kindles are IMO the best ereaders available, and amazon's ecosystem works great with it. The kindle is rather sturdy, the new ""waterproof"" is always a plus, even if it isn't necessary for someone like myself who doesn't typically read anywhere around water...it's also rather robust, I've already had it fall off the bed (around a 3 foot drop) without any marks on it a couple of time. It's rather quick, battery life lasts long enough for me to forget about, and the back-light works great.

Cons:

Now, coming from a Paperwhite 2, this kindle isn't as great to use. The flush design, while stylish, actually is detrimental to usability. The flush bezel makes it harder to hold without accidental touch screen input, because you can't feel the border of the bezel anymore. Also sometimes just holding the bezel new the touchscreen causes page turns at times. Essentially, with this model, it's more difficult to hold vs kindle or older paperwhite models. Also, this design is much worse off for glare, fingerprints, etc. I feel like I have to constantly wipe the screen when reading in sunlight or bright areas. The backlight, while much brighter, the color temperature is much harsher in comparison for dark environments. It's more bluish vs the old light which was a slight amber color...that's a minor complaint that doesn't particularly bother me too much, but others may not like it.

Conclusion:
If this is your first kindle, you'll likely love it. My complaints are mainly around the ergonomics of the device, not necessarily it's use. That being said, ergonomics, in my opinion, are one of the most important features as you do have to hold the device while using it. One could also purchase a case for it to alleviate some of the issues I had with it, but of course, that means another purchase, and it makes the device rather bulky. I've never needed a case before as these things hold up quite well (my paperwhite 2 survived a house fire somehow), but of course, that's up to the user."
Renee S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the ""paperwhite"" thinking that the back ground would be white, like paper. The background is the same color as my older standard kindle, and will look ""whiter"" only if the built in blue lights are turned on. Also, the screen seems to loose some clarity compared to older non-touch/non-lighted models. I attribute this to a what appears to be a separation between a clear protective screen and the actual display screen that creates space for the lighting. Additionally, there is so much clutter on the home screen that there is only direct access to 3 books in my library, this makes switching between multiple books cumbersome. Lastly, the only way to turn on the lights is a soft button in the settings screen. If you start the kindle with the lights off in a dark location, there is no way to turn the lights on without using a separate light to navigate to the software button. (Hopefully there is a better way to do this and I just haven't found it)."
Caron Schwartz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an avid reader and early adopter of many things tech. I jumped on the e-reader bandwagon when Kindles first came out some 20 years ago. The first few were iffy -- batteries died, screens went kablooey -- and went back to Amazon, always to be replaced with amazing alacrity and usually no cost, by a newer model. I believe my last Paperwhite was No. 7. Nothing went wrong with it and I enjoyed it to the last minute. But Prime Day got the best of me, and the bargain price on the latest model was irresistible. Although it still made me happy, the older one got traded in. My nth Kindle is a big step up with better battery life, higher screen resolution, more screen settings, and it's waterproof. (As to my early adoption of many things tech, I got my first CPM-based personal computer in 1984, and was managing my contacts and calendar with a PDA and working out to tunes on a tiny MP3 player long before smartphones were a gleam in Steve Jobs' eye.)"
BT,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was using kindle with No back light and most of the time I always felt the need of back light, especially when flying. I upgraded to this kindle paperwhite kindle by doing a trade-in. I have got some 15 bucks for my old working kindle and also 25% discount towards purchase of new kindle.
The main difference between my old and new kindle is the newer kindle is 8GB, which means more storage and other definite improvement is the backlight which is 100% required add-on to the kindle. If you are thinking the extra bucks is worth for backlight, I would say YES and go for it! The brightness level of the backlight can be adjusted as per the need!
I have connected my bluetooth earbuds to this kindle without any hassle!
I didn't see much difference on the battery life between the older and newer kindle I owned. The newer kindle goes 5-6 days with onetime full charge with the use of 2-3 hours a day"
J. VanDusen,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't read as much as I used to since ""upgrading"" to this Paperwhite. I love reading at night. The dim back-light is perfect for not really waking me up so I can usually read a few pages then fall back to sleep. Unfortunately, when you turn on this Paperwhite it is very bright for a few seconds before switching to your selected level of brightness. I purchased this in January and barely used it all year. I'm going to switch it out for an older model.

Edit: I traded-in my Paperwhite after not really using it all year for ... wait for it ... $5. Amazon claims it's would not turn on. Ridiculous! It was working perfectly before I shipped. Do not waste your money on this ""upgraded"" Paperwhite. I wish I had kept my original."
JimL,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I started with a Kindle Keyboard, graduated to the original Kindle Fire (Touch) and then our kids gave me a Kindle Fire 7 for Christmas. I love it but it gives me eyestrain no matter what the setting and I started researching why Amazon was still selling simple black & white readers and decided to take a shot at this Paperwhite. Wow. The battery life is wonderful and it's way less susceptible to accidental page turns and ""go to chapter beginning / end"" than the Touch. It's lightweight and thin and the eyestrain is gone no matter what the ambient lighting. WiFi only, but that's not a problem away from home because if I need to log on I simply use my phone as a mobile hotspot. So far I love it and can read for hours without getting tired. This reader is a home run for Amazon."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Someone help!!! While reading on my kindle, it highlights pages without me touching the screen, skips pages, brightens or darkens the screen, enlarge the screen or minimize and the touch is not sensitive at all. I have to touch it many times for it to change the page. It has never fallen and I hardly use it for that reason. Specifically due to the touch not being sensitive. When it turns pages, the screen makes a charcoal dim of the screen; it’s not a smooth transition to the next page. I was going to buy an iPad againbut my friend said I should try the kindle. It hasn’t been working as I expected it would."
Cassiphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At least, I’m able to read all the books I wanted to read before having children some centuries ago. When I’m awake at 2am or even 4am, nursing, in the dark, reading a book was a struggle, but reading a kindle is a pleasure! If you spend time on your phone or petting your cat, buy a kindle, you won’t regret it. I’m that close to looking forward not sleeping at night ! And for the kids, it’s great too. (Well, too great actually … some of mine are fast readers so it’s going to cost me a fortune to keep up with them)."
Sarah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unlike what other reviews say, the battery life is good. I don't use the backlight when I don't need to (a big reason I got a Kindle was to not be staring at a bright screen) and I have set it to sleep after a time, so I am sure that helps with battery life. It easily lasts me a week and I can read multiple books on one charge. Even when I use the backlight, it still takes a long time for the power to go down. The only thing I regret is that I bought mine with ads, so it always wakes up on a lock screen. And sometimes the ads are something I don't want to see, like the cover page for a romance novel."
Volunteer Reviewer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd Kindle Reader. I love the smaller size so it fits in a pocket or purse. I do like the paperwhite. I do like that I can read it in a dimly lit room. I do like the ease of use. Couple of suggestions for future models: Move the charging cord from the bottom to the top or alternatively allow the user flip or change the screen orientation. (I end up having to buy additional cords because the charging end is bent so much the wires eventually break.) Allow the user to flip the screen orientation. If you fix where the charging port is then I can be more flexible about the screen orientation. A BIG ask is to allow the user to sort by Publication Date (and/or) a multi-layer search/sort such as by author and then by publication date. For those of us with over 1000 titles in our library, having a better organization system on the device would be helpful."
Jamie M,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is way smaller than the old ones and takes some getting used to its a tad smaller than a mass-market PB and the touch screen is super sensitive, The batter does not last long if you read an hour a day even if you turn it off and not just put it to sleep. The ""experimental browser"" is hard to navigate because it will open the last page you searched. It takes getting used to and can be a pain at points but I do like it but sure miss my old one. I liked it better"
Mike C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I read all the negative reviews and bought it anyway, My old kindle has seen a lot of use, the battery wasn't what it used to be and Have to wiggle the charging cable to get it charged. So I went with the newest version. I tolerated all the disappointments mention by others in the start-up etc. And I was please with the new additions such as sizing fonts, making bolder, and others. I down loaded some books and began. Tap to turn page, nothing happened. Tap again and again changing locations on the screen, still nothing. Tap again, the song went smaller. Back to settings and increased font to size. Back to page and tapped again. Got a settings window. Refrained from throwing kindle across room. Back to page and tapped again. Next Page! Now where was I in the story. Tapped to change to next page. Nothing happened. Return kindle to Amazon. That happened."
gayle b,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like my new e readers backlight , a upgrade over my previous one which I could not read in the dark. Had a problem getting it Connected to the internet. IT ONLY CONNECTS TO 2.4 G IF YOU ONLY HAVE 5G iT WILL NOT WORK !!! The Tech supports best advice was to call my Cableprovider. Waste of my time! All my other tech was working fine. Was almost ready to return it when I decided to read all the bad reviews. In the bad reviews I find out the answer. I immediately went into my router and switched my settings from total 5G to concurrent 2.4G and 5G . Viola !! It recognized my 2G and finally connected. No where in the description not did the tech
mention this. Thank you fellow Amazon's reviewers for sharing the information to help me."
LR McIvor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit: 6 months in, and I’m still thrilled I swapped up to this waterproof version. No glare issues, nor fingerprint frustrations that had concerned me at the time of purchase, from reading other reviews. Very pleased with the battery life and time to go from nearly dead to full battery.

I’ve loved my current paperwhite, that I’ve had for 3 years. I really wanted the waterproof for being outdoors with my kids. I was hesitant after all of the reviews about glare being worse, and fingerprints, etc.

I’m still in my first week, but so far glare is the same, and frankly the glare occurs at angles that I don’t actually hold the kindle for reading. Fingerprints wipe away easily enough and are worth the upgrade to have the smooth, level face. The kindle arrived on Saturday with 70% and is sitting now with daily reading on Tuesday at 48%. So maybe it won’t be weeks of battery, but the battery life seems more than adequate.

It does take longer to wake up, and it feels like the font size is a little off from the previous Kindle. But that could also be my middle-aged eyes!

So for 3 days in, I’m so far very happy. I like the smaller, more compact design. It fits very nicely into my small hip bag for when I don’t want my big purse. No complaints, and I wish I hadn’t put off the upgrade for a few weeks, being skittish due to other reviews."
Consuela,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first paper white. New to the e reader scene, I was happy at the no glare, and customization of font size, spacing, brightness.

The ads do not bother me.

I could love it, if it were not for the battery usage. I charged fully, closed case, set aside, did not use or slide open the device,
For two days. Day three, I discovered the battery charge depleted. This is very disappointing when your preparing to travel."
Ruslan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"1. Books outside Amazon
I like that you can add books outside Amazon.
You should convert it to Kindle format before thought.
You can send the books both via USB and via email (I use Calibre program for that).
You should convert to Kindle's supported format before sending a book via email (.mobi, .azw, .pdf, .html, .doc, .docx, .rtf, .txt, images).
Kindle also supports a modern KFX format. It has more font and layout options that MOBI and thus is more comfortable for reading. You can convert your books to KFX BUT you can't send them via email as documents. You have to transfer them via USB. And it's the only option.

2. Durable
I dropped it a few times and it feels very durable. Didn't do any major crash tests though.

3. Outdated wireless connectivity
Kindle doesn't support WIFI 5 (also known as 802.11ac). I usually don't use old WiFi 4 to avoid its interference with Bluetooth, so it's a problem for me. I temporarily enable WiFi 4 on my router specifically for Kindle.
Kindle uses outdated Bluetooth 4.1 LE, thought it was common to use Bluetooth 4.2 LE in 2017 and Bluetooth 5.0 by the end of 2018.

4. Outdated wired connectivity
microUSB should be replaced via USB-C. The last one is much more durable and is used by literally everything nowadays. Laptops, phones, headphones, wireless speakers. microUSB feels like echo from the past and still exist on only on a few old devices.

The rating would be 5 if Kindle would support KFX over email and had its connectivity improved (WiFi 5 is a must for a modern device)."
Brian,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first dedicated ebook reader. I’ve been reading on my phones and iPads for years. Within the past several months, at age 44, I was forced to acknowledge that my distance vision is shot, and now I’m wearing glasses to drive and whatnot, which I’m not real crazy about. So even though I think it’s pretty ridiculous to have a dozen different electronic devices floating around, when my phone pretty much does every single thing that all of the others do but in a single device, the reading experience on the Kindle Paperwhite, with the backlight turned all the way off, is pretty darn good. The effect is no different than reading print on paper. In the short time I’ve been reading on my Kindle, I gotta tell you, I think my distance vision is already improving. (Lighted screens used up close apparently cause the shape of your eye to change over time.) So yes, the reading experience on the Kindle Paperwhite, with the light turned completely off, is a great reading experience, and I believe I’m already experiencing positive vision benefits from it. IF you are a person who is going to buy the Kindle and use the backlight, but you already have an iPad or other tablet, I would say do not bother. What’s the point? The effect with the backlight on is no different than reading from any other tablet."
Don W,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is lighter than my old one and the back light allows me to read in lower light conditions. However the battery life is much less than my older kindle. I have set the back ground light at level 10 and have the airplane mode set to not have the wifi running all of the time and I still only get about 5 days of battery life. My old kindle would run for 30-40 days. Even if I do not use my kindle for several days he battery continues to run down.

In the description for this kindle it said you should get 20-30 days of battery life and that is no nearly correct.

When you turn the kindle on it takes several seconds for it to start up were as the old one as soon as you pushed the on button it was ready for use immediately."
JZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When you hit the button to turn off the screen it later turns itself on in your bag without anything touching the power button. My unit’s battery is always near dead and is worthless to me when I need it. Whispersync doesn’t allow you to download purchases when there is no WiFi available, even though this was available in older versions. I’m sorry I ever bought this dog. I had anticipated using Bluetooth as well to listen to Audible. But the way it switches itself on and kills the battery, I may go back to my old version. This unit is terrible and apparently Amazon sees no reason to offer fixes or solutions. Do yourself a favor and pass on this model. I was busy on business travel and now I’m passed the return period. Guess I got screwed. Thanks Amazon."
Melissa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my kindle, and my paperwhite stopped working finally so I bought this one. I'm very happy with it. It has some cool new features and I like that you can invert the screen. The battery life however, does not last ""weeks"" I read a lot, hours at a time sometimes, down time at work, relaxing at home. So I honestly didn't expect it to. It really depends on how much you actually use it. A charge for me is lasting a little over a week though and with pretty heavy use at that. So it's really not a draw back, but I wouldn't say weeks. I love that you can customize your reading experience a little more. I have zero complaints."
Luis S.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I took advantage of Prime day and trade in my old Kindle Paperwhite (gen 5th), which was working ok but a little bit slow for my taste and I would like to see if the new lighting, more memory and Bluetooth. This new one works great and it is faster than the old I had. Lighting is better too. I saw several reviews talking about issues and glares, but mine is really fine. The new flat surface is nice too.
As I stated in my first kindle review, the kindle has a good value proposition for me, being great to read in any light situation, easy on my eyes, light, ease to carry it around, and long battery life. However I only bought them when in a promotion. I don't see the benefits to have a $129 value. I really like my kindle, but you can buy a tablet for less then that. I believe it is overpriced but this is what promotions are for."
Stitchwiz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new Kindle paperwhite. It replaced my 1st edition paperwhite. It is lighter, slightly smaller (although the screen is the same size), and simple to operate. The large storage ensures that I can keep my library handy wherever I go. I like being able to read it near water. The only reason I don’t give it 5 stars is that the battery life seems less than optimal. Reading continuously for 5 hours drains the battery by half. That is substantially less battery allowance than the advertising suggests. It worries me that it won’t last for a long international flight without a recharge. Since I replaced my last Kindle because the battery was running low, I feel like I didn’t really solve that problem."
moxie mainer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an avid reader I don't know why I waited so long to get an e reader! I guess it's hard to convince someone like me who so enjoys the smell and feel of books to believe they are a feasible alternative to real books! But with the price of printed books rising so high that I could not afford to read as much as I liked, and lets face it My old eyes don't see as good as they used too, I took the plunge, and am I glad I did! There are many free or really affordable books on Amazon, and the ability to adjust the text size and the backlighting, and the waterproofing, makes for such an enjoyable read, anywhere you want, whether it be in bed, or drifting around in my kayak! And if you have a touch of arthritis, the light weight, and easy page turn, brings back the ability to read for hours without discomfort. Thank you Amazon for providing this wonderful product!"
High Words,1.0 out of 5 stars,"(1) Holding this thing is a bit odd, whether you use the back strap one-handed or not. or not.
(2) Having the ""power"" button on the bottom is like no other device I have owned and I repeatedly hit it, not on purpose even though I know it is there.
(3) What? You have to manually instruct it to flip to horizontal versus vertical reading orientation? Other devices have automatic spatial orientation.
(4) The gray/blue screen is not good to read with. Even turning the brightness to full does not make it white enough.
(5) the battery life before recharge is not nearly as much as I was led to believe ( and yes, even with wifi off)
(6) The touch screen keyboard at times needs to be pounded to respond.
(7) there is more ( or less, depending on how you look at it)"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,It took me a few years after the Kindle came out to switch over from real book because I love the feel and smell of a book. The plus side to the Kindle is being able to turn off the lights and read in the dark and I'm never ever without a book which is a huge plus for a book nerd like me. The only thing I would suggest for the Kindle Paperwhite is that they make them to where you can turn the background to black as you can on the Kindle Fire so that reading at night is easier on your eyes and you don't disturb your spouse with a screen light.
Purple Iris,3.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: Kristina from Amazon Tech Support called me within an hour of posting my review. She wanted to understand my concerns about the product and provide what help she could. As a result of the conversation, it was determined that at least one of my issues with the Kindle was something that should not be happening, and so a replacement is being sent. I will update my review again next week.

1) I wish the contrast was higher. Even at the brightest setting the font looks like gray rather than black. For older eyes, it makes reading more difficult. I've seen at least one other reviewer that says the same thing.
2) I don't like the ""flash"" (inversion of pixels) that occurs periodically, such as the beginning of a new chapter.
3) the battery life isn't great. As other reviewers mentioned, you have to turn off WiFi to get any kind of battery life."
Paul A. Shaffer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very happy with my Kindle. The size is perfect and the back light means I can read it practically anywhere. The battery life is truly impressive.

I've gotten back into reading because the Kindle is so easy on my eyes and easy to add new books. I still haven't figured out how to add overdrive and other services but I expect it should be fairly simple.

I would recommend going through any documentation since some of the navigation is a bit confusing. I haven't yet and I'm regretting it.

I only have one complaint which is fairly minor. I received my Kindle as a gift for the holidays. When I went to order a cover for it it was incredibly difficult to identify which kindle version I had. The lettering on the back of the kindle is impossible to actually read. I finally got the number by using my phone to take a picture, zooming in, and altering the contrast so I could finally identify which Kindle case I needed to order. It was much more difficult than it needed to be.

I love mine and I recommend it to anyone. Especially to anyone who likes to read and has any age related vision issues."
carl ridge,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a long time kindle reader, my favorite was the kindle keyboard. The paperwhite screen is not the same screen the other kindles have. It is not as clear or as easy on the eyes as earlier models were. To be honest I am not a big fan of touch screens and this one one reinforces my opinion. As for battery life, if you turn everything off then battery life is great, but if you you use the back lite and other features to read as we do. Battery life is days not months. As always the kindle is a blessing to have and use. But this model is not the best thing since sliced bread that you are making it to be. Earlier models beat this model to pieces as a reader. Smaller, lighter and waterproof do not make a better reader, the lite is a nice touch, but the so called improved screen makes the lite a necessity not a asset. I am disappointed in your offering this time and that has never happened before. From a long time owner, user and fan of the Kindle e-reader."
M. Schneider,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great product but I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn’t like the special offers and paid the one-time fee to remove them. Without the special offers, it’s definitely a 5 star product. The special offers are on the lock screen and you have to swipe up from the bottom of the page to unlock it. Unfortunately, there is a “Read Now” button near the bottom of the lock screen and it would be easy to accidentally hit that and buy whichever book is being advertised while trying to unlock the device.
I upgraded my fifth generation Kindle with this and I am happy with this, so far, especially with the extra storage since the older Kindle had almost reached its limit. I traded in the older device and received a discount on the new one as well as credit for the trade in."
currymung,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been seven years since I purchased my first Amazon Kindle and really I didn't need a new one. My 2012 Kindle Touch was working fine and I successfully finished my English major requirements five years ago. I'm a sucker for deals, though, and Amazon's trade-in offer and promotional 25% off discount got me hook, line, and sinker. I reasoned that my old Kindle's dwindling battery life was justification enough for this purchase and I want to read more this year.

Some major changes for anyone considering an upgrade from an older version:

- The Kindle Paperwhite's backlight is pretty useful for reading in dimly lit settings. The backlight is automatically on when the device powers on for the first time, however, there's the option of turning it off entirely.
- A noteworthy design change is that the screen now sits flush against the black border. It looks sleeker, and the actual Kindle Paperwhite is thinner.
- Wowza, there is BLUETOOTH. I still find myself connecting to Audible on my cellphone way more than the Paperwhite, but having the option to is nice.

Overall, I'm quite happy with my upgrade and I think you would be too!"
SAM,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Paperwhite is lighter and a bit brighter. It's still an excellent e-reader. However, I find the page turn overly sensitive and inadverrant off button pushes maddening. It's surprisingly slow to WAKE compared to my last Paperwhite model. The thing j miss the most is hand-in-glove fit of the prior leather case. The new case attaches the the corners whereas the prior model nested neatly in the case and the cover folds flat against the back when open. The new cover stands off on the right side. The older model with cover feels more premium compared to the new one. Subjectively the battery also seems to go flat sooner.

This may be my 4th Paperwhite. After a couple of years +/- the battery will poop out. In my last upgrade I didn't have to buy a new case. You do for this model."
Marla,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle keyboard would no longer hold a charge, so I was forced to get a new one. I used the trade-in feature for the gift card and the discount on a new Paperwhite. I love my new Paperwhite -- it's so much smaller and lighter than my old Kindle keyboard. Also, the e-ink screen, even with the light turned all the way down, is much whiter than my old Kindle. The light is also great, such an improvement over the case with a pull-out light, which was my previous arrangement. Overall, I'm very happy with it.

It does have a few issues, though. The most annoying one is that it frequently jumps ahead a few pages when I close the cover, or sometimes even when I turn a page. I regularly have to swipe back and find my place again. Even worse, once it sent me back to the beginning of a book when it woke up. This is very annoying.

The touch screen could use some work. It isn't as responsive as I would like, and it often misses my gestures, especially the poke or whatever to get a word definition. I miss the page turn buttons of my old Kindle Keyboard.

The power button is badly placed -- if you prop the kindle up on something (a table, your lap, whatever), it either turns off or worse flickers between turning off and on. If I remember correctly, the old Kindle Keyboard's power button was a slide mechanism, not an actual button. I wish they had kept that arrangement if they were going to stick the button on the bottom.

The battery doesn't seem to be as long-lived as my old Kindle Keyboard, even in airplane mode and with the illumination turned down to nothing. I could easily go two weeks without a charge on my old one, to the point that I wouldn't even pack the charge cable when I took it on vacation. That isn't possible with the new one, though. It is still good for maybe a week of heavy reading, though. I can live with that.

I see that 11 years later, the web browser is still 'experimental' (not that I ever used it, except in desperation), but it's funny that they still call it that. I guess it's Amazon-speak for a 'browser of last resort' capability."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product a lot, very convenient and light to carry around. I got the fabric cover which I love. The back light is awesome reading at night when the wife is sleeping. The battery life is not as great as advertised if you keep the wifi on. The operating system at times is a little slow especially changing from the car Bluetooth hookup to my headset. Besides that with a little patience and turning the wife on when needed only the product works well, it is awesome for the price."
Darlene Lindner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After having it for 3 months and using it a lot I must say that it’s disappointing Not being able to go on the internet with it.
It’s kind of irritating having to go on my iPad or computer and have them send the book to my Paperwhite.
On the plus side, because I use it in the pool, I’m loving that it is water resistant, non-glare, and I’m able to read in direct sunlight.
Another plus side is the size which fits easily in my purse.
I guess I just want it more and expect too much."
Never to old for fantasy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love kindle and the paperwhite is great as I can read in the dark, hubby can sleep and very little light comes from device. Page turning is silent and screen also works perfectly in bright daylight. Just bought a new one to replace 2.5 year old PW that stopped working. Frankly, it just up and quit in the middle of a page of reading which seems pretty lame and Amazon offered to give me a whole 25% off of a new one if I purchased it on the phone while I was working with tech support. The fact that there isn't even a software update download or something is pretty lame as well. Try to reset with the power button and if that doesn't work, you're SOL. Well, there isn't a better alternative so I bought a new one, it arrived, went to put the old case on and FFS the case doesn't fit. A couple of mm here and there. Now I need a new case. Crap like this makes me hate Amazon and I am a VERY good customer. Still using Amazon but certainly thinking hard and will opt for other vendors. We see you Amazon. Be better."
Greg K,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, I'm satisfied with this Kindle. However, there are two things I don't particularly care for. First, the power button is on the bottom edge of the unit. That means that I have to take extra care to make sure that I put that end into the storage sleeve first when storing it whenever I'm not going to be using it for awhile. Otherwise, I run the risk of inadvertently turning the unit on without knowing it and draining power.

The second thing I don't care for is the fact that this unit no longer has the list view function for the library/collections. Everything is now in grid view which means that it takes more work to determine how many books you have ""checked out"" under the Kindle Unlimited program. That said, list view is available but only when adding books to a collection."
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery drains completely overnight. I called customer service and they informed me that the screen brightness needs to be below 15 and the wifi needs to be turned off. So...... I upgraded to a new devise to lose the best features. I never turn off my wifi on my older Paperwhite and the battery can last a week (and I can read with a brighter page). Sadly, my older one is starting to have connection issues. I now need to decide if I will keep this one and deal with a much worse product."
E,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had almost every kindle generation since the first. Although the screen on this version was very nice and it is helpful to have some extra water resistance, this generation of Kindle was disappointing on several fronts: 1) The power button is on the bottom rim. When I prop this up to read it, for example on a table, it shuts itself off because the button is on the bottom. It can even do this in some stands. This is a surprising design flaw, as earlier versions had the power button on the side, top or back. 2) The battery life is less than earlier versions I have had. I used to be able to go more than a week with frequent daily reading but this is no longer the case.

I do hope an improved version is in the wings."
David N,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Three weeks ago we could not get the unit to open after charging. Then 5or6 days later it did open. It was charged again, and again it would not open. We tried many different cables to no avail.
It was purchased in Dec. as a Christmas present. It was brought to Europe on our vacation in March and was a great disappointment.
Help"
Beth,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I do love my Kindle Paperwhite. But it's perpetual frustration that Amazon hasn't upgraded to a faster processor. I would happily buy an Oasis if it had a faster processor where you touch a word and you instantly see the dictionary definition or to highlight, find, etc. But apparently the processor is just as slow as on the Paperwhite. I don't like to have to wait a second or so. A faster processor would solve the issue.
This is less important, but I would love for paperwhite to provide an easy way to sort and store my books into categories and folders.
It makes it hard to find if I want to recommend a book to others or keep all my books of a certain type together in a group, or remember an author or whatever"
Just Me,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I have been using a Kindle reader since the Kindle Keyboard days, which was a while ago.
I inherited a family member's Kindle Touch when they got a Fire HD. Needless to say, I was
extremely happy with both the previous devices but was tired of having to use a snake light
with batteries to read at night since both my devices weren't made with the built-in backlight.
I decided to upgrade to the new Kindle Paperwhite 2019 and LOVE it! It's so much smaller
and slimmer than the Touch and fits inside my tiny purse. Battery life isn't quite as good as
the 2 months standby I would get on my Keyboard or Touch, but I knew it wouldn't be with
the addition of the built in backlight. I turn on Airplane mode to receive the best battery life, as leaving the Bluetooth and WIFI constantly on will delete any battery faster. I purchased the 8GB version (which was double the storage on both my other devices) and I had over 200 books stored on them with over half my storage left. This
new device should easily hold over 1000 ebooks with no problem! Please be aware that if for
any reason you need to restore your device to factory settings, it will remove the VoiceView audio
capability in the Accessibility Settings. To restore functionality, you will need to download the
correct file and transfer it over via the usb cable to the root drive of the Paperwhite. Here is the
link should anyone need it. http://www.amazon.com/help/kindlevoicefiles

Hope you enjoy your Paperwhite as much as I have. I think you'll be happy with your purchase. If
you are looking for a case, I would recommend the Ayotu Water-Safe Leather case for the Kindle Paperwhite.
I got the 2018 version for $7.99 and it fits beautifully."
rainbownaty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to have the entry level kindle from a couple of years ago and I was thinking of buying the new version of the same entry level Kindle the one just released that has light and everything but even when they improved that version I considered this one to be the best option for me and I was not wrong. I love this Kindle, the most important change for me is the the 300 px screen which is amazing when reading comics or even books with a tinier letter size, it works great. Just that was valuable enough for me cause I use to have a hard time with the one I had before. Also, the other day we experienced a power outage and I was really happy to know I had at least my kindle to read in the dark with an outstanding battery life that was not going to leave me without something to do. If you buy it, this one or any other version, I assure you you won't regret your purchase. This is just an amazing gadget that we all need to have. Once you go kindle never go back."
cowboy2,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The product came in Russian Language and could not get it to reset to English.Called tech support and we were on the phone for 3 hours and everything we tried failed. They finally said they would send another one out and I return this one. The next day I just started pushing buttons and clicking on things and all of a sudden it asked me what language I wanted, clicked English and it was set. I still returned it because I was afraid it might go back again. the new one works great and seems to be even faster so I am happy with the new one. Just be careful when first turning on and setting up that you don't push the wrong button, on off switch is at bottom and is easily turned off this can cause a problem when setting up"
Joseph A. Corona,4.0 out of 5 stars,"What an upgrade from using my phone as a kindle, that's great for an emergency, but as a real reader this smokes it !
8gb holds more than 100 books as far as I can tell ( plenty for me and it's fairly easy to manage ).
If the OS was a good as the hardware from a reading stand point I'd give it 5 stars.
The OS feels slow, less responsive and clunky compared to other modern tablet/phones etc.
I am not an software engineer but I'd be willing to bet it's the OS not the hardware that lags behind.
All that said my reading pleasure is greatly increased with this device.
If you're looking for a nicely sized reader that lasts forever on a charge & is super easy on the eyes ( strain wise ) I can't see how you can go wrong, especially for the relatively small investment."
Shannon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a previous Kindle paperwhite that was about 5 years old. It was working just fine but I really wanted the waterproof option because I do take it to the beach and bring it around pools. I haven't gotten it wet but I like the fact that I don't have to worry about an accidental drop in the water now with my new one. One of the nice things about the new paperwhite is that there is no lip between the screen and the sides of the device. I used to get sand trapped in that lip and it would drive me crazy. It's now smooth. I know it sounds like I a minor thing but its a major one for me. I also love how light this new device is. My purse was weighted down with the old one. I love it! I gave my daughter my old kindle and I can share my library with her. I love my new Kindle Paperwhite. It was actually given to me as a gift and it was by far my favorite Christmas gift!!
Mary Adams,3.0 out of 5 stars,I’m so disappointed with this purchase. My old kindle has a keyboard and the buttons on the side to change pages. This new paperwhite is so small and when you swipe to the next page it flashes to the screen with the black background. It’s annoying. I bought it to be able to read outside. But I would rather struggle with the light issues on my iPhone or iPad. The reading experience is much better then on the kindle. It gets such rave reviews but I just have to send it back. It doesn’t work for me.
John Pyers,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a massive value for a very solid reader! The Paperwhite has been the standard e-Ink reader for almost a decade, and after a few years of the same production model, the new 2018 (10th Generation) sets yet another New Standard! The 10th Generation Paperwhite is waterproof, features more memory, and supports Audible via Bluetooth headsets. I'm impressed that this Paperwhite is very responsive and can hold my extensive eBook collection as well as several unabridged Audible books comfortably. Magazine support appears to have been expanded.

Everything runs flawlessly - and I love being able to have the clock displayed at the top of my page while I'm reading a book. I no longer have to pause reading to see that I'm late for an appointment!

The screen, now flush with the bezel, and the slightly lighter and thinner frame is easy to hold and easy to use one-handed. There aren't enough good words for the new Paperwhite!

Thank you Amazon!"
Bridget,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Kindle Paperwhite because it was so light-weight. I knew it was basic, but I only use my Kindle for reading, so I thought it would be fine. It might be for some people, but not me. My biggest complaint is the touch screen is not very responsive. You swipe to open. It often takes two or three swipes before it recognizes you want to open it. Likewise you swipe to turn pages. Sometimes it moves to the next page easily and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes after doing nothing it moves forward several pages.
In addition, the home page is difficult to read. The titles are written in small font and can't be enlarged. Even with glasses I sometimes can't read the title. I wish I had returned it, but have been too busy with teaching from home to even think of it. I wish I had not purchased this and I would not buy it again.
I would definitely not buy this again!"
Noreen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 2nd Paperwhite, had to buy another since the built in light went dim on my first one. I also have a Kindle Fire. Love the Paperwhite for reading. While the Fire worked fine, I find the Paperwhite charges faster & holds the charge longer while reading. Same features as my old Paperwhite, i.e, you control the brightness & font. the only problem I'm having is with the touchscreen. If I don't tap the screen just so the ""home"" box appears on top. It's a bit annoying. Other than that it's great!"
Matthew Cassidy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"IT DOES NOT HAVE AN AUDIO JACK FOR HEADPHONES.

I had bought this with some birthday money to find out it had no headphone jack. I must have missed that in the description, that's on me. However, I had to spend over an hour talking to the IT on how to pair headphones to it. That right there is too much to unbox in this review, so I will leave it at this. To get your kindle to read to you. Once you have paired bluetooth headphones to it. Go into settings, click more settings, click accessibility, there you will find voice view, click on voice view, it will take you to a new page, lastly turn on voice view. The directions the kindle gives are poor and inadequate to causing the voice to activate on it's own. If you do it manually, it will save you a lot of heart ache. Once you get used to starting it manually, it works like a dream."
NB,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 8GB Paperwhite as an upgrade from an old Kindle I was using that worked just fine but did not have a lighted screen. The lighted screen is a definite advantage. While it is not glare free as advertised, it is very readable. The Paperwhite was advertised as being able to hold 1000's of books. I bought one book and took advantage of the free audio download to give it a try and now my Paperwhite is three quarters full. Also, the touch screen does not always respond and it does not stay charged as long as my old Kindle did. I bought the leather Amazon cover which, when compared to my old Amazon cover, is cheap with a thin glued on leather veneer that feels more like plastic and I expect will not wear very well. Overall, I expected more from Amazon."
Blue Note Jazz Fan,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had this for several months now, and overall, I have decidedly mixed opinions. Due to a combination of sales and rebates, I actually paid about $35 for the 8GB version. Is it worth $35? Yes, I think so. Is it worth the full asking price? Not to me.

Pros
Lightweight
Easy on the eyes

Cons
The battery charge claims “weeks, not hours.” Hm. Maybe if you never use the background light, and read 30 min. a day. I’m an avid reader, and I tend to use the backlight most of the time. A full charge lasts me about 4 days. Better than my iPad. Definitely not weeks.
Browser/link functionality
I get it, this is intended as a dedicated e-reader. Fine. But, still, the browser functionality is, apparently, the same “beta” or “experimental” browser that my 1st generation Kindle contained, what, 7-10 years ago? It’s slow, clunky, monochromatic, and generally worthless. I don’t even tend to open a Wikipedia article entry with it, unless 8 have time to kill and want to continually scroll/resize the screen to read it
Illustrations
The reader is monochromatic (black and white). Illustrations, book covers, etc. are, therefore, B&W. Furthermore, illustrations can not be enlarged as they can be using the Kindle iPad app.
Page turns
The grip edges are small, so it’s easy to accidentally hit the screen and temporarily lose your place in the text, either forward or backward. There is a function to disable this, and supposedly turn pages with a swipe gesture. This worked the first time on my device and never since. Also, in order to re-enable the touch screen capability, you have to turn the Kindle on/off. Sheesh.

All in all, it does one thing pretty well: display black and white text. And it is light/small/easy to hold. That’s it. However much that is worth to you, that’s what you should pay."
K. Grosdidier,2.0 out of 5 stars,My old kindle was getting glitchy after a few years so I decided to upgrade to the new version. I must say I’m disappointed. The battery life lasts only 4-5 DAYS instead of 3-4 WEEKS that my old version lasted. It’s a bit less glitchy but I’m having issues with it downloading kindle prime books. I’m not appreciating this “upgraded” model!
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the new paperwhite. This is my 4th Kindle, 2nd paperwhite. This kindle is much lighter than the previous model. The screen is now smooth all the way to the edge, making for a smoother appearance. The new font options add to your experience as well. The screen is glossier to touch and very well lit. I was on the fence about getting this version as the description wasn’t that much different than my previous version. I’m so glad that I did!"
Ronald Remmel,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've read dozens of books on Kindles; I love the large type, easy on my geriatric eyes, and the portability. My new waterproof Kindle is ideal for the bathtub! I love to download books almost instantly via wi-fi from Amazon. However, the touch screen is almost impossible to manipulate. Often something bad happens when I bump the screen. I find it virtually impossible to get to the home page in order to purchase new books.
The Kindle needs buttons, like on my computer!
Ronald S. Remmel, Ph.D."
PRPro,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so excited to upgrade my older Kindle paperwhite - particularly because the new one is waterproof (and I like to read while soaking in the tub). It's going back after just one day. First the built in light. At maximum lighting, it's not as bright as my old Kindle - in fact, it's somewhat dark - almost like the blue light is reduced for night vision. Second, the print (font and color). While I know you can change the font, size, and bold/non-bold within the actual book, I noticed a big difference between my old Kindle's home page versus that of this new Kindle. The font was not as black (more like gray) and was not as sharp. Lastly, the battery life is exactly what others have been saying. While it certainly didn't drain to zero in one day, it did; however, drain much more than the original. Thanks, but I'll keep the old Kindle."
C.TSB,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall a great device. This is my third paperwhite. The battery life was the best on the first one I had. The second one I bought was only because the first was getting older and the battery wasn't lasting as long anymore. I'd only charge it once a month, maybe less.

I easliy read 30+ hours a week. That being said, the gen 10 battery only lasts me a week, maybe two before I have to recharge it. I keep the brightness at 7 or below amd leave the bluetooth off. I keep the wifi on, but I always kept the wifi on pn both my previous models. I don't understand why the battery dies so fast, it's quite disappointing.

I do like the fact that the entire front is all screen, no seem. It's also a little smaller and a little lighter, which is nice since I spend so many hours with it."
Dianna W,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had every version of Kindle since they came out. Paperwhite is my favorite, and I was so excited that this one could go in the water with me for vacations, but I am truly disappointed in this product.

The battery life is the worst of any Kindle I’ve ever had.

The screen always seems dim.

It seems very touchy in terms of moving back and forth between pages, and highlights when I don’t want to.

Amazon needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. The original Paperwhite is far better!"
sage,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My old original Kindle started dying and because of aging eyes, cataracts, etc. decided to upgrade to white with lighting. Find these to be valuable features. Since I read several hours per day would like even better battery life but we can't have it all. Bought the cover which I consider a must and like how it automatically turns off the Kindle when you close it--just trying to develop the discipline to remember to close it when I set it down which will help with battery life. Not sure I like the promos but easy to click past as I solely download library sourced books and rarely purchase. Overall, happy with my new Kindle only wish it hadn't gone on sale for Valentine's Day the week or so after my purchase!!"
Bill R,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle. The first one was a plain basic Kindle and worked reasonally well for severaal years before it died. Then I got my first Paperwhite Kindle, and it kept flipping pages on it's own, even laying flat on a table, so returned it for credit and bought another one. The second Paperwhite Kindle still is not working well, books that are in my library won't download and allow reading, without having to call Customer Service and have them resend the book. Also it goes from not turning pages to having them flipp several at a time. NOT SAATISFACTORY AT ALL!!!!!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was delighted to have a 32G unit available - When I travel and/or go camping, I don't want to even think about where I might find wifi, so love taking my entire ebook and audible libraries with me.
I'm not finding a battery problem. So far, I've only used it for books. Beginning tonight, I'll be using it for audiobooks as well (Audible), but it will have to really be bad to use battery as fast as a tablet .
I have a set of Bluetooth ear buds that had paired to my Kindle Fire with no problem, so I was at a loss to have them NOT pair with my new paperwhite. I (finally) phoned Amazon Customer Support today, and the patient and good-humored woman who took my call, stayed with me and walked me through a couple of different techniques until we got it to work! Thank you, ACS, I've very impressed."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I replaced my 7th generation PW for the New PW and this one is so much better!
The touchscreen is smooth and and responds faster and easier. The glare everyone complains about is not a big deal- nothing that will bother you to read and I tried it outdoor, indoor, dark room- the reading experience was great.
About fingerprints- there’s a little but again, nothing serious that can affect the reading.
For me, as a non native English speaker, the audio option is great and help me to learn how to pronounce words right. I could have been more happier if I had an option like it has on the Kindle App to tap a word and hear how to pronounce it. This option is not available on Kindle PW, the 2 option are- audiobooks and turning on the VoiceView Screen Reader which is kind of annoying and makes the device a little slower."
cameron baethke,2.0 out of 5 stars,"What I like:
It is the perfect size and weight. Love the blue color. Love that there isnt a glare.

What I dislike:
So this is my first kindle...but this is black and white screen with older tech set up. I am struggling to navigate it. It makes since once you get the flow. The book covers are blurred and grainy. I cant seem to find the right setting to read comfortably. I'd love if there was different page colors. The battery is weird- do not let this become died. You will have a white screen of death for an about an hour before it can be used, and it can be difficult to turn it on after.

If you like basic black and white kindle, then this would be perfect for you. If you like the kindle app on your cell phone, then I dont recommend this."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been reading Kindle book's for years now on my phone, Android tablet, and computer screen but I never had a actual Kindle up till now. I will continue to read books on my phone, in waiting rooms, because I'm not going to drag the Kindle reader with me to the doctor or dentist, or the car mechanic. It is a nice way to read a book in the comfort of your home however. I always wondered what the ""Paperwhite"" experience was like. I'm very happy with it."
stentorian,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to this latest version of Kindle Paperwhite on Prime Day. I thought it was a great deal, with trade-in and discounts. Product description has shown that free cellular connectivity is included. But the product arrived only have WiFi. Thought the touchscreen was pretty responsive, but it’s frozen and dead on my at least twice now. It took forever to charge and battery drain is much faster than my old kindle. I will cancel my trade-in, keep my good old kindle paperwhite (7th gen) and return this new thing."
CS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I tend to kill kindles with excessive reading, but I was actually excited when I broke my last one and this was the newest one because it had text to speech (inset angels singing now). Too bad it is not that simple. First off, this doesn't have a speaker on it, so for that feature to work it needs to be connected to Bluetooth. Ok, fine, that's not the worst thing right? Well, then add to the fact that it is annoying to turn on and off (the text to speech I mean) and control. If you use it in the car like I do it can be a PITA to stop it to take a call and then restart it where you where. As for regular reading the only thing I don't like is that you can't rotate the screen and it doesn't have any page turning buttons, so when I am reading in bed at night it can be a little annoying if your arm gets tired. Hopefully the fix the text to speech, its so close to being good."
FlowerPower,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am quite glad I got myself a newer kindle, I had one of the first few generation ones and this blows it completely out of the water. The size, weight, feel, user interface is all amazing. It is pretty simple to figure out, and they also include a pretty nice little user guide for it.

What I liked:
- The highlighting is a great feature and that I am able to save it, change the color of the highlighted section, and come back to it later in my notes is fantastic.
- I liked that it came with my account already logged into the device, it made for a great user experience. I felt like it was mine right out of the box.
- That the charging light changes from yellow to green when its completely charged up. It's a small touch but I really liked that feature.
- Speaking of charging, the battery lasts quite some time. I traveled for a month and had to charge it once.

Some things I would like to see changed, some minor annoyances:
- ADJUSTING THE BRIGHTNESS IS A PAIN. If its dark in the room at night when I grab my kindle, and the brightness is not on at all, I can't see where the hell to press to turn the brightness up or down. To find if I am pressing the right things I have to turn a light on, set the brightness on the kindle to the level I want it, and then turn it off. I feel like a simple button on the top or the bottom of the kindle would go a ways to fixing that.
- The brightness. When I first open my kindle its like looking at the sun when its booting up if it is dark. It would be really nice if it just started up at the brightness setting that it is set at.
- Highlighting things from one page to the next can be tricky, and sometimes re highlighting a section I feel could be easier and not as... jumpy."
Katharine Hong Ng,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this on 11/1/2018. Just over a year and the device is starting to short circuit - screen flashes to blank on and off. Restarts itself without promting. Very disappointed in that a $135 device is wonking out just over a year of light use.
renzoom2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so thrilled for this purchase! As stated, I have RA and love to read. Books were becoming a challenge to hold due to their weight and cramping/ache in my hands and wrists. My first Kindle was a Fire I purchased from a friend, 5-6 years ago. (A purchase that has saved my life and that I didn't know I needed!) I decided to take the plunge to upgrade due to huge storage capacity, light weight unit and PRIME DAY sale. Totally in love!

My only con is that when reading, the screen does NOT rotate. (The case I purchased to ""tent"" on its side, not knowing it, super bummer!!! :-( But, I purchased a FINTIE case that has a ""leg"" like a picture frame to prop upright, and has an elastic ""handle"" to slide hand through for ease of reading while holding! LOVE IT!!)"
MT,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned this produce for slightly more than a year and it failed in the most unexpected and dumbest manner - it could not start because it would not charge a battery that was drained for a couple of months. When I saw the ""battery with exclamation mark,"" I starting charging the Kindle with the original cable. The charging light was orange but after several hours, the exclamation mark was still there, so I used another cable to continue the charging. Again the light was orange. I then pressed the power button for 40 minutes to reset the device. The orange light turned to green light for a moment and then disappeared. Since then, it never lit up.

This was my very first kindle and it really gave me a bad impression of reliability of Amazon products. Other than this kindle, I have never had such problem with other devices, i.e., failure because battery was drained for a couple of months. At most, the battery lifespan may be shortened but it should not cause a total failure.

$100 may seem cheap for a Kindle but be prepared to change kindle very soon after warranty is up."
Jose,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like it but really? Power button where everyone puts theirs pinkie finger? That's its the only thing I don't like about it. Btw it doesn't have the led problem at the button like previous generation. I had Gen 9,the one before this one. The pinkie is the only reason why 4 stars"
RR in DC,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a beautifully designed reader, with many attractive features--a convenient size, lightweight and balanced, adjustable font type and size, matte screen, background light adjustment. I bought it to read primarily newspapers and periodicals but returned it when I found out that I could only obtain my subscriptions through Amazon. I prefer to buy my newspapers from the publishing company, so that they get the full revenue stream. Being stove piped into a tech system is an increasing problem. I urge consumers to complain and insist that tech companies make inter-operable systems.

I bought a Fire 7, an Amazon product and much less expensive, and I can handle my subscriptions directly with the publishing companies."
MST55,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my third or fourth Kindle. It arrived in early December. It died once before but was able to give it CPR (held the on button for several seconds), but this time it just died. I chatted with Technical Service and it will be replaced quickly so that’s good. But I’m being sent a refurbished Kindle. Not happy about that. So maybe I got a lemon - that happens. But I really think it should be replaced with a brand new one since I’ve only had it a short while."
Michelle Paine,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to return because I thought the blue tooth was broken. It won't pair with my echo which is another amazon product and it wouldn't pair with my head phones. the new one won't pair with my echo either. Luckily I bought new head phones and it now pairs with them. I have an older paperwhite and it works great. Just slow when on the internet but I read on it in airplane mode and only turn on the wireless when I want to download a book. The new one plays audible so I was happy to get it and also is water proof so I can read while floating in the pool. However, the audible won't play without some kind of speaker and pairing is iffy at best. I should just return it and get my money back but I think it is too late. It is a little faster when on the wireless and I'll check the waterproof benefit in the summer. A little disapointing."
Paul Hathcox,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the added space for books.

I like that the Kindle is now waterproof so I don't have to worry as much about spills if I've put my Kindle down somewhere near me (after all, we can't read 24/7 right?).

I like the new flush screen now (No places for dust or debris to build up like they could on the older models).

I didn't think I would like having to use Bluetooth for audiobooks but I'm getting used to it.

I would still like longer battery life (I read a LOT each day and audiobooks can also drain the battery too over a period of time) but if that's not possible with current battery technology then if it could charge faster (like some smartphones do) then that would be great too.

The Kindle logo at the bottom seems to bother some users but I don't find that it distracts me.

This was a great purchase."
Marcia Miller,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Have been wanting to buy a Kindle paper white for a long time and finally did. The reader is ok but a warning to others: this does not come with any paper instructions! This led me to look back on Amazon and sure enough there were many books on how to use a paper white if you want to pay more. It took awhile but somehow I dummied into a handbook you can download but I’ll bet many buyers get trapped into buying the “how to” books.
Next I was sent a charger cable that did not fit into the reader. Not having instructions I kept pushing the charger in. I’m glad I stopped pushing when I realized the small end of the charger was bent!!!!! Fortunately I had another cable and that one fit......this led me to believe this reader might be refurbished instead of brand new.........
Finally I’m always amazed when companies come out with electronic devices and sell them knowing the customer will have to pay more money to really get a quality product. For example the reader itself must have a cover to protect it from environmental hazards but this costs extra. Kindle Unlimited cost extra. You can only use the audible reader feature if you have wireless hearing devices that connect with Bluetooth. Bottom line: you will probably spend about $50 more to make it a quality product! The reader is really bare bones......"
Rob,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like reading on my Kindle Paperwhite. I previously owned a 4th generation Kindle (pre-touch screen version) which was good for reading, but the Paperwhite is fantastic. Reading the pages on the Paperwhite truly feels like reading a hard copy of a book.

My only complaint is that the touch screen is a little finicky. Sometimes it takes 2 touches to have the screen react. But trying to touch the 3 dots next to a book title (to hit the book sub-menu) is really tricky - sometimes the book opens, sometimes the sub-menu pops up, but most often, nothing happens. Maybe it is the size of my fingers, but this should work better.

Overall, I am glad I upgraded to the Kindle Paperwhite."
KB,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a Kindle since the first generation. I absolutely adore the Kindle. I am on my second Paperwhite. I had my other for a few years. Nothing was terribly wrong with it, but I got a new one because it's battery life was shortening. I traded it in for the newest version. It's very similar to my old Paperwhite. Lighting is a little better. There are a few new features. The thing I was most excited about was it being waterproof, and the promise of much longer battery life, and I quote, ""weeks."" Since I got my new Paperwhite, I returned it and got another new Paperwhite because the battery life was worse than the Paperwhite I traded in for the new version! I called customer service multiple times after receiving my first new Paperwhite. I tried many processes that were supposed to improve the battery life, but none of them worked. Eventually, they sent me another as an exchange. I have the same problem as before. I lose roughly 10% battery life every day. I read probably an average of one hour or so per day. I still give it 4 stars because I love Kindle so much. The battery life, however, is a HUGE disappointment."
Capm,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my previous paper white Kindle and when it died from overuse, I think, I ordered this new one
Why would you change a product that was wonderful like it was. My old Paperwhite was near perfect
My new Kindle is smaller because margins are narrower. This makes it harder to hold and to hold without hitting a function on the page, which happens often-most annoying-while reading a book
I have had glare on my page that I never had before
The battery is supposed to last longer but I have not found that to be true. In fact I think it may be shorter battery life at times
I’ve used this new product for over a month and had to give you my opinion. Read some reviews and it seems I’m not the only one unhappy with this model Wish I had a choice but sadly no"
CTinCT,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always loved my Kindle 2nd generation and I was torn about upgrading since it still works well. However, I often use my Kindle by my inground pool or at the beach so the fact that the new one is waterproof was a big selling feature. I'm so happy I bought it.

I travel a lot and this new model is thin and light which fits nicely into any purse. While it does have a built-in backlight, I turn it off during the day to avoid eyestrain. The battery isn't as long lasting as I expected, but it does recharge quickly. It also downloads fairly quickly. The browser isn't great, but I don't really use it anyways; I can access Kindle store which is what is important. Overall, it's a great ereader. Hopefully it lasts as long as my original one.

It came within the time frame and was packaged well.

I did not receive any discounts for my review."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to love this Kindle but there are several problems with it. I upgraded from a very old Kindle (before paperwhite) so I’m not sure what the earlier paperwhites were like but this one is a little disappointing.

First of all, they advertise that it is waterproof but the papers that come in the box say that is it just splash resistant and water should be avoided.

Second, at the rate the battery is going I don’t think there is any way that it will last weeks as advertised. It came over halfway charged and I had to charge it after about 3 days use. When I did charge it, I struggled to plug it in as the cable did not seem to fit quite right. I worry that something in the port or in the cable will break as a result.

There is also a glitch with page turning. Sometimes when I tap to change the page it does nothing but when I tap again it jumps two pages ahead and I have to backtrack. It’s annoying.

Probably not returning because my old one is no longer functional but I don’t think I would recommend it."
Dorothy Neville,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was an early adopter to the kindle and this is my third one. However, I really migrated to using the kindle app on my iPad mini. I love that use case. However, that's not great for reading outdoors. And my iPad is getting old and the battery doesn't last. And I wanted something lighter; smaller and waterproof are both pluses. So I splurged on this Kindle. I do like it, I like the battery life, the size and the ease. However I really dislike the user interface and very much miss the interface of the kindle app on iPad. It's difficult to browse around in a book, to go back a few pages to reread something and then jump back to where you were. It's finicky about where to touch to move forward or back or to access the settings.

So, that just feels clumsy, clunky and pretty much is the same as my first kindle from way back when."
Susan Blackmon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In 2010, I purchased a Kindle Pearl Ink and have LOVED it. I have arthritis and my hands cramp when I hold a book for very long, Kindle solved that problem because it laid in my hands vs holding a book open. So, I loved the Pearl Ink, it was light weight, easy to hold, great battery life, I was very sad when after eight years it stopped holding a charge. I finally broke down and ordered the new Kindle Paperwhite. Wow! It's amazing. The overall size is about the same as the reading pane on the old Pearl Ink. The built in lighting is great if you want to read in low light or in a dark room. I really like that it learns my reading speed and tells me how much time is left in the chapter/book. I guess the only negative thing I could say is that if you don't turn on airplane mode, the battery gets low much faster than the old Pearl Ink did, I'm sure that has to do with the screen light. If you remember to turn on airplane mode when you're not downloading or syncing, the battery lasts a long time and it charges very quickly. I have mine in a case and it's super light and easy to hold."
Coconut,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love reading on it, but it has no clock. People with bad vision need a clock. I read at lunch and I have to go back to work at a very specific time. I don't want to have to touch the not so great touch screen to know what time it is. The Kindle app for my phone manages to allow me put the clock on it. It also doesn't tell me when my library books are due, which I can't remember on my own, so I have to check my library account many times in the course of a lending period. When I was about to run out of time I borrowed the same book from another library and the Kindle told me my book was expired and took it off my phone and I had to go get it again. Overdrive seamlessly replaces the expiring copy with the newer version when I do that with it (and gives me a clock). But, reading on the Kindle is wonderfully comfortable and peaceful and I am not distracted by the lure of the Internet and notifications. It is also a nice size for my hand. The iPad mini was a bit big, was uncomfortable and it dropped out of my hand a lot. They're both about equal for page turning. I think the Kindle may even be a little better for left-handed page turning."
Clyde,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Unable to charge the Kindle, the enclosed cord will not plug into the port. Seems like a quality control issue. Amazon is replacing the device, I will update this review once I receive a replacement and I am actually able to use it."
Jen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant to buy a kindle just because I'm very attached to having an actual book in my hands, VERY attached. That being said, I was talked into buying this and I'm so glad! When i first turned it on and turned the brightness all the way down it looked like a book being held up against a piece of glass. I love using my paperwhite for traveling, checking out books from the library when i don't want to leave the house (or the library doesn't have a hard copy), and reading in the tub/pool. It's great having something so handy i can just stick in my purse and always have with me (since it's not my phone there's not as many distractions so it makes it easier to focus). The battery life is excellent! If you're on the fence, just bite the bullet and get one, you won't regret it. The ads only show up when it's sleeping so don't bother paying extra for the no ads version!"
Vicki L. Devico,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an avid reader and need to have a book with me at all times. The Kindle Paperwhite is an ideal size to fit into my purse. Up until now, I've been using the Kindle App on my Samsung tablet, which I really like. I think the functionality of the app is more user friendly than the actual Kindle, though. It's not easy to find different settings on the Kindle...even after I've used a function once already. An example of that is the orientation--portrait or landscape. I had changed my orientation to landscape and then it took me quite a while to figure out how to change it back. Also, if I play with settings, or check out my library, I have to remember what I was reading because there's no instant return to the current read. BUT...those are items for the programers/engineers to work on. I love the size and convenience of my Paperwhite!"
Bikerlady,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 5th Kindle. I love Kindle and I really love this Paperwhite, with a small exception. I find the touch screen too difficult particularly if you want to go back a page or if you want to go from page to page in your library. Also, I don't like the off button on the bottom, I tend to hit it accidentally while I am reading and turn off my screen. I preferred it on the back top corner as it was in my prior Kindle Voyager. But, the Paperwhite is much easier to read than any other Kindle I have had. It is great on the beach in bright sunlight or in bed at night in dim light. Much easier on the eyes, not like the previous versions which were like reading off a computer screen and tended to be hard on the eyes. For this reason alone, this is a great Kindle."
mirty,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Let down.
Books show up better on Kindle application and the photos there are in color . Photos on paper white are flat and colorless.
The screen is tiny. Smaller than you think. I’m very disappointed with the paperwhite. And I’m out $100.
I feel I’ve thrown good money down the drain with the purchase of the paperwhite.
This was a Christmas present to Myself. Bah humbug!!"
2000-VMax,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Paper white and I owned a Nook before that. I just upgraded from my 2015 version Paperwhite for ~$42.50 and I have no regrets. The new version does seem to collect finger prints but that is easily delt with just by occasionally wiping it with a soft cloth or even on my t-shirt.
I also have not had any issues with pin holes or dead pixels. It also came with newer software than my old Paperwhite and even updated again a few days ago.
I haven't had any issues with battery life either. I read for at least 2 hours a day and it seems to be on par with my last Paperwhite as far as battery life is concerned.
All in all it just feels like a lighter version of my old Paperwhite and IMO that's a good thing.
I would definitely recommend this version if you upgrade from the previous version like I did."
Steve A,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is NOT an upgrade from earlier paperwhites, in my opinion. It is waterproof/resistant and plays audible books and has more storage. But those improvements do not out weigh the downsides. 1) it takes awhile to wake up. Kindles should just be ready to read, like a book. Why is this worse? 2) Battery life is significantly worse than earlier models. 3) loading your library on the device is a hassle and puts everything in the wrong order. 4) Active content like sudoku is not supported. 5) the smooth, no edge screen is not necessarily better than the earlier one. I'd rather keep my old kindle, have a longer battery life, play sudoku when I want to, find my books easily and not spend extra money for a disappointing product. C'mon Amazon! You can do better!"
Carol,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle because I was having a hard time charging my second one. I love the paper whites and so far (2 weeks} I do not see much difference in the two. It is lighter ,but the features seem about the same. My first complaint is it locked up on me only once and I hard booted it back. I hope this is a fluke!! The second is on the light settings for the brightness with the new one I am on #19 and on my second one I have a # 17 setting. This seems a bit odd to me with a newer model. However, in all fairness with the Holidays and all that needs to be done it has not been used as much yet. Maybe if given this review in a month or so, I would rate it higher, because I love the Paperwhiies!!!"
On The West Coast,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to upgrade from the Fire 7 tablet to the Paperwhite since the Fire 7 tablet did not hold a charge for more than one day; otherwise the Fire 7 was a great portable reader. Amazon claimed the Paperwhite would hold a charge for WEEKS. After owning and using my Paperwhite for about a month (I read about an hour a day), the battery lasts about one week at best (I can live with this). However, the most annoying and discouraging part of this machine is that the touchscreen is not very response. I have to touch the screen multiple times to turn a page; however, sometimes the current page changes without even touching the screen (losing my place!). Also, trying to get the top menu to appear can take up to five touches/taps. I do not like wasting my reading time trying to get this machine to respond. Maybe the Paperwhite I received was defective, but I do not recommend it."
Cheezr,3.0 out of 5 stars,"<updated>
within 10 minutes of posting my review, I received a phone call from Amazon Customer Support and with a factory reset and reregistration of the kindle the wifi started working again, so that was good. Also I found where they had moved the show clock while reading option, also good. I was impressed with the fine customer support and so updated my review and rating. If the wifi wanders off again I will update my review.
<original>
first off I notice zero performance or other differences from the previous paperwhite with the exception of the features that amazon removed from the previous paper white just as they released this one with those features (inverted text I am looking at you).
My wifi connection just stopped working after having the new kindle for two weeks so if I had to guess I would say between this one and my last one which was completely reliable is that this one appears to be ""cost optimized"" and P.S. you will need to buy a new case..."
Brandy Allen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The last tablet I had was the kindle fire 7, so I decided to go to the kindle paperwhite for reading.

I love this, it's smaller so it's easier to hold. I love the feature on this where after a certain time it goes to sleep, or I can close the case and it sleeps.

I also love the battery life on this as well, it stays charged for days before I have to charge it again (and I read a lot too)

I also love that I can go into a dark area and read my book, then go out into the sun without having to adjust the screen brightness.

I also love that it's easy to read (the font is a good size and you can adjust the font)

Overall this is a great device to read on"
minimimof2,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have only has this only a few days now and I just adore how I can read no matter if the light is on or off ! For me it makes reading easier as I get older . The touch screen is touchy as all get out and I do wish that I was able to keep my Paperwhite on my book list . So far the only draw back on this one is that once you finish a book you have to go back to home screen then head to your library which get old fast . Now as too the battery life . I am a reader I rarely watch tv so this is what I do and the battery doesn't last all day at all not like the Touch Kindle did . But still it is a great reader so just be ready to learn that a few more steps are needed in order to get to your library .
ClassicPinkReviews,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m not entirely sure what I expected but the paperwhite is now a part of my life. Having never had a Kindle before I expected it to be bulky and large but it certainly isn’t. It fits my hand pretty well.

My only complaint is that sometimes it is overly sensitive to touch (while reading). At other times it is not sensitive to touch such as when I’m trying to access and keyboard to type. I also wish it integrated with my audible subscription just a little better- I’m forced to buy a Bluetooth to enjoy it.

I enjoy the long battery life and the fact that it charges up really quickly. That’s a huge plus. I also love that it’s waterproof. The dictionary and Wikipedia integration is wonderful. Definitely great for building a better vocabulary and general knowledge.

Finally I will add that I love how it offers the chance for more distraction free reading. With the kindle app on my phone I found myself easily distracted by alerts and notifications on my phone for everyday things. The paperwhite has helped me focus and finish books quicker than usual."
J. Ostermiller,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had 4 or 5 year old Kindle Paperwhite that I used daily, reading over 250 titles. During that time I began to notice a gradual sluggishness and slowdown of performance, typical with aging electronic devices. So when Amazon offered a 25% trade-in discount along with a $25 gift card for a new Kindle, with more memory, newer longer lasting battery, and waterproofing, I thought ""Why Not?"" Like other users, I checked out the reviews first, I and could not understand the snipping about battery life issues, system slowness issues, screen contrast problems, and a sensitive on-off button. Undeterred I returned my old Kindle by UPS, and within a couple of weeks the new Kindle arrived, along with a new Amazon fabric cover that I'd ordered.

I'm very pleased to report that this is by far the best Kindle Paperwhite yet. The new software took a couple of days to get used to, as the menus for accessing all the features and adjustments are different. There is plenty of battery life, in fact more than my old Kindle. I read several hours a day and have yet to go below 50% in a week's time. It's nothing to plug it in at night as I do my cell phone when needed. The on-off button at the base of the Kindle is not as sensitive as reported by some. The Kindle reacts immediately when the case is opened. It even tells you when it is waking up from a deep sleep state, and lets you know when to swipe to unlock the device. Amazon's lightly textured fabric case makes the Kindle a delight to hold and protects it from bumps and dirt. The display is clean and crisp, with adjustable contrast, and a good selection of fonts to choose from for easy reading in the size of your choice. Unlike some users, I don't keep hundreds (or thousands) of books on my Kindle. That's what Amazon's cloud storage is for! If it's that important I usually buy a hard copy book for my home library.

The day I got my Kindle I plugged it in to give the battery a full 24 hour charging cycle. Meanwhile I turned on the Kindle and was pleased to see that it was already registered to my Amazon account! While it was charging I went on line to make sure the Kindle was updated with the current software, which I downloaded and installed. The only small negative is that my old kindle was preloaded with Sudoku Works, yet the new version would not support the game, or any game for that matter. So if you are thinking of upgrading your older Kindle Paperwhite to the newer version, GO FOR IT, and expect to be pleasantly surprised!"
RG,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgrading from a Kindle touch, all of the highlights and notes from the documents that I have loaded to this Paperwhite from my Kindle Touch are gone. Extensive research shows that you CAN NOT TRANFER HIGHLIGHTS AND NOTES from an old Kindle to this device unless you bought the book from Amazon. I mark up many articles, personal documents, and papers; there's no reason Amazon should block these notes from transferring.

The ads are five times more annoying then on the Kindle touch. The device takes longer to come out of sleep mode, and requires you to swipe away an ad before allowing you to continue reading.

Other reviewers have also commented that the screen will freeze occasionally. All you can do is wait a couple minutes for it to start responding again.

Amazon removed a physical home button so now you are required to use additional effort to get to the home screen. This is doubly a problem when the screen stops responding to touch.

The battery does not last as long as my Kindle touch. I leave the device in airplane mode, but that doesn't help.

Why did they take away the speakers and the headphone jack? Because they were useful features. Not everyone owns Bluetooth headphones you know.

Amazon removed the ability to swipe up and down to advance to the next or previous chapter in a book. This was a very helpful feature that I utilized constantly. Swiping up and down now does nothing. They could easily program it to do something useful like switch between chapters!

Waterproof? Who cares, unless it's dishwasher safe. The higher screen resolution is the main reason I wanted this Kindle in addition to the light. The screen resolution is good.

The light is very blue. It is a terrible color for reading at night. When are you going to use the light? At night! Sometimes I think people never try testing the devices they design.

The experimental web browser is still just as bad as ever.

You can no longer access the dictionary by highlighting a word in a book. Yes, you can highlight a word and it's definition will appear, however you cannot click into the dictionary to explore other words. You have to find the dictionary on your device which is hidden far far away. It is not easy to use!

Essentially, the Kindle that had the most thought put into it was the Kindle touch. The Kindle that had the most thought taken out of it was this one."
RJSB,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Solid reader, ebook library, audible for listening - Kindle Ecosystem is the best in the business! I would prefer a color e-ink reader to make things a bit more interesting for kids in my son's age (10). He likes to read comics and b&w seems to be a gen old for these kids!

As for as Kindle concerned, this is the BEST it can get! Solidly built, satisfyingly sturdy in your hand but light weight, fits in my pant or shorts packets! Must BUY for everyone who does not have a habit of reading or anyone who is an avid reader.

Cons: Less titles in Audible, and in certain subjects (not applicable to many, it is specific to me, but there is an alternate. I can get PDFs and store it!)

Final tip: You don't need to transfer PDFs to the kindle using cable! You can send an email to the kindle and it is in your library! Someone who is very smart is there in the Kindle team! Kudos. Two thumbs up."
Robloo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value in this model. I read A LOT so throw out any quoted battery stats: reading 2-5 hours a day (frequently more) with 80% light gives me 4-6 days of battery before I notice and recharge (and recharging is quick). Touch screen is probably better than I rate it - I have the same issue on other touch screens so it's probably me... You've got +27GB to use from the start (32GB is ALWAYS size of storage before deducting operating system, etc.) - I've added slightly more than 600 eBooks and I've still used less than 1.75GB. For the pure and simple pleasure of reading books, you can't beat this. I also have my Libby account (with library card) set up to use. Even with a light case it weighs very little. Quite comfortable to hold and reading is a joy."
Alicia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Battery life of this updated model far exceeds that of another Paperwhite that I use. The cover I purchased is attractive and fits like a second skin (don't think I'll ever be able to remove it). This model (with cover) weighs 10.5 ounces, as compared to the 8.2 of my other Paperwhite. The only feature missing (or I just haven't located it) is that it doesn't indicate the percentage of battery life remaining when ""settings"" is selected, as did previous models. Bottom line: the Amazon Kindle will continue to be my go-to reading device."
J. Wei,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Things I liked:
1. The light-weight, thin, compact design of the Kindle is perfect for me to carry in my bag when I'm on the go
2. It is easy to use and get my book up and running

Things I disliked:
1. The only way to get White Text on Black Background is to use the accessibility ""Inverted"" feature. The text brightness can only go up so much, and with my eyes being used to looking at crisp screens - like the iPhone for example, looking at the Kindle for long periods of time strain my eyes.
2. When using the inverted setting (white text on black background), whenever I tapped a word to know its meaning, the the outline of that pop up ""bleed"" into the black background. It is so annoying. Every time I click a word, I have to close my Kindle to have the black background ""reset"".
3. The processing speed is just not up to scratch. I understand it is not as fast of a processor as the iPad for example, but it's something difficult to get used to once one has gotten used to Apple products.

Overall, this item got some positives. I initially bought it because I wanted something simple, lightweight, with long battery life to satisfy my reading needs only. However, the crispiness of the screen is just not there... and in the hindsight, I should have just paid a bit more to purchase the iPad mini instead."
Bardessa,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Just bought a new 10th generation Kindle; the old 3rd gen died. This one is a very convenient size: just 6.5"" x 4.5"" and so Lightweight! Couldn't find a lightweight protective case that I liked so I'm just using a cloth 7"" x 5"" bag I use for keeping keys and a wallet while walking around the neighborhood. I like the way the Kindle Paperwhite loaded as soon as I entered my email and password; still trying to get used to the features. I don't like the opening ads that have to be gotten through before reading. I miss seeing the authors at the beginning but the authors were a problem since they were not diverse. I prefer diverse authors instead of the FT ad. I finally bought a felt cover MOKO. Faux leather protective cases are available but expensive! And one reviewer says the magnetic clasp drains the battery! I downgraded review by one star because getting to my new downloaded books is not easy. Had to keep trying different icons til I saw the new books."
Tina D,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The charger doesn't fit properly and I have to wiggle it ...just right...to get it to start to charge and forget about touching it while it's charging.
The screen flashes often and turning pages seems to refresh the entire book.
I am unable to move the books around within the collections. So they go in whatever order they like. In a book collection I have 13 books and I don't always know which book is next in the series or which books I may want to skip.
Overall I am not happy with the total product.
I will say this though, it's small and compact and fits in my purse. - changed to 3 stars since I do use it"
MB,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me first say that I love Kindle. I can never go back to reading paper books; and I am a very active reader.
The two stars is representative of my view of this new version as there are some clear fumbles:
1. This version seems MUCH slower to start up from sleep mode than past versions. Yes, its less than 2 seconds but I should'nt have to wait much at all.
2. The light seems to have changed. At the lowest setting - its still too bright. Many Kindle users read in bed. We want the lowest light. If I had to guess - I'd say its more than 10% brighter on this lowest setting than on past versions.
3. You removed the 'max' button on the light setting. Minor quibble but a regression in my mind.
4. I get that its waterproof but I feel that has affected button and screen sensitivity.
Overall, I just view it as a step back."
Bern44,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Button at bottom - annoying. Once it's turned on , you can't go to the book, you 're bombarded with ads for purchases. It feels like an advertising bulletin and not a kindle. And the books are so pricy. I was able to read the NYT on my old Kindle, I now have to pay another subscription of more than $16.00 to read the NYT on my new Kindle. My old kindle which fell on the floor and cracked was larger but soooooo pleasant to use. I do not yet have a cover, because that, again, is a small fortune. I missed the cut off to return, so now I'm stuck with a kindle I absolutely hate.
Do NOT buy this kindle. I just switched to buying books on Apple, and so much more affordable while being able to read on my iPhone, or ipad. Done with you Kindle!!!"
DB,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned kindle e-readers since they first came out. I've always bought paperwhites because I prefer the experience. I've been completely disappointed with this new offering. I bought this version because my old paperwhite was starting to not sync with my phone and since I switch back and forth throughout the day it was becoming a problem. First (and most important) issue is the battery life. My old paperwhite was 6 years old and still held a charge for 2 to 2 1/2 weeks. This new one? 3 days. Tops. I even called tech support to see if there was an issue. They reset everything, still no change. And my reading habits have NOT changed. Second issue is the design. Its been stated in other reviews and I have to agree, the designer who decided to put the on/off button on the bottom and have the light come on to full wattage when the reader powers up needs to return to design school. Bad choices both of them. Bottom line, if you have an old kindle that is still working, keep it until (hopefully) Amazon decides to rework this new one. It is not worth the money."
T,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ll start off by saying this is my first e-reader and I’ve been using it for almost four weeks now. I got the Kindle Paperwhite 8GB in black with special offers. Overall, it’s great and I’m happy to have it.

Setup/getting books onto the device took some time. I didn’t realize I wouldn’t be able to access books directly on the Paperwhite through apps. I understand the reason for this—it’s an e-reader to read books. Also, it was difficult to find information and how-tos specific to the Paperwhite. Luckily I could download books via my iPad by linking my OverDrive and Amazon accounts. Once I figured this out, it was simple enough; if it was more of a process, I probably would have returned it. Now if only Cloud Library were compatible as most of the books on my reading list are available there...

The page/screen is so crisp and clear. However the glare, usually from harsh artificial lighting, can get in the way. I have to move the Kindle around as I’m reading down the page to avoid the glare. The screen also holds smudges that don’t wipe off easily.

I wish the on/off button were at the top or side. With it on the bottom, I can’t really prop it up against something because it’ll sit on the power button. Surprisingly it hasn’t been accidentally turned it too many times but I‘m very aware and careful about how I hold or prop it up because I know the power button is there.

The touchscreen is a bit finicky. Response time is a little slow where it takes a second to load the screen; on some functions it kind of “flashes” as the screen turns black before loading. Sometimes it doesn’t register the tap to turn a page, or it turns to the next page though I tapped to the left of the screen to go back a page. None of this is too unbearable though.

The “ads” look more like a screensaver. They’re images that look pretty cool on this type of screen and I don’t mind them.

I was surprised at how small it was, which ends up being better for me. It’s also so light which makes it easier to carry around and hold. The font can be enlarged so the small screen doesn’t take away from its readability.

Battery life seems good. Again, been using it for almost four weeks and I just charged it for the second time. I wouldn’t say I read a lot though. I thought there would be nothing in terms of charging so I was happy to discover it in fact came with a cord; I have plug adapters from many other electronics."
Rick,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As an owner of an original Kindle and a Kindle Fire, I was hoping that the paper white would replace the original Kindle entirely, and replace the Kindle Fire for reading purposes. I was disappointed.

While the paper white does allow for reading in the dark, it does not have the same contrast as the original Kindle or the fire. It does not have a contrast adjustment. It appears to me that the text is more of a gray rather than black like the original. I actually prefer the older Kindle for reading in daylight. The fire has always been good for reading in normal light or in the dark.

The paper white clearly has some nice new features, but in my case, the touch screen keyboard was defective (the bottom row of keys were unreliable), and the blue tooth interface would not pair with my speaker. The paper white is slightly lighter, smaller, and water resistant. The are nice improvements. It does not come with a charger.

Having returned the Paperwhite, I will continue to use my Kindle Fire table as my primary device (It is much more than a reader.) and will use the original Kindle for reading in bright light."
Jeremy C. Dehn,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite is a great product--had an older Kindle and loved it, and just tried to upgrade, and at first look it is indeed the best Kindle yet... But I just can't deal with it anymore. I paid an extra $20 to not have ads, but the home screen still has far more real estate dedicated to books Amazon wants me to buy than it does to the books in my library--books that I just want to sit down and read instead of being sold on something else for the zillionth time. Is it really not enough that I already see dozens of your ads every day everywhere I look, online and otherwise? Part of me feels like I'm overreacting, but I guess this is a straw-breaking-the-camel's back moment for me. I'm returning the Kindle and getting a competitor's e-reader. So long, 160-book Amazon library. Just not worth this anymore. Just done."
Elaine M. Chandler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older Kindle Fire, but I found that I was using the Kindle App on my iPhone or my iPad, rather than carry the Fire around with me. But now that I am retired and living nearby the beach in Florida, I bought the new Kindle Paperwhite specifically to take to the beach. It is so lightweight, is just the right size, and best of all, waterproof. When I am not using it at the beach, I do keep it in a waterproof hip pack, along with my phone to keep the sand off it, but knowing that it's waterproof gives me extra assurance. The beach isn't the only place I take it, though. I take it to the coffee shop, airport, or my favorite recliner. I feel that the negative reviews are being too picky. It really is perfect!"
Beezer81,3.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, so first let me start by saying I've never owned an e-reader, so this is very new to me. I got the Paperwhite a couple weeks ago and I am definitely conflicted with how I feel about it. On one hand, I really love how portable it is, and it's easy to use, can obviously get a TON of books on it, and so on. However, my issue is that it really is TINY. Like, I know it's not the size of a normal paperback book and it's not supposed to be, but it's still a bit on the small side. I'm contemplating swapping it out for the Oasis, but it's SOOO expensive and I honestly don't know if I want to spend that kind of money on an e-reader when I can certainly get by fine with the Paperwhite.

Plus, another key factor in my decision to just keep the Paperwhite is because Amazon does not allow you to use your Amazon gift card balance to purchase items on monthly payments. I am very upset about this, as I was hoping to pay some of the balance on the Oasis with my gift card money then buy accessories, and I can use my card on file to pay the remaining monthly payments. Well, they don't let you do that, which is a terrible feature if you ask me. It's literally the reason I am not able to really afford to get the Oasis because it's just way too expensive to buy upfront (at least for me!). I really wish I had not asked for so many Amazon gift cards for Christmas - such a waste when I can't even use them to get what I want. Probably will return the Paperwhite since I doubt I'm going to get much use out of it with the screen being too small for me. It's really a shame, it's actually a beautiful e-reader and does what I need it to do, but I can't get through more than a cuple pages of a book without it driving me nuts at the smaller screen size. I know the Oasis is just an inch bigger, but it looks a LOT more like a book. If the newer 2019 Oasis would go on sale, I could maybe look into getting it, but it hasn't yet as far as I know. Maybe I will look into other e-readers - anyone know of ones that are better than the kindles? Any advice would be great, thanks!"
N. Wortham,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first e-reader so some of the things that I think could be better might just be an e-reader thing.
Pros:
-Very lightweight and easy to carry around
-Easy on the eyes
-Nice light for reading in the dark

Cons
- Connecting bluetooth devices have been iffy (ex. UConnect in the car will not connect. I have had to restart the device at times to connect a different pair of headphones)
- Slow response to button presses. I am used to tablets/phones but I did not expect such a lag when selecting settings or swiping to unlock for instance

Overall, I do enjoy the Kindle. I have had it one my person since I bought it. The only time I get sad is when it wont connect to my cars bluetooth."
Jeanne Finley,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My old kindle had a much larger page. All of the items I had on it did not transfer to the new one. I'd rather have the contents listed in words, instead of the icons which are too small and have very poor graphics. I thought I could use Audible without bluetooth."
Elizabeth D. Martin,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First the positive: nice small size, very lightweight, nice feel in the hand. My very old Kindle would no longer charge, so I decided to get a Paperwhite since I mostly read on my Kindle and can play Words With Friends on my phone. I thought I had read all the specs, but totally did not understand that there is absolutely no COLOR on the Paperwhite. There are only shades of gray. Highlighlighting is gray, books in the store are in grayscale, recipes have gray food pictures. I am very disappointed. I like color in my life. Also, it used to be easy to bookmark a page; now it is a multistep process and other features I am accustomed to, seem to be gone. Because I do like the size and weight of the device, and there is no alternative with color, I will keep it. I am going on record, though, as being extremely disappointed, and would like to suggest a Paperwhite with a color option for the future. Thank you."
LavenderLady 62,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like that this reader is lighter and faster. I had the Voyager and the page turner was not as fast as this Paperwhite is. Also I like the size and weight of this one. I can sit in my bed at night and hold my kindle without my arm getting tired. With me having arthritis this kindle is very easy and light to handle. Thanks to Amazon.
Li Zhang,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Traded my older generation Kindle to get this one. Love it! Truly water resistant. Been reading in the tub and next to the sink where I get ready in the morning. I don't have to stop reading any more~

Only flaw: in my old Kindle, when you wake the screen in the dark, the screen will light up with the same light setting you have for reading (since I read in the dark before bed or when I cannot go back to sleep, I have it at a 2, very low light setting). However, in this new model, when you wake the screen, the screen lights up so brightly that would usually startle me, after a few seconds, it would go to the light setting I have for reading... So I have been holding the Kindle away from my eyes to wake it up, and when I forget to do that, I will be too awake to fall back to sleep for a good while."
Bohemian reader,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is hard to get used to not turning pages. I wish there were page numbers on each page. I know the format has to be different than the book because the kindle can't hold a whole book page, but it could read p. 1, p.1 1/3, p.1 1/2, etc.
I like the light, I don't have to worry about being near a lamp. The print is large enough and clear and easy to read. I guess it is just hard for me to get used to.
I have finished one book since I got it, 3 days ago and am starting on another already. It is kind of addicting. Plus I like that you can get free books and books from the library. Once I get used to the kindle I may read less regular books. My book shelves are already overflowing."
nursedee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for myself to Christmas so that I could see what the buzz is about using a tablet type reader vs an actual book. I do like this product, it is taking me some getting use to since I love the feel of a book in my hand.

However, I wanted to be able to take this with me on trips, etc and not have to tote around my books and/or be able to download a book instead of having to go to the store to buy it.

I like that you can change the words to the black background with white font.
You can change the size of the font, the font itself, etc.
I love the back light on this Kindle.
I love that it has audible, I use audible when driving etc but it's nice to listen to a book on the Paper white while reading along too.
This paper white is thin and light weight. Easy to carry around in your purse, bag, etc and not add weight to it or take up a lot of room.
I am happy with my purchase and do see myself continuing to use this reader."
Westernwarrior,3.0 out of 5 stars,"When people say ""it's only good for reading books; it's not a tablet,"" make sure you fully understand what that means. Of course you can't play games or watch videos or take pictures with a Paperwhite, but there are a lot of other things to be aware of:

The processor in this is just barely enough to let you flip through pages in your ebooks. Navigating the user interface is sluggish. Typing has to be done VERY slowly or else you get ahead of the device and it misses letters. Etc.

""Experimental browser"" is a kind way to say ""this browser acts like a Pentium 133 trying to run IE 10 would."" It gets hijacked by malware on websites that a real browser like chrome or firefox would not be affected by. It doesn't scroll up or down, or side to side, except painfully slowly. Pinching to zoom in/out is frustrating and doesn't do much to make websites more readable. Etc.

The e-ink display may be better for your eyes than an LCD screen, but a trait of the e-ink display is a very jarring black-and-white screen flash any time a significant amount of the screen needs to refresh, like almost any time you navigate any menu. It also happens every few page turns in ebooks, which in my opinion greatly detracts from the relaxing aspect of reading a book and the perk this display has of being ""easy"" on your eyes.

Unless you only ever plan to read books off of prime or kindle store or goodreads recommended lists, such that you can click on one of these options and immediately see a book you want to buy, this device requires a lot of work on your part to utilize. For example: it's very difficult to find free books on the kindle itself. You'll need to use an actual computer to look around and find books to then get put onto your kindle. You can get websites and documents (pdfs and docs and such) into ebook format to read on your paperwhite... but only by using browser extensions on a PC or downloading third-party programs that can convert documents to the format needed for your kindle. And even then, many documents converted in this way will lack the convenient navigation options a true ebook has for moving around between chapters and such.

All that said, when you come to terms with: paying $120 for an ereader that isn't full of ads, paying another $50 for an adapter and cover, the fact that you'll have to put a fair amount of effort into assembling a decent library to read on your kindle, and the sluggish and awkward performance of the processor and e-ink display... it's an acceptable ereader with a few neat features. I would really have preferred if they spent development time and effort on better performance, a smoother refresh on the display, and more functionality for finding books and converting to ebook formats on the device itself rather include gimmicky features like Word Wise (which just does a poor job of identifying words that a reader likely needs help with, and even on the ""fewest hints"" setting keeps defining commonplace words, and which messes with the spacing on the page) and letting me know how many other users have highlighted a given passage in a book and other similar things."
Bable4QT,3.0 out of 5 stars,"4 fails with 10th Generation Device

1st) Battery life with ebooks only = Great + Lasts Long

2nd) Battery life with audibles (with or without ebook combined use) = its okay if you are available to recharge within 24 hour (roughly)

3rd) Bluetooth sync = Fail. I have to remove all prior Bluetooth devices and turn off the Bluetooth on the Kindle just to get it to connect again to an existing Bluetooth speaker. It should be able to remember the devices for easy connections (aka it's failing here 100%).

4th) Switch between eBook / Audible = Fail. You can use it for one of these methods at a time. It does not allow you to listen to the Audible and read the ebook at the same time (which the phone kindle apps does allow).

Note: I had the Kindle 7th generation before, so the paperwhite back light, larger memory, and audible are upgrades ... BUT the Kindle phone application still greatly wins over the actual kindle devices. The Kindle Fire tablets is not an option (eye strain from reflective glares, cost to much, poor battery life, limited OS uses, too bulky, etc.). Until 4 things mentioned earlier is improved then think most folks should stick with using the phone applications."
DBH,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this Kindle to replace the one that I've had for several years that died mid-update. After spending several days trying to restart ordered this new one. Seems to work like the old one. One thing that bothered me, is that Amazon had to change the size of the new one just enough that I had to buy a new cover for the new unit. I don't see any new features that justified changing the size other than they want you to buy a new cover along with the new Kindle. The new Kindle has a much larger memory and will hold more books. Took forever for my library to download and get it set up like the old one, buy now it's working great. Haven't had it long enough to comment on the battery life, but it seems to be holding OK so far."
Jasmine Redington,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently bought my Kindle Paperwhite because I had a very old Kindle Fire that wasn't working too well anymore (it was several years old). There's honestly so much to love about the Paperwhite. It isn't too expensive and you really get so much with it. It's waterproof, truly doesn't glare which makes reading in the sun effortless, has a battery that lasts weeks, and it's lightweight. It also allows you to set up a Good Reads account so they can help you discover more books you might like and has an area on the home screen that recommends books you might like based on your reading history. I also have a list on Amazon I titled ""Books to Read"" and it will show me the books in that list and it will show you the next book in a series you're reading. I learned recently that when you buy a book on your Paperwhite it will automatically deliver the book to all your devices instead of making you manually do it on each device. Honestly, the Paperwhite is every book lover's dream!"
Patricia G. Hurtt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love my Kindle paperwhite! This Kindle is lightweight and easy to hold. The ability to change the settings of the screen and the font sizes makes reading even easier. The pages turn with a touch of the screen quickly and easily. I have not charged it since I got it for Christmas and I use it every single day! Easy on/off, compact enough to fit in my purse or pocket, lighter than my phone and with a larger screen. Keep track of books you’ve downloaded and read or need to read, create lists of books you want to read in the Goodreads feature, purchase books right from the kindle store or borrow via Kindle owners lending library. I haven’t even touched on al of the features yet! It’s awesome."
Luis Zib,2.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely not what I expected this was a more of buying in pyramid scheme type just because I understand it cost money to read books but purchasing the initial product almost seems as you were signing up for a membership to read unlimited books it’s not quite like that it’s almost as if you’re buying a DVD player to Soli rent out movies specifically from Amazon and nowhere else Definitely not what I expected this was a more of buying in pyramid scheme type just because I understand it cost money to read books but purchasing the initial product almost seems as you were signing up for a membership to read unlimited books it’s not quite like that it’s almost as if you’re buying a DVD player to Soli rent out movies specifically from Amazon and nowhere else Just because you have the initial investment of find a kindle still does not give you access to the library then once you get to the library that you are paying the subscription on you also have to purchase the books so it’s kind of a rip off
Christopher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been on the fence with buying a e-reader for a while, trying to justify the price. Long story short, it's totally worth it, especially if you're an avid reader.

Most of my reading these days is torn between PDF's on my MacBook Pro and traditional paper and ink. This device is the ultimate solution to the cumbersome reading on laptops and saving money on buying traditional books. The experience is as satisfying to me as holding an actual book. Super simplified, nothing special to it. Owning a kindle sent me on a couple days of excitement of getting all the books I've wanted and taking files and converting them through the program Calibre–a must have program to compliment your kindle (windows and macOS).

If you're on the fence, go for it. It will save you money in the long run and the convenience of having hundreds of books in your pocket–from diagnostic manuals to novels–is something magical"
Alexandra French,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a nook for the longest time and it finally pooped out on me. Oh my goodness, this Kindle Paperwhite is everything I wanted in my old e-reader and more. I already have a pretty good kindle library going, and I was reading everything on my phone's kindle app. But as we all know, it's real easy to get distracted by notifications and stuff. The Paperwhite is perfect size, I love that screen brightness can be adjusted for reading in darker lighting. I'm a big fan of staying up late with a good book and the fact that I don't need a lamp on is huge for me. I also can't wait to try it out in the bathtub since it's supposed to be waterproof. I love reading, whether a real book or an e-reader, and I love this paperwhite!"
CopperCarla,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Received this delivery last night (08Apr 2019). Set it up and plugged it in overnight as it was at 50% charge. This morning, it’s completely unusable. The screen is faded, can’t read anything. There’s content there, it’s just so washed out it’s illegible. You can make out a word or letter here and there, I had to guess to try and reset it. Still no luck.

UPDATE: Moving this to a neutral 3* because the return process was so easy, and the money was credited almost immediately upon taking it to a UPS store (within an hour). Still disappointed that it didn’t work, and not sure I want to re-order at this time, but feel better that I don’t have to wait 10 days or more for a refund."
P. Porter,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this paperwhite e-reader for myself specifically for the audible function. After an hour on the phone with a very nice Amazon representative and another hour scouring Amazon forums, I have come to the conclusion that this purchase was a huge waste of money for me. The various solutions included powering off the kindle each and every time I wanted to connect my Bluetooth headphones, re-pairing the headphones each time I wanted to listen to audible. To make matters worse, these solutions worked only a couple of times, then I could not connect at all. Overall, if you just want to use this item as an e-reader, its fine. If you want a working audible function use another device."
Westie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would have given this zero stars when I first got it. I had a real old kindle that I had had since 2010. This new one really took some getting used to. The arrangement of the books is still something I don’t like. For one thing my collections did not come over in the cloud. They are device specific. My whole library came over and I have had to try and sort them out. Archived were included also. Another thing I don’t like is that when you put a book in a collection it still leaves it in the open library. On my old one, they would go into collection and would not show anywhere else. It has gotten a little easier to use as the days have gone by and know it’s just something I have got to get used to."
Chocolate lady,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The only reason I wanted a new Kindle paperwhite was that I wanted a back lit screen. Well.... I got that and much more. First let me say that it is a gift from my son and daughter-in -law. If I had purchased it myself I would most certainly return it. It is too complicated. The touch screen is very slow to respond if at all. It doesn't hold a charge. Everything is done on screen including turning pages. First you have to find the menu bar which is hidden until you tap on the top of the screen. Then you wait and wait.... After a few hours on the phone with a very helpful person from Kindle I'm no better off. All the options are hidden. You have to select symbols and hope they open after you tap the screen. Even after you tap on what you think you want, something else comes on the screen. Unless you are very good with electronic devices, if your current paperwhite is not broken don't bother."
Stuart L.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My 2014 6th generation Kindle Paperwhite stopped holding a charge so I upgraded. This new one is really smooth. The old one displayed a very noticeable flicker when turning pages, but this one is really instantaneous. If you blink when turning a page you won't be aware that the page actually turned. However, my old Kindle would go for nearly 2 months without needing a battery charge, but this one barely lasts 2 weeks. Big disappointment."
deedee62,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this kindle! Have owned several since they first sold and I have used them until they basically die as I read every day for at least one hour. This paired with the free kindle unlimited offer for three month has made me very happy. I read on the bus on the way to work every weekday and even if the lights on bus are dim (unintentional; some of the buses I ride are old and ready to break down), I can still see perfectly with the light on the screen. *it did take some getting used to as it is kind of sensitive and turns the pages quickly when you tap the side even accidentally when you are perhaps just trying to underline a word or comment. I’m getting better at it though. Compact and light enough to fit in my small handbag."
Cynthia Williams,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First some background: My first e-reader was a Kindle keyboard bought because I wanted one and my sister had one. I used it primarily while waiting in doctors' offices. It was lighter and easier than carrying a tote bag of paperbacks. When I started having problems with my vision I started using the e-reader a LOT. It died. I researched all Amazon offered at the time and purchased a Kindle Voyage. I liked the size and weight, the page turn buttons, lights and print. I read two or more books per day. My Voyage lasted a little over a year and a half. It froze up and died. When I went to get another, my choices were the Paperwhite or the Oasis. The Paperwhite was less expensive, similar in size and weight to the Voyage. It has most of the features of the Voyage, at least the ones I used. The software allows me to set and save my font type and size which is wonderful. I don't think the contrast between the background and the print is quite as good, but it's acceptable. The battery life is ok for the amount I use the device. It charges very fast and I can read while it is charging. Overall, not the Voyage, but a very acceptable replacement. I would recommend it to everyone who would like an e-reader."
Michael,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had several kindles from the original, to keyboard, to the paperwhite, and now the newest paperwhite.
Love It and even though I picked up the one without 3g support, wifi is doing great. I typically send myself books all the time and they come through and look great.
The only problem I have had is every 3 days or so, randomly, the battery will completely die. Even when not in use. So could be an issue for others. First time QC has let me down."
Muhammed Shonibare,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve been a big fan of this product. Honestly this is my 8th one. I’ve deployed 4 times and going on my 5th for my country I’ve destroyed more of these then is practical and I’m looking forward to all of the bells and whistles of this new product. But I already see a problem. The charging cord don’t want to go in it’s hard to push in and don’t stay In.
H Coop,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish I had gone for the 32 instead of 8 for storage. Mines full and not even half of my books are in it. And most are not downloaded.
I had a really difficult time with this ereader for months. I could not get books from the cloud! Finally I got a good customer service person that actually helped me.
It is pleasant to read off of & lightweight but it is extremely slow and not very user friendly.

**UPDATE** it’s now January 2020 and I’m having even more issues! I would NOT purchase again which is sad because it really is pleasant to read off of. But it locks up frequently, restarts on its own (WHILE IM TRYING TO READ) several times a week. It’s soooo slow and NOT user friendly. And I still only have access to half my library"
R. Hines,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have truly been WOWED by my Kindle White!!! I have used it several times a day since purchasing it last month. After spending a short while learning about the features of the product, it was up and running! It is easy to use and easily fits in my purse! I use it when I’m waiting in line, reading in bed, or just in the mood to read. It has a very convenient bookmark that I use to save my place and I can easily get right back to my story! I also love being able to choose between reading materials (magazines, short stories, novels) just at the touch of a finger! This was a fabulous purchase!"
Victoria,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My first e-reader was a Nook Color, which I still have and use occasionally. Until recently, I've used an Android tablet as my e-reader, but I have been finding the tablet uncomfortably heavy and reading on the tablet started to cause some eyestrain. I decided to try the lightweight Kindle as an alternative, and it certainly is superior to the tablet in terms of weight and reading comfort and battery life. I still often use my tablet, however, not only because I have a big library of EPUB files, but also because the smaller size of the Kindle screen takes some getting used to. I have found the Kindle much more comfortable after I added a popsocket to the back, which makes holding it quite comfortable and avoids the issue with accidentally hitting the off button when holding it by the frame. I did not get the ad free version and I don't even notice ads."
Stephanie Brown,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband broke my kindle fire on accident so he surprised me with the kindle paperwhite. Quite honestly, if given the option I would take my kindle fire back in a heartbeat.

Cons:
1. I cannot stand the fact that everything is black and white, including book covers. I can’t even tell what half of the artwork is of, which is a huge bummer. Not sure my husband knew that ahead of ordering it, but had I known, I wouldn’t have ordered it at all.
2. “Highlighting” text is actually really difficult. It’s either not sensitive enough and won’t even highlight a sentence or it’s way too sensitive and highlights everything on a single page and beyond...there is no in between. I just finished reading a self-help book and had such a hard time making notes of parts of the book I want to go back to because the highlighting option was such a pain in the behind.
3. Scrolling down to read book reviews in the App Store takes FOREVER!! You can either scroll at the speed of molasses or you can tap on the side bar and hope you don’t skip over the review you wanted to read and ten other reviews in between. Very poor setup.

Pros:
1. Great battery life
2. Nice for reading in the dark, dims and brightens to good levels
3. Extremely lightweight

Would I recommend? Probably not."
Chuck,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The reading experience on my iPad Kindle app is far superior to the actual Kindle Paperwhite. It is slow, difficult to navigate. I do not believe that the battery will actually last for ""weeks"" as advertised since I saw it diminish from the 54% when I first turned it on down to 43% in only several hours of use. The one positive thing is that it is light weight and very easy to hold, but I'm sticking with my iPad Kindle and my Nexus 7 (Android) Kindle apps. I just like them better. The $40 discount motivated me to order a PaperWhite, but that's just not enough to keep me from sending it back."
Ric D.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought a paper white for my son- gift. Page refresh would not shut off. You get a black flash when changing pages.
I tried it, my son tried it, and my wife tried it. The black page refresh is the whether turned off or not. It drove all of us crazy! Talked to support - could not correct. Amazon sent me a replacement in one day, great service as always.
The replacement has the same issue - PAGE REFRESH OFF WORKS FOR A FEW PAGES AND THEN REVERTS TO THE VERY ANNOYING BLACK FLASH OF ""REFRESH ON""! We've had kindles for years, I have an Oasis, my wife has an older Paper White - no problems! We both love them."
John D. Leggett,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Too much black space around the edge of the screen. Scrolling backward is hit or miss. Smudges quiet easily but does seem to fatigue my eyes less than reading on my Samsung Galaxy S9 for extended periods. Higher resolution is not particular useful. Can't really tell on text. If I had it to do over, I would buy the cheaper one. Biggest single negative is the placement of the power button. It is on the bottom and the screen does not rotate. If you stand it up or lean it against something to read while, it turns off the display. So, you have to get something with give on it to rest it on, like a washcloth, folded up paper towel, etc. Super annoying and just a really dumb design decision. Put the button on the top!"
Toby&MaggiesMommy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a relatively expensive kindle which I did get a good price on. However I expect to get more than 13 months out of my electronics. I rarely even used it and best I can tell the battery is out or the charging port has gone out. I've had problems with it powering on before and it didn't want to wake up sometimes as well. I do wish this had happened a month ago, I bought my Granddaughter a kindle for Christmas and certainly wouldn't have done so. My old Galaxy tab that I used for reading as well is 5 years old and still going strong, don't waste your money on the kindles, nice convenient size and such but if you're only getting a year of very light use....kinda a waste of money."
J. Wells,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought to upgrade my old paperwhite that was starting to have issues connecting to WiFi and downloading books. Must admit didn’t really see a big difference in read type even though the 300 ppi is supposed to be better than the 167(?) ppi. But not being a techie may mean I’m just not as aware of the upgraded software. Anyway it works fine, seems a little slow to wake, backlight is good. Charge that is supposed to last for weeks was down to half in a few days and the new set up of the books is awful. With all the sales pitches for amazon books I can’t find mine that are downloaded. I have to pick through the ads to get to them. How sad that for all my purchases from amazon I’m not allowed to read in peace lest they miss an opportunity to sell me more. Only a week old so will see how well it really works."
S.M.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle. This Kindle eats battery energy like mad even when wifi and bluetooth are off. There is something wrong with the operating system so that I had to download 600 books onto this Kindle manually, one book at a time. I reached out to customer service and we rebooted and downloaded the latest version of the o.s. but nothing they suggested helped. I finally just gave up. Sometimes the screen freaks out and randomly changes fonts without me even touching it. You just watch the fonts change bigger and smaller and the lighting on the page changes until you force quit the machine and restart it. What a disappointment. But at least it is waterproof. At this point overall I would not recommend this version of Kindle."
Delta 13,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I went from a 2014 Voyage to a 2019 Paperwhite. I’m glad I got it during the Prime sale and didn’t pay full price. It feels like I was given my parents’ 1981 Toyota Corolla. It has 4 wheels, takes you places, radio even works - but it’s not exactly what you want in 2019.

Likes:
* Screen & brightness are fine.
* Storage is huge at 32GB.

Dislikes:
* To connect or reconnect any BT headset I have to cycle BT on the Kindle off & on again.
* No sleep mode on the Audible side.
* Also, the Audible side app seems ... primitive.
* To turn off WiFi you apparently have to use Airplane mode. Odd.

Meh:
* Bootup time. Saves battery I guess."
Emiliano,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I just upgraded to this Kindle PW4. Before it arrived to my hands I was thinking on selling my PW3 as soon as the new one arrived.
The ""paper like"" feel of the screen is GONE.
I REALLY MISS it.
I am having second thoughts about selling the PW3... I believe I will be selling the PW4 instead... but nobody will buy it from me at used at launch price 🤪
I bought it because of the IPX8 and double memory. I will not use Audible.
Conclusion: don't throw your money if you enjoy the paper like rough'iness!
PS: I also believe the contrast/ 'resolution' is better on the old one because the 'ink' is just in the 'paper'. In the new one it feels like there's an emptiness between the 'ink' and the 'plastic' glass."
kramwhite,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Forgetting that after I pre-ordered this they put it on sale to everyone else I love this reader. This is my 8th kindle (upgrades and gifts for others) It has better battery life that my old paperwhite. It does take longer to ""wake up"" but its only a few seconds and I am using it to remind myself to be patient. Adjusting the brightness is not as easy at it should be however I rarely need to change it. When it goes to sleep do to inactivity (getting coffee or bathroom break) it does not stop going to sleep when you get back to it. You see it dim for a moment then off. If you touch it when it dims it should stop going to sleep."
Karen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been buying Kindles over the years. The only time that I have to read fiction is when I am running on a treadmill. I just make the font large and it works. The one problem that I often had was that the slightest drop of perspiration would mess up my screen response. I run hard and long and sweaty. So I was excited about the idea of a waterproof one. Yes, it actually didn't stop responding when a drop of sweat fell onto the screen. But here's the amazing part: as usual, doing too many things at once, I had the new Kindle Paperwhite in my hands as well as a load of laundry to be washed. Guess what ended up going through the washing machine? My new Kindle! For a moment, I was devastated. Then, I was amazed as I was able to power the device up. It works perfectly. Really, really waterproof. Washing machine proof!"
Paddler,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product a lot. I use it every day, sometimes for hours per day. The battery life is high adequate in airplane mode. If left in communication with a WiFi unit, the battery will sometimes discharge in a day. I use airplane mode unless I want to download something from Amazon.
The touch screen is sometimes cranky and does not respond right away. The buttons on screen are too small, making it too easy to fat-finger an entry or selection. It took me 20 minutes to enter my sesquipedalian router password. I got it done by using a corner of a pinky and a lot of salty language.
The User Guides are not as well written as they should be. Sometimes I have to stumble on a useful function just by fat-fingering a button somewhere."
Melody McKinney,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my new Kindle Paperwhite for a month now. Overall I love it. Really like that the screen is smooth from side to side without the edge where dust and dirt got in with the older Paperwhites. The reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is because battery life doesn't seem as long as the older one I have. Paperwhite is always on Airplane mode except when I download, once I'm done downloading, it goes right back to airplane mode. I normally read for about an hour in the morning before I go to work, turn off Kindle. Then at night i probably read 2 to 4 hours after which i turn off Kindle. I've noticed that i have to charge once a week whereas with my old Kindle Paperwhite i only had to charge every 2 weeks. Other than that one thing, great updates and like it a lot."
Nc Gal,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this new Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas because I listen to Audible, but like to pick up and read the book where I left off when I get out of the car from a long trip. This new Kindle was going to be the perfect device for doing this. It isn't! I must first buy the Kindle and then if it has Whisper sync I can listen to the books. In order to use Audible, I must also buy the book. So in other words, I have to purchase 2 versions. This is CRAZY! That is not seamlessly. I like the Kindle, but the advertising for this model is very misleading. I have cancelled my Audible Account and now I will purchase the books through Kindle. Just frustrated, because you would think they could make this seamless! Too Good to be true."
P. Cook,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This kindle hasn't worked right since the day it arrived. I've called to complain about it 3 times and tried to have it replaced. They want to work with me first. So they reset it and I had to set it up completely all over again. The pages won't turn unless you do it ten times. The font changes while I'm reading for no apparent reason. Sometimes it won't turn on at all even though it's completely charged and the light it green. It's just dead. On the third chat with Amazon, they finally agreed to send me a refurbished one. In other words, someone's reject. I paid for a new kindle that worked. That's not what I'm getting. Do not purchase this kindle. I'm furious with Amazon. There was a time they replaced items that were defective. That is obviously no longer true."
Heather,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from the Kindle Keyboard and I really enjoy this device for reading books. I got the one with ads, and I do not mind them at all. If anything they help me figure out what is popular.

The back light is okay for reading in the dark, but I do wish that it was a warm light rather than a cool tone.

I haven’t quite gotten the hang of turning the pages that well. The screen and bezel are flush so I find that my finger slips and I accidentally turn pages quite often.

The battery life is amazing. I only charge it once a week and I read every day from 1-4 hours. I only use the device in airplane mode and with the light turned off unless it’s completely dark.

I still think this is worth it because of the battery life and it is great for reading books. I borrow all my kindle books from the library and it’s a breeze. The device feels nice to hold in your hand and I enjoy the bezel around it. I got the matching leather case and it just looks lovely. It fits in my handbag and is convenient to use on transit or wherever I please."
Brian,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite has opened many doors for me and it continues to be my go-to gift to my friends and family. It has rekindled, if you will, my passion for recreational reading. Its light form factor makes it comfortable to hold and easily portable. All the books on your reading list can fit right in your bag. The e-ink display makes it comfortable to look at for long periods of time. And ordinary tablets' battery life pales in comparison to the Kindle. You can become the person you want to be by learning from those who have recorded their wisdom in writing. You don't have to continue telling yourself the same story about your life. Learn from those who came before us. Read like your life depended on it. Because it does. I cannot recommend this product enough. The fact that it is a dedicated reader and not a general, multipurpose tablet allows the user to focus on reading and not dick around on the internet."
"Blondie, Esq.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third kindle and my first paperwhite, and it’s a fantastic upgrade. The built in light is a great feature and you can turn it off to save batteries when reading in well-lit areas. The battery life is far and away the best upgrade from my last kindles. One charge lasted me over two weeks of daily usage and it charges very quickly. The only thing I don’t love is the touch screen; it’s very sensitive and it’s hard to hold the kindle with one hand without accidentally touching the screen. Highly recommend this device if you’re in the market for a new e-reader.

Updated: I bought a LOVEHANDLE universal grip and it’s a perfect combo. It’s easier to hold and to turn pages."
Holger William Lund,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Since I had to replace my Kindle (this last one strayed from its owner and the others were out of warranty and damaged. ) I thought the Paperwhite would be a good choice and I was right. It has taken a little time to get used to using the screen for all operations except charging and some on-off operations. My age makes using the on screen keyboard a little cumbersome but cell phone users should have less of an issue with this. It would have been nice to get an power outlet charger but I have others.

I would recommend buying a case to protect the kindle. I bought the Amazon cover and believe its worth the expenditure."
Nikki,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle. My nook was getting old and needing replaced and after a couple months going back and forth on the decision, I added this one to my Christmas list with a heavy hint to my husband. Overall, I'm really happy with it. I love how it feels in my hand as it's slimmer than my nook. This is my first ereader with a backlight and I like it much more than I thought I would.

My only issue is that it's running slow. When I tap on the home screen, it takes a second to respond and load the new page -- which is what made me upgrade from my original nook. It was slightly disappointing to find that a brand new device held the same lag my years-old device, so I'm hoping this is something that's fixed in an update (if that's how Amazon works. I don't know, this is all new to me).

I also made it two days before I paid to get rid of the special offers. Not only do the ads show up as the 'screensaver', but there's a banner at the bottom of the home screen. That more than anything bothered me enough to pay for the upgrade and I'm happy I did it."
M. SanLuis,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I “upgraded” from the Nook Simple Touch which was much older but had a mini-SD card reader and page buttons which is probably almost a decade old. This model can be had for cheap used. I was sorely disappointed with this Kindle.

I purposely got it for Audible, expecting that it will work the way the iOS app works where it highlights the word along side the Audible audio. But no. This device will only let you one or the other!! You can read only or listen only. How dumb!! For such an expensive device, when the iOS and Android app for free can do even more.

Also, the battery life sucks!! It died in a week. My Nook Simple Touch last for like two weeks.

In addition, when you try to wake up the device it takes forever to do so. What the hell?

For such a pricey device this so sorely disappointing. I will probably go to Kobo or another BN device. Amazon has done poorly. We didn’t need waterproof. We needed page turn buttons and a more reliable and better reading and listening experience."
Marguerite Thomas,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was promised a phone number with the kindle and did not get one...I was promised instructions and did not get one. I am 78 and do not understand technology...I finally got it working and looked up instructions which were very hard to understand....I find it turns off at unopportune times and had a cord that attached to my computer....I had to order an adaptor...this product is hard use...esp. trying to find a page I was on.....why can't I talk to someone who can help who speaks English to an very good customer who is 78 years old????????
CBarberJD,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the reader. My personal druther would be it be a bit larger (larger, unlike the other models I have seen. As is, it is barely larger than my cell phone. Of course the phone cannot touch the battery life....or, even reading from the readers e-ink).
One gripe seems unique to me from what I have read, but I do not find the interface to be all that good. Perhaps I am too accustomed to how the Kindle software works on my other devices (phone, tablet, notebook), but on the Kindle reader, the touch screen seems hinky and the software clunky and not all that easy to use. It's the setting up and even selecting different books from my library that kinda sucks. Scrolling can be frustrating.

The other gripe can’t be as unique to me. The placement of the power button is awful. It’s along the bottom edge of the frame. If you are holding the Kindle with one hand, as you often would want to do, you will find yourself resting it on your fingers, which happen to be right where the power button is thus turning off the power in the most natural one handed holding position. This is simply poor design and the designers should have known and done better. More than passingly aggravating....reinforced every time you must modify your grip.
That being said, the actual reading experience is pretty damned great."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Paperwhite. I read a lot and a much as I love the library and the feel of books, this little beauty is easy to carry around. I also like to be able to get the definition of a word instantly with the dictionary feature that you access with the touch of a finger. Additionally, it does not have the glare when you read outside (as I do when lolling like a sloth in my hammock). I was reading my books on the Kindle Fire but it is heavier and does not have as long a battery life. The only criticism would be that after an hour or so of reading, my hand gets tired and you must be careful that a finger doesn't touch inside the narrow edge unless you want to turn the page. I highly recommend a cover with a hand strap. Not only protects your device, but makes it more comfortable for those long reads. Enjoy!!"
Pippi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hesitated to purchase an ereader
because I already have an iPad, a Kindle Fire, and Kindle app on my telephone. The product arrived charged and ready to use and is very user friendly. The Kindle Paperwhite is lightweight and small enough to tuck in a purse without adding much weight. The screen is clear and touch responsive. I like it much better than reading on my iPad or Fire because it is much lighter and easier on the eyes.
I admit I have held out because I didn't think I would like the feel of not holding a ""real book."" Not so with my Kindle Paperwhite. The reading experience is so good that I don't miss it at all. In fact, it is preferable to holding heavy books.
I have the special offers, and it isn't offensive at all. When turning on, the first page is a suggested book or special offer. One swipe closes it, and opens to my current page. I am loving my Kindle Paperwhite.
So far, the only downside that I see is battery life. I haven't charged it since receiving, so maybe once fully charged, the battery life will last longer. It arrived with 60% charge, and after setting up the Kindle, downloading some books, and reading one book, I am at 20%."
Bookworman,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded my Kindle Paperwhite in for the 10th generation model in January. Bottom line: if I had to do it over again, I would have kept my old Kindle as the new model is OK but not significantly better.

A common problem with this model is that the battery may not hold its charge for more than a few hours. However, this can be easily fixed by holding the power button for 40 seconds and letting the device restart. You must hold the button for the full 40 seconds or this fix won’t work. Once I did that, the battery was fine."
Randy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE 9/28/2019
After about 3 months of keeping my device in airplane mode while I read every night, my battery is down to 35% after all this time. It really is a great device and I'm happy I made this my first e-reader device purchase. Yes WiFi does bring the battery down when you use it, but if I can have it on moderately and then mostly keep this device in airplane mode to have it last this long, I'll do it.

Original Post:
I picked up my first Kindle on Prime last month. For the most part I have not been a reader and wanted to see if having a Kindle would spark my interest. Man it sure did! I’ve been reading constantly at night now, and even sleep better vs looking at my cell phone screen.

This will be a quick review since there are so many in-depth ones already here. BATTERY life has been AMAZING. Now I will day that I follow to rule that I leave the device in airplane mode unless I am downloading something or updating Goodreads. So far after a month my battery is still at 70%. I can see how battery can drain much quicker by leaving WiFi on constantly. I’ll test this after I see how long it lasts while in airplane mode.

The screen is very responsive. I don’t feel like I am waiting for the device to catch up with inputs. The 300dpi screen is very sharp. I don’t notice a difference from my girlfriends regular Kindle. One person did mention in a review about some pinhole bright spots. I did find one but only recently and I had to look for it to even see it.

Overall I love the device. Definitely would recommend getting the amazon case. Makes it feel sturdy."
JDF,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted a lighted display, and this does the trick. It works great. I was hoping to have a ""page"" that showed me the title and author. This Kindle does not. I never know what I'm reading on a Kindle -- not like a book that shows you the title each time you pick it up. This display will show you page (page 2 of 356 total) or time to a completed chapter (17 min to chapter end). I'd like to see multiple stats, like how many pages left in the chapter and what page I'm on compared to the total number. The absolute worst part is the on/off button. It is on the bottom. I drop it in my purse to take along -- and it turns on. I set it on the treadmill to read and it turns on. Sometimes you prop it up to read and it resets itself because the ""on"" button is pressed and held. It is irritating. I've learned to be careful, but definitely not ideal."
Heidireader,4.0 out of 5 stars,"overall I'm pleased with this, as my last Kindle had gotten very slow in turning pages and was nearly full. This is mostly faster at least as far as turning pages goes, but I find it's often slower in downloading books. I also have far too many error messages when I rate a book. I didn't have that experience with my last Kindle and I don't like having it now.
I will likely never revert to recreationally reading a physical book again for several reasons, but I'm disappointed that Kindles don't seem to last more than 4-5 years. I don't care to have the bulk and weight of a book to deal with, but the need to upgrade every few years is wasteful of materials and my money."
Mickey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always loved the Paperwhite. It's light, easy to carry and fits easily into in your back pocket, unlike the Kindle Oasis. Of course, the screen is such that it can be read indoors or outdoors, in sunlight and at night because of the lights in the screen that illuminate it, unlike the Kindle Fire tablet, which can only be read indoors. My previous problem with the old Paperwhite was that it did not have enough memory to hold all my books (I have 2,451 titles). That is no longer a problem now that it comes with up 32GB of memory. I have all my books in it and still have 19GB free. The battery also lasts for weeks rather than just for hours like the Kindle Fire tablets."
Ken,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have three Kindle readers. I love them. I can read my books and newspaper subscriptions in the bright Texas sunlight by the pool. The newest one is pretty much like the previous ones. It has more memory. It seems to last longer on a charge. But it has one very annoying problem. About once a day while I am reading it comes up with a message box about power. (Hey, it's fully charged!) It offers three options, all of which seem to result in the same behavior. The screen starts flashing between white and the Kindle lock screen. This goes on for several minutes. Finally, it fixes on the lock screen but there is a progress bar that acts like it is rebooting. This takes a while. Eventually, it takes me back to my home page, where I can click on the book I was reading. Then it takes a while to get going on the book and the page I was on when this event occurred."
Josué,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I bought a couple of years ago a Kindle, but one of the reasons I ditch it and started reading more on my Note 8 was the crispiness and posibility to read at night. Then, Amazon updated their kindle app on android with a redesign and well, I started reading even more, with consistency this year.

But now, the Paperwhite is such a great product, crisp screen, bluetooth, water resistant and backlighted. The 8gbs of memory is ok, I never fully loaded my old kindle of 4gbs but is nice now that audible is better integrated within Kindles.

Great overall product, if you can get it discounted on Black Friday or cyber monday, the better. Is better value than the cheapest Kindle."
Debra S. Hunter,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is perfect for me. I love the fact that there is no glare and it's perfectly easy to read in the bright sunshine. I can also turn the brightness down and read in bed without disturbing the hubs. The touch screen is a little laggy, but I don't care. My main purpose was to be able to take several books with me and to see well when reading outdoors, and it suits these desires perfectly.

I love the Libby app for checking out free library books, as well!!

The size and weight of the device is perfect. Very convenient to change the font size however I want it, even changing the contrast from white background/black type to black background/white type. I really do love everything about it (except that darn power button on the bottom--should be on the side, like a phone).

Very happy with my purchase!"
Chris Hanson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite feature of this Kindle is the backlight which makes bedtime or other low light reading really comfortable! It's equally easy to read in full sun of course.

I was a bit unsure of the lack of side buttons (which I was used to on my much older Kindle), but I've easily become accustomed to the screen tap zones. Basically, you tap on the screen almost anywhere to turn to the next page. If you tap on the far left margin you can go back a page and if you tap on the very top you see the main menu. You can also swipe, but since the display is e-ink and updates slowly the tap seems more intuitive than does the swipe.

I also like the fact that is is at least water resistant. They give lots of instructions about what to do if it is actually submerged and basically say that it will likely survive a submersion but don't guarantee that it will. I feel comfortable enough with it's water protection to read in the pool or tub with no intention to submerge the Kindle. I am comfortable that it could easily handle the stray splash that may hit it.

The Goodreads compatibility is also a nice feature for this device. My wife uses that service more than I do, but this integration may lead me to use it more as well."
Sparky's Mom,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using my iPad with the Kindle app for reading. It works fine but impossible to see in the outdoors unless it's cloudy. Planned a trip to Cancun and needed an e-reader that I could read on the beach. This was perfect! Was able to read in bright sunlight. It is lightweight and easy to read on. I still am learning it and have a few things that annoy me like the highlighter pops up and it cuts off easily when I touch the screen wrong but those are minor issues to me. I love my Kindle!!
Donna Wallace,3.0 out of 5 stars,I love that I am able to use this for Audible books. The built in light is great. The paperwhite is light and comfortable to hold. The battery life however is ludicrous. If I turn the paperwhite off and let it sit for more than 3 days the battery goes so dead I cannot even turn it back on until I charge it. If I read for more than an hour I have to charge it. I have a Voyage e-reader and the battery life is at a minimum 4 times longer.
Deb,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This device is extremely light, very thin, and has a nice back to it which is not slippery. Great buy at $99. I can read for hours and this device is great for that purpose. I have the Kindle 10 inch but my hands get tired from propping it up for an hour of reading. With this device I can read for as long as I want."
cathy k,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have owned Kindle Paperwhite for years. My old one was still working but some of the LED lights were not as bright. Unfortunately I had to return the Kindle Paperwhite I got as a Christmas present. It was not working correctly. The problem was with the LED lights. I noticed that in some of the letters in some Words in my books were much lighter in black shade. It was irritating. I called customer support and was sent a new kindle. This one I am writing about so far seems ok. We will see. I Iove the kindle Paperwhite. You just have to be careful with the level of brightness at night. If the LED lighting is too bright late at night it will “wake “ your brain up. For me I don’t want that when I am reading before going to sleep. I just make sure the brightness is around 12-14 and I read for only about 1/2 hour - 45 mins. These actions seem to stop the LED lights from “ waking “ your brain. I would give the kindle a 8 out 10. I do wish it were in color. As some books you need color.
N.Y.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The screen is smaller then I thought it would be(4 3/4""X 3 1/2""), It appears Amazon is measuring diagonally to say that it is a 6"" screen which I assumed it would be length wise. The home page is just too busy. It should show just the book one is reading only. Last I was hoping that I could put a custom picture on the home page as a back ground not possible. Also there appears on some pages a number under words in light gray which I do not know what that is for.
Now the positive. Kindle's library is much more extensive then Barnes & Noble when it comes to the books I like to read, that is why I purchase the kindle(I have a Nook Color). Down loads are very easy and they appear on the reader very fast. As to page turning, one taps the page in the middle or taps on the inside edge of the page to go back. Reading the pages is easy on the eyes. Battery life is very long (Nook doesn't come close to it), about a week of reading every day if not more.
It is very compact if that is what one is looking for, it is not book size.
It is an OK E-reader"
Linda Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It doesn't get much better than this! This is one of the best things I have bought for myself all year! It's lightweight and easy to hold. It has perfect light that doesn't strain my eyes. I can read it in the sun with no glare. The size for me is excellent. It's so easy to take with me wherever I go. Once I learned it, it is easy to use. The charge lasts so long! I would recommend watching a few Youtube videos if you are new to Kindle on this one. I am new to this and this really helped me. Also... I would recommend buying the true Kindle brand cover for it. It fits perfect and the colors and texture of it is so appealing. I couldn't be happier. LOVE this!"
susan yonamine,5.0 out of 5 stars,I think this new generation Kindle is great! I read a lot of the one-star reviews and I'm not having any issues whatsoever. The battery life lasts well and I read a lot so that made a huge difference.
TJL,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my first Paperwhite, it is the best kindle in my opinion, as it can easily be read outdoors or in the dark with its backlight. I have several audible books as well and hated that I had to carry another device if I wanted to alternate between listening or reading. So when Amazon offered to upgrade while running a special, and give me a trade-in allowance for my previous edition, I did it. I am very glad I did. I can't really feel the difference in weight, though it is lighter, but the upgrade gave me a 300ppi screen, which is notably better than my 1st edition, as well as the Bluetooth, extra storage, and it's waterproof. Since I don't read in the tub, I'm not certain that will be important, but you never know! I really love my new 10th edition Paperwhite."
Diana Kilgore,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been reading on a tablet since my first generation Nook died many years ago and decided to try a Kindle. I love this thing, it's so much easier to read on this than a tablet. The set up was easy and getting a few months of Kindle Unlimited is a nice bonus. I've already read two really good books from that collection. I got the Kindle Paperwhite with the special offers and honestly I don't have a problem with the ads at all. They appear when the Kindle is asleep, much like wallpaper on a computer and some of them are pretty interesting. The only MINOR complaint I have is when you turn a page, it's a little clunky. Not a big deal, just not something I'm used to after having an Android Tablet.
I would definitely recommend the Kindle Paperwhite!"
Marie Cone,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perhaps I missed where it may have said that all titles and text and book cover photos are all BLACK AND WHITE...my mistake on that..I do miss the color for books etc...but I am SOOO loving the LONG battery life...2 weeks min and I literally read a min of 1 to 4 hours a day...loving it so far ..still have to figure out how a couple of things work differently than the Kindle Fire ...but overall much much happier with the paperwhite model..
Erma atoui,5.0 out of 5 stars,Okay so I had the kindle voyage and it started messing up i was hesitant on getting this new paperwhite because of all the reviews about the battery life and the flaws that everyone was posting about the new paperwhite not that im saying that they weren't ture but well I ended up Purchasing the paperwhite while it is a bit different then my voyage but i love the new paperwhite it seems flawless in my eyes the battery life seems to be about the same as my voyage I honestly dont see any difference in the battery life all though i havent used the bluetooth yet but just like my phone when the bluetooth is on it does waste my battery faster so im sure the bluetooth would be the same on my kindle anyways Im loving my new kindle paperwhite and i hope that this review will help others make there decision on whether to purchase this item or not
J. D. Kim,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve owned about 4 different kindles. This is by far my least favorite due to the location of the power button. If you’re reading a book, how do you hold the book? I’d say almost everyone would say either at the side or the bottom of the book. In some iterations of the kindle it’s towards the top, or behind the kindle, and also recessed where it’s harder to hit it by accident. For this kindle, someone decided it was a great idea to put a large protruding button on the bottom of the kindle. It’s really a nuisance.

Everything else on the kindle works like they should. But in my opinion this is one device that I’d be really happy with if it just stays out of the way and just let me read books. It’s this device’s one job, and it can’t do that without getting in its way."
Mark B.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received my new “upgraded” paperwhite. I decided to upgrade because my older paperwhite was becoming less responsive and crashing periodically. The 10th generation paperwhite was advertised as an improvement. It may be in some respects. But it is definitely a downgrade in two areas important to me. I had downloaded and frequently played a couple of word games. Games can not be played on the new paperwhite. Another downgrade is that one can no longer see collections and books not added to a collection in the same location. You can see your collections. Or, you can see all your books in a long list. Not both! These downgrades are particularly irksome, and I would have waited for a better product version if I had known these features have been taken away.

August 2019 - I want to return a book for a refund, but the feature on my old Kindle that easily allowed me to return a book for a refund seems to be missing from this new product. Again, the software is disappointing."
rich584,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently installed a hot tub and looked forward to reading my Oasis in it. That worked well for a couple days and then the Oasis started locking up in the tub. Never was in the water, was not wet. The Oasis was expensive and I didn't want to ruin it so I purchased a Paperwhite, yet another ""waterproof"" Kindle. Same thing happened. I called Amazon support and was able to return the Paperwhite along with the case I bought for it but I still see ""waterproof"" on the Amazon offerings. All I can go on is my experience, let me say this one more time, neither the Oasis or the Paperwhite are waterproof! This is a situation that needs to be fixed.

Rich"
L. Gough,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm admittedly a big fan of most things Amazon. I've had a Kindle since generation 2. Amazon has grown enormously since its beginnings, when it might have needed to use its devices as a platform for ad revenue. No one could seriously argue that Amazon needs to plaster product ads all over its devices any longer. That's what's so objectionable about the organization of Kindles now. Amazon, your engineers have crafted a wonderful, tough, light and easy to use device at a solid pricepoint. PLEASE please stop dumping so many ads into it that I can't find my own media on it. PLEASE please get rid of Special Offers, or at least keep them away from the user's own media."
PhantomTiger,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My battery just died on my 2 yr old WHITE Kindle 3G and now on my BLACK 10g Paperwhite, I find it difficult to plug in the micro usb cable. No problem, I'll just get a white one. BUT WAIT! There is no white version where one could more easily see to plug it in. With the case on the Kindle, the usb micro port is virtually invisible to my old eyes."
Mary M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start with the fact that I adore my Kindle. I take it with me pretty much everywhere and use it constantly. I got the new one to replace my previous Paperwhite, which I dropped in the intracoastal (😭). If you're on the fence, I would wholeheartedly recommend it, especially if you haven't had an e-reader before.
Some things to keep in mind:
- If you use it for several hours a day, every day like I do, you'll still only charge it once every two weeks or so at the most. It lasts on any trip I go on without having to worry if I brought the right charging cord.
- It charges via microUSB, which are pretty much always around
- There's a feature to save battery further by letting it take slightly longer to start up. I usually keep that on.
- I both use Kindle Unlimited and regularly send documents via email (usually fanfiction) and have never had issues getting it to sync and show up new items quickly
- The size is good, it fits comfortably in your hand but is large enough to read easily.
- The choices of font and size are great, and the screen clarity is good. It's capable of being much brighter than I think I would ever need it to.

Cons:
- It does have some pretty serious lag, even after it's started up. It can take between a second and maybe 15 seconds to get between screens (usually under 3 seconds or so, but it's noticeable). This doesn't really bother me, but when you're used to the instant response of smartphones it can be frustrating. I also keep a lot of stuff on mine and am regularly adding/returning things, so I think that doesn't help (I believe a lot of the lag is related to indexing).
- Getting the collections all sorted, especially coming from another Kindle, can take a bit and isn't particularly intuitive. Once it's done, it's very easy to get to everything however."
alorett,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly I thought the Kindle was pretty decent for reading. The interface is dated and the touch screen isn’t very accurate. Bluetooth wasn’t very refined, took some convincing to connect and stay connected. The device was reliable and the battery life was great. Until it wasn’t. Mine went completely dead 12 days after the warranty expired. Amazon customer service was a myriad of transfers and repeating the same information over and over. In the end they offered me a small discount on a new one and I declined. In fairness, yes - the warranty is only one year. So the review is getting two less stars because of reliability and frustrating customer service. But I consider it a pricey device for only a year’s use. We have another Kindle that’s still going strong after six years."
Catherine A. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There really nothing to dislike here. I have all the Kindles, beginning with the Kindle Touch. My favorite is the Kindle Paperwhite, so when they upgraded this, I had to get it also I wanted it in case one of my other paperwhite's wore out. But they're still going strong, as is the Kindle Touch, the oldest.

This Kindle is even smaller than the last generation of Kindles, and so light. I love it. I haven't used it much yet, but have charged the battery as soon as I got it and experimented a little.
I bought the leather case to go with it and I love the way it fits in there too.

I'm so glad I got this Kindle and recommend it, if you do a lot of reading like I do. In fact, I read sometimes for hours a day on it,."
Allan C.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"..IT’S THINNER!... IT’S NOW WATERPROOF!... ITS BATTERY NOW LAST WEEKS!... and yet IT DOESN’T COME WITH A C.H.A.R.G.E.R.R.R...

What a bummer.

I’ve ALWAYS BEEN A FAN of MANY AMAZON-BRANDED PRODUCTS.

Sadly not so much this one.

For a company like Amazon to poorly represent a product that is unmistakably a legacy product bearing their brand - I am very disappointed! Not sending all the necessary equipment as part of a package (and NOT NOTIFYING CUSTOMERS BEFOREHAND!) destroys the allure of a product that you vehemently try to sell as a reliable item! It’s like you throw accolades of how good a sports car is and how great it would look like in your garage.. BUT IT DOESN’T HAVE A GAS TANK!!! OOPS! YOU HAVE TO BUY IT SEPARATELY!!! OTHERWISE.. you’re going to have to lovingly push it into your garage.

Amazon. You can do better than this."
Nina,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had some version of the Paperwhite for several years now, and this is another great version of it. The last version I bought was the Paperwhite generation 7, which I was very happy with. My husband wanted to upgrade me to the latest model, and there are some nice improvements, such as being waterproof (haven't tested that out though) and I like that the screen is no longer bezeled. Besides that, I really can't say that I've noticed any difference in this generation vs. the past generation I had. If you're on an older model and considering upgrading, I personally don't think there are any big changes that would make this a must-have. That said, if you don't already have a Kindle, this is an excellent model and I'm very happy with it."
fhk,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my 6th generation Kindle Paperwhite for the 10th generation model. I purchased it on January 8, 2019. A month or so later I called customer support because the Kindle would dim out or restart. The rep suggested resetting to solve the problem. That seemed to do the job until it started again. This time (May 13, 2019) the rep told me to send it in for either a fix or replacement. I received the same Kindle back telling me that a reset was done. The same problem exists. While reading the Kindle it will dim out & will need to be reopened. Sometimes a box will appear offering three options to recover. I've decided to just live with the annoying problem. I will say that I never had a problem with my 6th generation Paperwhite."
Kenneth Detweiler,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this mainly to try the Voiceview feature. What a disappointment - it's as if they designed it to be as difficult to use as possible. It is unusable for reading. It's virtually impossible to start reading after you stop - swipe down from the top of the page with two fingers almost never works. If it does start it's from a random location in the screen depending on where you touched, not from where it left off. Completely impossible to turn pages. When you swipe left and right it goes to an unpredictable location (if it does anything at all), sometimes in the opposite direction. Same gesture does something different each time. Even if you get lucky and it starts reading again you don't know why, and it can't be repeated. I can't pack this up and send it back fast enough."
YL,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a Kindle Paperwhite 32GB and received the device with package saying 32GB. After hours of setting the device and downloading books, I found the battery drops quickly. Following some online guidance I checked the ""device info"" and found a space available of 5.37GB (6.23GB after factory reset, see attached photo). It was shocking as the package was perfect before it's opened and I relied on its label that this was a 32GB version. Had I not been concerned with the battery loss, I may never think of checking the storage and I assume 32GB is huge enough to give me no worry about the space.

Then I contacted the customer service for replacement and compensation for incidental time loss. Throughout more than two hours of communication, they changed hands six times. Each time they greeted me and asked for some time to review the conversation above, each time they walked off with no solution and notice, only an automatic prompt that a new guy was taking place.

Although there are a replacement on the way and some refund, I was disappointed by this purchase and the customer service."
A Little Bit Of Everything,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am absolutely livid right now. I just paid this off in July. It is now September. It has quit working completely. In order for the technician to fix it it's going to cost me $79! This is bull crap. I've only had it since March. I was under the understanding that it had a one year warranty on it, but apparently that's only if the charger isn't working they'll send you a new charger? What the heck is that even worth. The sad part is, I rarely use this so it's probably only been used a dozen times. I should have went with my gut before buying this and just kept reading my kindle books on my phone. Lesson learned. I'm never buying another kindle again and I'm in a lot of reading groups whenever someone asks if they should invest I'll will be sure to say hell no!"
Madd Fam,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So this is my second Kindle Paperwhite. I asked for a new one for Christmas because my old one was having issues: restarting suddenly, slow to respond sometimes, Kindle store experience updating, etc. I expected the new one to be a dramatic improvement in speed, battery life, etc. I have to say that while the screen resolution is improved, the speed is somewhat improved, and I have fewer sudden restarts (was surprised to have one at all), the overall improvements were less dramatic than I expected. Battery life seems actually less than my old one, even using trick of putting it in airplane mode. Not a big fan of the ads, though I don’t hate it as much as I thought I would. I haven’t tested the waterproof aspect, though that will be helpful since both my kids are into water sports. And I haven’t tried the audible books yet but am intrigued at the prospect. Just have to pair my headphones. Overall, I LOVE the Paperwhite in general - I am a book fiend and read hours upon hours at a time, so I highly recommend the product. Great screen resolution and dramatically less eye strain than with backlit devices. Truly feels like reading a paper book but you can read in the dark! I just expected a more dramatic experience with the 10th generation product as opposed to my old one."
Pam B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I kept putting off getting a kindle, since I love books, and couldn't imagine not holding one while reading. Well, I love this kindle! As an avid reader, I am always carrying around several books in different stages of reading - this is so easy - & so light! I've already loaded about 8 books on it; incredible I can carry around all of this writing in just a matter of ounces!! And as I switch so easily back-and-forth between my books, the kindle always keeps my place in each. Love it! Screen is easy to read and easy on the eyes. Delivery was prompt and kindle is great!"
Judy,2.0 out of 5 stars,I do not like this new Kindle as it does not work in the same way as my old Kindle did. Can not get any help either through telephone or email. All the books that I have read I place in Collections - I have downloaded books (paid for) that I want to read in the near future. On the old Kindle you can see them - well on the new format the Kindle puts all the books together and you do not know what is pending and what you read unless you click on every single book. Then they put on the front your wish list with no prices so you will randomly buy books. Not very nice.
Hagow,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Amazon Paperwhite as a replacement for my old Sony PRS-T1 Ereader that died. My concern was whether I could continue using all my non-Amazon ebook files, primarily in epub format. Fortunately, I have found that I can still use my old workflow of managing files using Calibre and uploading them to my ereader. The only two changes I notice are: 1) the upload now takes a little bit longer since Calibre needs to convert the epub to mobi format during the upload process, 2) unfortunately, the Amazon Paperwhite ignores all the organizational tagging I applied to my epub books in Calibre so that they just end up getting dumped into a single flat directory on the ereader. The lack of organization is a bit annoying. I now have to use sorting by author, title, or date to try to find the book I want rather than being able to search by genre.

Some positives I appreciate are: I can now send epub books to my Amazon Paperwhite through email using Calibre or as a regular email attachment rather than having to plug it in. Also, the fact that the Amazon Paperwhite is waterproof means I can now read in the pool or hot tub without worry.

Overall, aside from the annoyance from the loss of organization through Calibre tags, this has been a decent replacement, and maybe even a bit of an upgrade, from my trusty old Sony PRS-T1."
Steven G.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Still trying to figure out how to enable the audible book feature.../ The battery on this Kindle, when reading it every night for about an 1 1/2 hours, will need to be recharged within about 10-12 days. So the description about the battery lasting ""weeks"" before recharging is inaccurate, at best...…

Well I fully charged this Kindle Paperwhite on 2-14-2020 and now on 2-23-20, my battery is almost fully depleted. I have been reading on this Kindle about every other night for about 30 minutes to an hour, and the battery will need recharging within a week. According to Amazon, I am pass the time limit for sending this back. The description of the battery life lasting for weeks instead of hours is not accurate..."
Makaren,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't quite need a replacement for my Paperwhite yet but getting twice the memory was just too much to pass up. I do like it; I don't like the special offers offersa. They are a frustration at times but I finally figured out how to manage around them. My major gripe is that the battery life on this is much less zaftig. My previous Paperwhite would run for weeks before I had to recharge it. This one although I will get several days, I'm going to have to stay on top of it which is something I haven't had to do before because I read ALOT. And this is with the wifi turned off. Getting several days out of a charge might seem like a small price to pay for the memory but it's a frustration for me. For this reason I'm keeping my old Paperwhite handy."
Novelist,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery life is not quite what they claim, but then they are probably measuring battery life in stand-by mode which is rather useless. Still, I read for a half hour or so each night and the battery will get me through a week or more before I charge it. I did actually drop it once in my whirlpool, rapidly retrieving it and wiping it off. No ill effects at all! It is light and easy to handle. Some commented the power button was too easy to hit, but I've not had that problem as it sits off center on the bottom edge and does not interfere with how I hold the Kindle. I don't have a case and I don't think you need one if you are just reading at home like I am."
Deb Shinder,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace my older Paperwhite, which I passed down to my husband. I like that the new one is a bit thinner and lighter, and I don't have to worry about getting it wet. However, it doesn't get five stars because the touch doesn't work nearly as well as the older model. I often have to try 2-3 times to get the page to turn, and sometimes with just one touch it will skip 2 pages, or go to the previous page even though I was very much on the right side. That makes it annoying, especially when I'm reading on the treadmill. Otherwise, it's great.

EDIT: Another annoyance is that it takes a while to ""wake up"" when you turn it on. The older version was ready to swipe almost instantly but this one is slow. You have to wait while it says ""waking Kindle"" before you can swipe to unlock it."
kendyZdad,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the Paperwhite screen, but it doesn't seem to be much improved over the last one I had. It's the same except that there's no edge now, which is different but not better or worse. I guess waterproof is better, but since I never got my old ones wet that may not be a feature I need. I also don't really need it for audio books since my phone is smaller and more convenient.

I'd give my last Paperwhite 5 stars, and this one only 4 because Amazon instituted a wake mode so it takes longer to get to the book than with the old one. The battery also -- though this is only an impression -- seems to lose power faster, so it has to be charged more often.

So, in short, if you have a last gen Paperwhite that works just fine, there's no need to spend money on this one unless you need it for audiobooks."
Walter Basil,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading all the negative reviews of this particular model I was quite nervous about ordering. In fact I put it off for 9 months. On Prime Day with the additional savings, I pulled the trigger and got the leather cover as well.

The ""glare"" is exactly the same as my Kindle Paperwhite 2nd gen. In fact, it appears and feels to be the same material, it just covers the entire device instead of having a bezel/frame around it.

I don't notice any bad spots or pixels. the touchscreen is much more responsive than my other paperwhite due to capacitive touch instead of resistance. Excellent job Amazon!

My old paperwhite will not be enjoyed by my niece."
Liz B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned another brand of reader for many, many years, but wanted to switch to a kindle to take advantage of my prime membership offers. I am VERY impressed with the size, weight, and light on this reader! I was really concerned about the “Special Offers”, but I’m SO glad I didn’t pay the extra to not have them. It’s no big deal!! It’s only pictures of books that are being offered, they disappear as soon as you swipe to Unlock the kindle. My only complaint is that several of the books I have purchased do not show the page numbers, only the percentage of the book that you’ve read. This can be very frustrating if you want to go back and forth between pages."
Joseph Siciliano,1.0 out of 5 stars,"You Wanted a picture! Here is your picture. The latest Paper White has been hung at 'Waking Up..' for over 2 hours. What are you (Amazon) going to do about it to make this right? Based upon your non-reply to my earlier email about it turning off, I'm betting not a damn thing.

Earlier today, I was reading on it and turned off. I came back a few hours later, turned it on and it has been stuck in the 'waking up' mode for the last 90 minutes and I there seems to be no way to reset it.
As such, I am going to return this latest Paper White because it is garbage. Between this and the fact that it constantly turns itself off, this latest PaperWhite is a piece of JUNK that I can neither use nor trust to work properly."
Smart&Frugal,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this with hope that the 300 dpi would give better clarity ( no fuzzy letters ) than the Kindle fire HD at 160 DPI. It did not. I coulndt tell any difference between the two in that regard.

The Pros: smaller and light weight,
32 GB of storage,
battery life was GREAT!!!!!!! after charging to 100% it lasted 4 days at about 6 hours a day of
reading AND powered on the whole time, i was at 22% on the 4th day.
Lots of fonts, and tons of adjustments you can make to how you like your settings

This was the first PAPER white if bought and I was more happy with my kindle fire HD. Thats my choice, Its a nice little reader just not for me"
Marcheta M. Fitzsimmons,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this Kindle. The only thing I wish was different is that I wish a written paper with directions came with the reader. I'm getting all these emails (too many) about different things to do with how to 'operate' it but I'd like to have a paper I can hold in my hand and read while I try to figure out how to fully use the reader. After so many emails, it just makes me not even want to open them to see what its saying next about the use of the Kindle."
kindle reader,5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: After a few adjustments, I'm very happy the kindle paperwhite. It is more powerful and downloads much quicker. I keep it in airplane mode and the life of the battery is pretty good!

Now I can say I am very happy with my kindle again!

----------

This one is a little different and that's okay. I'm getting used to it. But my Gen 6, that I regrettably sent back credit, had a battery that lasted a lot longer. I'm playing with settings but if I can't get it last more than a few days, I will send it back.

I'm a huge kindle fan. I've loved them for years and years. So this is an important piece of technology for me."
Kayleigh,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the kindle but amazon did not include the correct charging cable. For this price, I would think I should be able to charge the device."
Diana Doring,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older Paperwhite that only had 4 gig of memory. I have so many books thateven though they were not all loaded onto it, what I did have loaded slowed the device down to where I really didn’t like using it anymore. Also, I had gone through several of the waterproof plastic zipper sleeves just to read while taking a hot bath. I Received this new one for Christmas and I just LOVE it. No more waterproof sleeves. And at 32gig, there is no problems loading ALL of my books an it still runs smooth and fast. If you love to read, this paperwhite is a must!"
OHXPerine,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been a big fan of the kindle for years, as I’m relieved of the extra weight books and interruptions from alerts on my phone or tablet while reading. I use Audible and the ability to sync between the audio book and my kindle is phenomenal and pricy! Please offer better pricing when you purchase both.

I do have a few gripes with regards to the touchscreen. While it gets the job done for turning pages, buttons would be nice without the outlandish cost of the retired Voyage. The touchscreen can be slow or unresponsive when navigating the menu or settings. This could just be more noticeable as I transition between devices, but I would love to see an improvement, as this is my 5th kindle purchase from 4 different generations (Kids & gifts). Between the design, price, and available books there’s really no competition."
CHH,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I received a paper white Kindle for X-Mas. Switching over from my old unit to the new has not been easy. I am still working on an item rating the book at it's end of reading, that seems to be locking up. I have read the Kindle paper white users guide #7 but not the #8. I am also finding that most people that sell the Kindle do not have the first understanding of them. The Staples tech person I asked was also not informed. I also note that the new unit (4.5"" x 6.5"") is not as easy to hold with my large hands as the old (4.75"" x 7.5"") although the screens are almost the same size. It much easier to carry the new paper white. This will all get worked out."
john addison,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everyone wants BIGGER, when small is so much more beautiful. This aptly applies to the Kindle Paperwhite. Although I do have large hands, the Kindle Paperwhite fits easily in my wife hand. She can hold it between her pinky and index finger securely. It weighs NOTHING. The screen is truly anti-glare and smooth to the touch. I suggest spending an additional 25 bucks for a cover. I can not attest to the waterproof claim. But I will say, I can change my font; I can increase or decrease my font size; I can darken or lighten my font; I can change the back screen to white or black and the corresponding font as well; I can read at night comfortably, in any position; Lastly I can get dam near any book cheaply which has returned, with pleasure, my veracious reading appetite. I have already consumed three books in the last 8 days, and I am well on my way to six more titles. Finally, my wife doesn't get on my nerves anymore, because mentally I am at Margaritaville with hanging out with Jon Steinbeck. Get One, you'll see."
Shane Hansen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had multiple Kindles and this is by far my favorite! It’s light to hold, no arm cramps after reading for an extended period, the backlight is perfect, the memory is fantastic, and the battery life is unbelievable. I really like the ability to use Audible when driving.

The only two cons, and they are minor, are the touch screen can sometimes be slow to respond and the area at the top that you touch to bring up the main menu is sensitive. The touch to turn a page can be easy to look past but the menu selection is annoying. Maybe future models or updates could change it to a “swipe down” to bring up the main menu."
Mary in Brooklyn NY,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle is something I wanted. My library let me borrow theres and I liked it which made me purchase.
I'm NEW to Kindle. I don't know how to use its' features other than to order and read a book.
I have no use of dictionary, I have no use of notes, List of books I've read or wish to read. I don't know how to use its features. Give me a Damn Book! ….I know there is a digital guide. I find it time consuming and hard to navigate. I much rather have the booklet so I can view and learn several issues at once. I think your consumer should have the option of receiving a booklet if they want. Give us that choice. Let me know it is not always about the dollars $$."
Jerre Batson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Paper white has been my favorite since it's introduction. Easy to read, no glare, no need for lights on in bed, compact and holds a boatload of books (currently 595 books in mine) ... New get 10 paperwhites are faster one warmup and page turning. The charge is long lasting ... it'l last a week using it a couple of hours a day. Make the font as large or small as you like. Get a cover (wort it) and it automatically turns the ebook on and off. The only down side is it's not color, which is okay with me for most of my reading is straight up text. Tired? close the book. Next time you open it, you are at the same place in the book. Fall asleep reading and it will shut itself down after a period of inactivity. The backlight and font are completely customizable in brightness and font size. Love it. Highly recommended software to control your library on your mac/PC is called ""Calibre"" ... look for it at the App Store."
Michael Bender,4.0 out of 5 stars,"People should know or be told that Amazon removed the text-to-speech option for documents. I used that a lot, and I had expected it to have improved, but it's gone!"
fivearrows,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to have a “disposable” eReader for the beach. Not really disposable, but I’d be a lot less upset about having this stolen than if my iPad Pro disappeared. I previously had a Nook Glowlight which was extremely poorly made and more trouble than it was worth. When the front bezel fell off the Nook I replaced it with this Kindle. It’s a big step up but not perfect.

My main frustrations: it’s slow to wake up. Setup is awkward, especially for WiFi. Amazon puts ads on the lock screen and sometimes they are for books that are mildly embarrassing. The biggest frustration is the location of the power switch. It’s on the bottom so I can’t prop it up on the table to read — that powers it off. When I try to read with one hand I also often turn it off. When I accidentally turn it off then I am reminded of the slow power on. How hard would it be to move the switch to the top?

Overall it’s decent and I like it, but it definitely has some annoyances. There’s not a lot of competition so it’s probably the best in its price range."
J. Reicherts,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from the previous generation to this 2018 version. I didn’t need to, but passed my older one to someone anyway so it worked out. Only subtle differences between this and the previous generation, waterproofing is nice. And this is unexpected but something I really like- while it has the same screen size, the device is slightly smaller. Whereas my previous gen paperwhite would only fit in some of my jacket pockets, this one is just small enough that I can fit it in the inner pocket of all of my jackets. Easily fits in my back pocket too. (Just have to remember not to sit on it). And, if you’re ever on the fence between the regular Kindle or this Paperwhite, always go Paperwhite. The led lights are sooo worth it for reading at night. Way better than a lamp or booklight."
E. Giraldo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it! It’s small enough to fit in your pocket, but yet it’s like reading out of a book. The paper white doesn’t strain your eyes which is awesome. I love the fact that you can have hundreds of books in one small little device. I love the Word Wise option (even though it could be better). I like that you can highlight a word and get its definition. It has helped me build my vocabulary quicker. For me it was a great investment and it really wasn’t all that expensive. I was lucky to buy during a promotion for $100."
Garwa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is about a 3rd smaller than my original Kindle and may take a bit to get use to. I really love this one though I am not really a fan of touch screen on any device. I guess I am now old. My clumsy hands are learning to stay away from tapping the screen when not wanting to.
The words just jump from the screen and the lighting system truly helps.
The battery life is a dream.
All in all I am very satisfied."
Origami99,3.0 out of 5 stars,"NO continuous scrolling, seriously?! What are they thinking? I get continuous scrolling with my Kindle app on my android devices but can't get it with the Kindle paperwhite itself? I'll be returning it for that deficit alone, but the touch screen also lags and isn't terribly responsive. Oh, and there is no blue light filter. What?! I was so excited to fall in love with this, but I'm crestfallen (if not dumbfounded). Come on, amazonians!"
Catherine S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the second generation Kindle and this is a huge improvement from that old model. I bought this before my second child was born, as I thought I could use it while nursing her in the middle of the night. I have read more in the past two months than I have in the past five years, thanks to this little device. The backlight is bright and the battery lasts for weeks. I have now gotten into the habit of reading before going to bed at night, which has been wonderful. I like the fact that the device is so small and that there are no sharp edges. This makes it a lot safer than a book; especially given the fact that I have a new baby and a toddler who loves to jump around. I bought this device for a specific purpose, and I can't wait to keep reading with it. If you have small children, this is a great device to try."
Kai,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had one of the original Kindles many years ago and had upgraded myself to the Kindle Fire for the ""tablet"" features and then left Kindle altogether for the Samsung tablets. I've recently let go of my Samsung tablets in favor of using a laptop more frequently and wanted to find something simple again for reading my digital books. The Kindle Paperwhite does the job and I'm not sorry I purchased it. There's no real bells and whistles on this one, it does what it is supposed to do. However, the slow response time when touching the screen is a tad annoying and the reason for loss of a star rating. Apart from that, I'm content to be back with Kindle."
Melinda J. Shoop,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking forward to many hours of reading on my new kindle, but found that I was expected to download all of my kindle library one book at a time!! My previous kindle has died due to a battery malfunction, no one seems to be able to fix it. REALLY?!!! So my old kindle is dead with the battery problem, and the new kindle just quit for no apparent reason. No, there is no display except the last page on the new kindle, and yes, the battery was fully charged. The old kindle shows only a display for charging the device. I've spent several hundred dollars on the two devices, and I've got nothing, except several hundred books I cannot read, and a repair bill for the old kindle. Avoid this device!!!!"
Odalys Ortiz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the longest time, I wanted to get a Kindle after losing the many books I had to a fire. After finally purchasing one as a birthday gift to myself as a bundle, I can say for sure that it's worth the price.

One aspect that I love is how no matter where I'm reading, the text on the screen is clear with the light without being intrusive.

It was easy to set up with my Amazon account where I purchased a new book shorty after and it was quite a nice experience being able to pick up and read whenever I felt like doing so.

The device isn't cumbersome at all and with the inclusion of the cover that somehow is able to put the Kindle to sleep when closed and opens up for the flap to attach magnetically so it's not in the way, it just makes for a great experience overall."
Savvy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned my new Kindle for about a month now. I was a Nook Simple Touch with Glow Light (first gen) owner previously.

I wanted to wait to write this review because getting a new device to replace one you've had a long time and use often is always an adjustment and I really loved the functionality and simplicity of the Nook I owned.

All of these things are as I expected them to be:

The Kindle is light, easy to navigate, scrolls easily through pages in a book and pages in the store and in Goodreads. I haven't tested out the waterproof feature but I'm sure it works, similarly I haven't tried out the bluetooth, I'm not sure that is a function I will ever use as I have audible on my phone which is a smaller easier to carry device.

It's a nice device, sleek and clean, light to hold/balance in the hand. Multiple page display options make getting to your reading preferences right. The light operates smoothly and flawlessly and is spread very evenly across the screen and glare is minimal.

I got the Kindle at the cheaper option with the ads on it. The ads largely only appear in the actual store and on your screen saver. They don't bother me at all, I rarely even notice they're there. For me it was worth the $20 discount.

Things I was pleasantly surprised by:

I like that you can simply outright buy all the books in a series in a single click, a simple but nice addition my first gen nook didn't offer unless Barnes and Noble was selling them as a set.

The link between the store and goodreads. It is nice to be able to jump quickly to buy a book on my to be read shelf as I have been an active goodreads member for years and use it to track books.

Things that fell short of my expectations:

The battery life is borderline pathetic for a device of this nature. I'm a regular reader, I've had to charge my device once or even twice a week to keep its battery up. My near ten year old Nook would run a month without needing a charge on the same amount of use. Amazon, what the heck happened? This is honestly just sad.

Secondarily, the functionality of the light is poor. Maybe I'm just missing something but as far as I can tell the only way to activate the light on my Kindle is to use the touch screen. So, in order to use the light on the Kindle I first have to use another, external, light in order to see the screen to turn the Kindle's light on. This is an immense design flaw that I find to be borderline unforgivable. One of the major functions for me is needing to be able to read in bed at night without waking my husband. I can't do that with Kindle. I may not buy another after this device needs to be replaced because of this issue specifically.

And on a more minor but still disappointing note: you can connect to goodreads which is nice but you can't update your reading progress on goodreads from your Kindle. Why not? Even if it wasn't automated and you had to type in your progress it seems like a pretty big no-brainer when you have a reading social media platform you own pre-loaded to your device to be able to update your status. Especially because this is a regular function of goodreads that you can do both through the mobile app and through the website.

I also got the free Kindle Unlimited. I haven't used it even once. For a genre reader like me the service appears to be useless. I will definitely be cancelling before my trial is up.

So, in closing - this Kindle is ok. I expected more overall and I am extremely unimpressed by the light in the device, but it will do. For a $140 device though it doesn't even compare to my old device which was nearly ten years old and cost $99 brand new. That doesn't speak well of you Amazon."
Shoppergal70,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Paperwhite which I bought to replace my 2013 one. I also bought the Oasis which I highly recommend. The Paperwhite is light and perfect for reading on my commute to work. However, after a couple of months (bought in December), the battery started acting up. It said 100% charged in at night. In the morning when I got up, it was at 14%. How can this be when the wifi was turned off along with the Kindle? I had occasional issues getting it to charge which was fixed via an update.

Meanwhile, my Oasis has had zero issues. The light is much better as well. It's not as light n weight, but if you are considering your options, I say spend a bit extra and treat yourself to the Oasis."
Neil Dennis,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my kindle. Can't believe people still buy paper books. I do wish it booted a bit faster when opening (sure - it is only about 2 seconds, but I feel it should be an open and read type of technology). I also wish it was easier to navigate the library and wish list. The front page of the home screen just seems to busy. I wish Amazon would change this. The touch screen is not the greatest but I don't do much screen touching other than to turn a page or pick a book, etc. The battery life seems less than my very old previous Kindle - but the lighting source is different and better and therefore it makes sense. Overall - it is my lifesaver for someone who travels frequently and always has a few books going at once. Also - I can always just change a book on a dime if my interest or mood changes and I love this about the Kindle. A great product."
Mich,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great device for reading. I love that it is super light and that it does not hurt my hands when reading for a long time. The built in light is fantastic and it does not makes me tired when reading, even in total darkness. The problems happen when I am reading for a very long time, the battery is empty after just 3 days of use instead of the weeks that are advertised, this happens even when I block the usage of wifi or bluetooth.

The second problem is with the touch screen, some times when I am sliding to search for new books, the naviation is too slow and one has to be very patient in order not to accidentally tap on the details of an unwanted book."
Popsicle Toes,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally caved and upgraded my 2nd generation Kindle to this paperwhite, and I have to say, I'm not impressed. Had the stupid wifi thing on my 2nd generation kindle was able to work, I probably wouldn't have upgraded it.

This paperwhite Kindle is lighter, but the screen feels smaller than the 2nd generation Kindle. The touch screen function is also clumsy.

Then to top it off, my favorite word game no longer works on this new paperwhite - not even sure if there's any game that works with it."
Alex Green,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This product works as expected, it’s just unfortunate that Amazon’s stranglehold on the E-Reader market has let them skirt by with minimal updates in the last decade.

This product looks, works, and feels like it’s from 2010. And that’s fine I guess. It’s an E-reader, and I’m not sure what they would change. But the small size, slow hardware, and locked-down ecosystem really leaves a lot to be desired.

Want to add your own books? It’s clunky. Want to manage/remove the things you added? Hope you can find the page to do that, you can’t do it from the device. The bezel is enormous, which I guess is to help with grip, but when the screen is as small as it is, it seems like a waste of surface area. The air gap (the distance between the glass you touch and the actual E-ink display) is large and very noticeable compared with modern devices.

So, to;dr: the Kindle is fine. It fulfils it’s most basic purpose, no more, no less. I’d say wait for something better, but there’s no signs of one coming out anytime soon."
Heather,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been wanting a Kindle e-reader for years. When I purchased my first e-reader I went with a Barnes and Noble Nook because, at that time, the Kindle didn't have the option for checking out ebooks from local library. That changed, but by that time I had already purchased a lot of books for my Nook, and didn't want to purchase them again for a Kindle. Having two different e-readers wasn't something I wanted.

However, I finally purchased the Paperwhite. My first impressions are good. Easy to set up. I was easily able to send a library ebook I was currently reading on my phone over to my Kindle. I like the size of the Paperwhite. I think it is comfortable to hold, and it is fairly light.

The ads are not too distracting. In fact, I rather like them so far. The ads may give me ideas on what I should read next.

So far I am really happy with my purchase."
Christina Feigner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to download the app on my phone and then read books off of a small screen. With the Paperwhite I can actually see the full page and hold it more comfortably than my phone. I had never had an e-reader before so this one being my first one, I absolutely love it. The battery lasts a long time. which is great. I love that it is also lightweight too, which is so nice. It hardly takes up any room in my purse because of the fact that it is pretty slim. I am so glad that I invested in one and I also love the fact that it combines being able to download not only books but audio books on it without having to use a separate app for each thing."
amyp,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first e-reader of any sort. As a book lover, I have been very resistant, but decided that due to my frequent travel, I should give it a try. I absolutely love the Kindle Paperwhite. One of the reasons I chose it was because it's waterproof, I haven't tested that yet, but have used it in the pool. It's really easy to adjust the font and lighting. The white page does make for an easy on the eye authentic read. The battery lasts a really long time. Downloading the books takes seconds and it came with 3 months free of Kindle Unlimited. I love the small size and light weight. I purchased a case for it that has an arm that pops out so it can stand, and it's the perfect size for an airplane tray table, I recommend getting a cover like this. All in all, I am very happy with this product and think it was well worth the price."
M. Saunders,3.0 out of 5 stars,The screen is a little on the small side. Overall I would say given the state of electronic devices available in general it’s about average. Given the cost of memory I have to say that I think the item is overpriced. I have had trouble with previous Kindles dying on me after moderate use so I’m not sure how long I’ll get use out of the one I just bought. The primary benefit I get from the Kindle is being able to magnify the text because of my failing eyesight but other than that very considerable benefit I really don’t find it to be a terribly remarkable piece of equipment. I have to say whenever I do business with Amazon I feel as though I am colluding with a corporate monster because I have read so much reliable information about how much Amazon does to destroy the small businesses and create an overwhelming monopoly that kills entrepreneurship.
Java RB,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the fact that it's waterproof and I don't have to worry about it after falling in the tub. I also love the white letters on black background at night. Much easier on the eyes.
Books disappearing from my reader did not happen with my keyboard or 2nd generation Paperwhite. They can be reacquired via 'Content and Devices', but all Notes are deleted. I have hundreds of books and I have a BAD feeling.
My screen seems a little desensitized and unresponsive. A page turn may take several swipes of the thumb, and then go backwards rather than forwards. Highlighting passages gets frustrating. The markers tend not to move right away. The above doesn't happen with my earlier readers.
The low score is because of the six years of notes the should be attached to hundreds of books that may be lost. WTF?"
1020WalnutCreek,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I primarily purchased a new Kindle for the longer battery life and the audio feature. The new features don’t mean a thing when the whole system takes a step backward in its design. This new Paperwhite should have a name change to Papersepia, or Papergray because the new pages look anything but white. There is very little print contrast unless you hike up the brightness to the maximum, which defeats the purpose of having a longer battery time and doesn’t really make the pages look a crisp bright black and white. I find reading black and gray, instead of black and white print very distracting. If you need a Kindle because you have vision issues to start with, this latest version will be a huge disappointment. Sadly returning my new toy. The old one will have to do until someone figures out how to fix this awful new change."
Lydia Montgomery,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this as a gift about a month ago and absolutely love it! . I've always hated reading on an electronic device because the light hurts my eyes, especially if I'm reading in the dark. However, the paperwhite is just like reading a book and the back light is just like having a book light on your paper book. The light is bright enough to be able to read but not bright enough to light up the room and wake someone who is sleeping. It's very gentle on my eyes, which I really love. I also enjoy that it's waterproof. I enjoy reading in the tub/hot tub/ pool side so the comfort of knowing if it were to get wet it would be okay is well worth it."
bethystl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought I would buy a Kindle device, but after talking to my sister and a few others who have one, I began researching and looking for awhile. I decided upon the Kindle Paperwhite, was a bit nervous placing my order, however am so delighted with my purchase! I always loved the ""feel"" of a book but am having no trouble at all adjusting to my new Kindle. It is small and lightweight, yet you can adjust the lighting and the size of the print. I can easily read in bed at night, with or without the light on. The battery life is very long...I've had it for over a week and have not had to charge it yet. It easily fits into my small purse so I can take it anywhere I go. I love the size, the feel, and the weight of it. It is a joy to read on the Kindle Paperwhite!"
mr gorgan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first e-reader and I have mixed feelings about it. The worst thing about it is that I find its search engine in the store or library to be clunky and unhelpful. For instance, look for ""mystery or thriller"" and it brings up hundreds of no-name authors and books that are universally declared to be ""wonderful"" by publisher's weekly, but the really good authors are buried at #87 or 365 of several thousand. It doesn't help to scroll through a thousand books with covers showing men in fedoras, holding guns if what you really want is to find a new author like Ace Atkins or Louise Penny or John Sandford. Yes, you can find books by all of those people but only if you know who you're looking for. Why can't there be a section of NYT best books or some similar guide?
Second, the kindle is both sensitive to touch - changing screens you don't want to change - or refusing to turn the page.
Third, I would be grateful if there were not a new bodice ripper or guy with a gun or alien spacecraft on the opening page every time I open it. (And all of them books I would not read, by the way.)
On the plus side, I like the kindle because I can access great books before I would ever get a chance to get them at the library (as I wait on the reserve list) - books I don't want to own in hard copy but want to read. If I really like an author I'm going to buy the hardback, because I often re-read books I have enjoyed. The kindle not difficult to read from - I find the light less bright than I would like at it's highest brightness, but I like bright white - and most people might find that too harsh.

I'm still getting used to the kindle. I may like it more when I learn how to jump over all of the flotsam and jetsam of the search lists or the library."
simunaya,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Call me crazy, but I bought a Kindle to supplement my Nook. Amazon has some books the Barnes & Noble folks don't offer. And because the two formats are NOT compatible, I decided to split the difference. I won't list all the benefits of a Nook over Kindle, but the Nook has a much kinder format, with page numbers, paragraph spacing, and a way to buy books organized by genre. In addition, you can see suggested books by other authors listed at the bottom of a prospective book you want to buy. There are also ways to easily organize books once you download them. You can also adjust the white scale for reading in different light situations. COMPARE the the two before you buy."
TRC4941,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the Paperwhite but I still miss my 3rd Generation Kindle. It had a keyboard and I was able to play word games on it. That said, I love the fact that the Paperwhite has a built-in backlight for reading at night. It took me a while to figure out how to navigate it, but it wasn't difficult. Just different from what I'm used to. Other than those few things, it isn't much different from my old Kindle. They're great readers. I also have a Fire that I love, but unlike the Paperwhite, it doesn't have a non-glare screen. I do a lot of reading outdoors in the summer. Reading on the Fire outside is IMPOSSIBLE. I use it for watching Netflix in bed or using the internet."
Lizzy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this a lot, although it’s not perfect. My setting sometimes change by themselves (type size, page number) Sometimes clicking back doesn’t work and I have to click over and over again, or I have to go to the previous chapter and click forward till I get to my page. This is actually the same problem I had with my old Kindle. Not much progress in that department. All in all I like it. Remember to keep you Kindle on Airplane mode to get hit with fewer EMF’s."
Clancy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want to read books or manga this is a great device without spending too much, like with the Oasis. If you can wait to get it on sale or buy it used you could save even more. The low storage model is enough for books, if you read a lot of manga or comics go with the higher storage. But the built in features make navigating a large library difficult. Very little metadata is displayed on the kindle beyond author and title. The screen looks fantastic and reading is really effortless. I think it's worth it to get some kind of a case as it can make the device easier to hold. The ads are a pain, I think it's worth it to buy a model with no ads."
Dato,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe a step backwards? This is my third Kindle device. I traded my Paperwhite in for this newer model. The font seems to be clearer on the new device which often allows me to use a smaller font when reading. However I do not like having to swipe the screen to wake it up. The older Paperwhite awoke as soon as I opened the case. I do not like how the font size adjustment has been buried in the settings. I don't the ""Ads"" on the screen when it is sleeping. If I had to do it over again I would have kept the older version."
WDM.Amy,5.0 out of 5 stars,I traded in my old Kindle Touch for this Paperwhite. I got a fantastic deal with the trade-in discounts. I absolutely love the new Paperwhite!! My old Kindle did not have a backlight so it was fantastic in full sun and normal lighting but could not be used in the dark. This new Kindle can be adjusted to have no backlight (like the old Kindles) all the way to full backlight for the dark and everything in between. It is significantly easier on the eyes than my iPad. The best part is that it is waterproof! I finally have something I can take into the hot tub with me and not worry about damage!! I actually tested it and dipped it into the water. No issues! Battery seems to last just as long as my old Kindle (2+ weeks with at least an hour of daily screen time and wifi on).
Malinda Gehlen,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish I had kept my previous Paperwhite, but was excited to trade for this one. I have had this new one for just over a month.
Quite frankly, it is not as good. The battery life and reading light are much worse than my previous one. Hopefully this review will prevent someone else from making the same mistake."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is our 5th Kindle reader and 4th Paperwhite in the family. The new screen on this model is pretty awful compared to the prior versions. I've never filled a Kindle (not even close) so I don't fully understand the need for extra space. I don't like the shiny or flat surface of the new screen, I really prefer my older model from 2012 better. This purchase was for one of the kids so I mainly read on mine and only use this one when I read to him at night. I find myself turning it off by accident almost every night, not a problem with my older version. Sometimes companies need to learn the 'if it ain't broke....don't fix it' rule of life."
JCStuff,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great book reader. I enjoy the internal light source. Great for those late night, don’t want to disturb my spouse reading sessions. Doesn’t cause a headache from having to squint at the light. The battery life is amazing. My only gripe is the speed of the touchscreen. It is what it is though. You can’t expect the buttery smooth response that you will get on other devices. But that doesn’t detract too much from the psuedo-book reading experience. It only becomes an issue when you are perusing through the titles of the other books that you ha e downloaded. Page turning is responsive enough. Very happy with my first actual book reader."
in bloom,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first venture into e-reading technology, and I'm surprised by how glitchy the Paperwhite is. I'm not sure if it's a common problem, or if I need to exchange it. When I try to turn the next page by touching the right side of the screen, it takes me back a page (instead of forwards) at least half of the time. I usually end up giving up after a few attempts, and changing my page view to thumbnail so I can go back. Other times, when I touch the ride side of the screen to turn the page, it does nothing. I either have repeatedly tap, or I have to hit the power button to put it in a sleep mode before waking it up to try again. That usually resolves it, but good grief...how hard should it be to turn a page?? I have tried with both my finger and a stylus.
I want to like it. I really do. But it's been a bit disappointing. :("
jsrw12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Short version:
-Never owned a Kindle? Buy it!
-Have an old Kindle that works? Don't buy it unless you really need the audible support.

Longer version:
I got this as a replacement for my old 2014 Paperwhite that was accidentally damaged. I had no intention in replacing it (it was that good!) and I wouldn't had done it if my previous Kindle had not died.

It may have a slightly better display as my older Kindle, but unless you hold them side by side you won't tell the difference. I'm not into audiobooks, so the 8 GB are not important to me, (you'd need to buy all the books in Amazon to run out of storage 😅)"
Timothy M Eberly,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The length of time to start reading is a little annoying. Disappointed I did not get the 90 days of Kindle unlimited, and could not get the customer service rep to give it to me, when I thought I had selected it and was told since I didn't select it he couldn't do anything about the issue, BTW, he was the 5th person I had to talked via chat. Off-shore customer support makes me wonder if Amazon really cares anymore. Yes, it was my fault I did not select the 90 trial, I thought when I selected 'with special offers' when I bought the new Kindle, that it included the 90 trial. But to not allow me to recieve it by the CSR, was very upsetting and disappointing."
jobe,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated 7/26/19. I actually disliked my paperwhite so much that I traded it in for $30. I was tired of having to restart it almost everytime I returned a book from unlimited or downloaded more than 2 or 3 new books at a time. Also, it restarted itself while I was reading numerous times and frequently gave error messages when I tried to open a new book. My least favorite thing was the random jumps 1 to 5 pages forward or back.

It's a little bit weird that instead of fixing problems with the paperwhite, they added another color it's available in. I always kept mine in a case, so color is irrelevant, actually functioning would be relevant.

Original 2 star review follows: I feel like this model is a huge step back for several reasons:

1. I charge it as often as my cell phone-forget the charge lasting a week, I was excited when my charge lasted 2 days. I had an older paperwhite and I could count on at least a week between charges, now I have a dedicated phone charger and a dedicated kindle charger on my nightstand, both in use every night. One Saturday when I was trying to set it up, I charged it 2x.

2. It is incredibly sluggish. It takes ages to load, it is annoying trying to navigate and it is not dependable. A swipe from right to left may take me forward 1, 2, 4 pages or do nothing. A tap might open the book I want, it might open a random book from that page or a page forward or back, or it might do nothing. Trying to organize my collections just seems futile and is too frustrating. I've been organizing my titles and categories on paper, like a card catalog from an old school library or something.

Honestly, reading on my phone app gives me a headache, but it's less annoying and smoother, so I've been reading on my phone more than I like.

3. In comparison to my old paperwhite, it seems washed out and faded. I keep changing the settings hoping to get it right, but no luck so far.

4. I have audible on my phone; it connects to my car and has headphones in case I want to listen while I make dinner or something. I can't imagine any time I would use audible through my kindle that my phone wouldn't be more convenient. Also, I'm not likely to try to read in the shower, so except for an unexpected cloudburst while reading outside, the water resistance is wasted on me.

I did find a cute cover I like, so that's something, and it fits in my purse better than my old tablet.

Long and short of it though, if I didn't get migraines from reading on my phone too long, and the fact I am completely out of room on my bookshelves or a place to put more bookshelves for paper books, I'd be tempted to return this and wait for something else.

I am very disappointed with my new kindle."
Rock Star,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my 5 year old paperwhite for this newer model. I’m very happy with it - I got the blue backing which is pretty. The unit charged up very fast and I had my whole library quickly loaded without any problem. This is a tiny bit smaller than my other paper white, which I like for carrying around, but I had to also purchase a new case (I love the Omoton case). Waterproof is a huge plus for me. Anyone concerned about getting the reduced price one with the ads shouldn’t worry. The ad is only there when you initially look at the opening screen, but once you open your library and book, the ad is no longer there. Easy was to get $20 off."
Daniel Schackart,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Replaced a Kindle Voyager I lost, and am a bit disappointed with the Paperwhite. It us mostly little annoying things, like the power button. There is just no way to keep inadvertently touching it and causing it to power down, very distracting. The touch screen does not seems as responsive as the Voyager, I read a lot of books with footnotes and it takes a few tries to hit it correctly. And the screen crispness is just ok not great. I do like the lightness of this unit and the battery life has been ok. Overall I like this unit, but not as much as the Voyager. They could fix some of these irritants and provide more features, but I guess since Kindle dominates the market they probably dont feel like they have to."
E.S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I also have an older version of the Paperwhite. WHat I like about the latest version is that I can read the New Yorker on this one and that there is no ""lip"" from the case to the screen, it helps with highlighting test that is on the edge.
A minor dislike is that it takes longer to get started if it has been closed for a while and went into sleep mode. WIth my old Paperwhite, I could just open it up and swipe to unlock, with the new version, I have to wait a few seconds to let it ""wake up"".
The new version was a gift and I enjoy having two e-readers but would not have upgraded otherwise as the difference between the two is not significant for me."
Alpha,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just love this new Kindle Paper White 4
Where to start? Extremely small very easy to hold while reading and super light weight. So glad I went with this over the others out there. I want to address the warm lights not being on this Kindle vs. Others that have them. I really think you do not need the warm lights because It has just the right amount of light to use when it’s dark out. Just my opinion. You will be happy with this purchase. Very nice quality that we all know and love from Kindle."
Floridian consumer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kindles are nice but don't be suckered by Amazon to take advantage of their trade-in program. There are about 20 models of kindles. I spent about 30 minutes trying to match the first 5 alpha-numerics of my serial number to a particular model - that never did match exactly... I answered their short questionnaire regarding functionality. I was told I would receive a $25.00 trade in allowance. Surprise. After returning it I only received a $5.00 trade in. I could have sold my old Kindle for at least $20.00 via Facebook marketplace... Complaining to customer service got nowhere. Amazon will not be my default online source for stuff any longer.
Zennie,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a prolific reader and have owned many Kindles—both readers and Fire tablets. I also have an iPad and a giant smartphone. But I keep buying Kindle products because the text-to-speech feature is awesome for a bookworm like me who wants to keep “reading” but still needs to get a few other things done. Around the time Kindle Paperwhites came out, I switched exclusively to Fire tablets since the Paperwhites did not support text-to-speech. However, between my work computer, the iPad, my giant smartphone, AND a Fire tablet, my stroll through security checks has become a little ridiculous. So when an ad popped up about the new Kindle Paperwhites, I was excited to think that I might be able to at least lighten the weight of my electronics, if not the number of them. There are no less than three portions on this device’s website touting seamless switching between reading and audio.

Well, my new Paperwhite arrived today...and I’m returning it less than 3 hours later. That’s about how long it took me to figure out that the text-to-speech feature has been subsumed into the Accessibility menu and does not operate the way it does on the Fire. You MUST turn on the VoiceView Screen Reader, which, as far as I can tell, does not work very well. It’s actually quite awful. I stopped the reader in the middle of a page, and for the life of me, I could not get it to pick back up again without exiting and starting over. Also, there are only so many times you can listen to the little clicks and tones and the voice saying, “Exxxxit,” before you want to just throw the Kindle against a wall.

For those who are interested in switching between an actual Audible book and traditional reading, there are quite a few reviews discussing how immersive reading on this device is not possible. I won’t further belabor that point.

In all, I’m very sad and disappointed. Back to Amazon this product goes, and I guess I will stick with the heavier, bigger Fire tablets instead."
Jersey Dad,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This e-reader is almost perfect. But a few glaring weaknesses almost makes this a 3 star.
For one, it's what a 2018 device? I hate that it's not USB-C. Still just a minor annoyance.
Another issue is the battery life. It is listed as ""weeks"". Without being touched, it will only last for days. When I use it consistently, I might be able to get a day and half out of it.
The biggest knock for me is the charging situation. I found out the hard way that it only charges with cable that comes with it. I could be wrong on this as I've only used 2 different charging cables but the fact that not just any cable would work, is really annoying."
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the Kindle Paper White except for one glaring issue. At night I like to invert the screen so the back ground is black and the text white. It’s easier on the eyes and similar to the blue shade mode on the small Fire tablet I used to use. The problem with the Kindle Paper White is that sometimes when going to the next page the screen will briefly flash white before going back to the black back ground. Very annoying getting this flash of bright light while reading in bed. I hope Amazon will fix this issue. If not, I am considering returning it."
bearbear,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle (2010) finally quit working and I had to hurry up and purchase the new Kindle Paperwhite for travel. I traded in the old Kindle, new Kindle arrived in 2 days and it was easy to transfer reading material between the two. Also, Amazon customer service was wonderful. Because I had to hurry up and order a new Kindle before they received my trade in, they were kind enough to honor the 25% off the new one. Thank you! I really love the fact it's backlit. This feature was very handy to have on board a plane."
RJS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new kindle. This is my 3rd and I am a fan. Beautiful and functional and works like a dream.

One comment on battery life. Don't believe anything you read on the marketing about it lasting weeks. I received my unit yesterday and immediately charged it to 100%. 24 hrs later it’s at 42%. Not cool. If you get one make sure you have a charger in your pocket. Many reviews said it would last weeks if you didn’t use it. I don't think it would last a week if you didn’t use it.

Otherwise great product."
H,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to upgrade from my 2nd gen paperwhite.
Pros:
The text is much more clear
Touch screen is more sensitive
The page turn is faster
I like that flat surface
Smaller

Cons:
Battery life is horrible compared to gen 2. I do not keep the bluetooth or wifi on yet within the first 7 days I charged the battery twice. The back light setting is the same as I used on my gen 2 and still the battery does not compare at all.
I will not return it but the battery is the major downfall of this device."
Book Lover,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Am pleased with the compact size. It is about the size and weight of a paperback and fits easily into my purse. It was a bit of adjustment in figuring out how to manage my library of books and how to do things since the usage instructions are in the device and I had only used the kindle app on my phone before getting this kindle. I still prefer reading real books, but use this for daily bible reading. It will also be nice when traveling or when I am only able to get e-books from authors I like. Battery lasts about a week or more before I need to recharge and recharges quickly. The adds and special recommendations are mildly annoying and at some point I will pay the fee to get rid of them."
Eileen Pierce,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The reason I bought this new kindle was because it had audio. I am sad to say that the audio is patchy at best, and that is when I am sitting still. Beware."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Only had for a few weeks and it does take some getting use to with having to tap the screen for every function. Coming from a 2nd Generation Kindle with the keyboard, this Kindle takes getting use to. I like that it is smaller and easily packs away in my purse as I like to read where ever I go and it appears to hold a good battery charge. I was trying to figure out how to turn the battery off as I could with my prior Kindle but have yet to figure if this new version will allow or just goes into sleep mode to safe the battery. But I'm learning and reading the manual to get to know this Kindle and use all the capabilities it has to offer. I especially like the built in light and font choices there are this is a plus for me. I've yet to do any audio but I will get to that eventually. Otherwise I really do like this Paperwhite Kindle."
WestcliffeCO,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Read my first novel without a hitch. The screen was great and the size and weight made the Paperwhite a pleasure to use.

Started the second novel, same thing. Then, all of a sudden the page wouldn't turn. Pressed again, same thing. Pressed a third time, same thing. Then pressed multiple times. Nothing. All of sudden, I am deep into the novel and start backtracking one page at a time.

Enough is enough. Life is too short to have to deal with defective technology. I'll just go to the library and pick up a free book that I can hold in my hands and turn the pages, one by one.

This one is going back."
CookGirl-MO,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I tolerated the freezing and tech glitches of this device for 6 months but now the Kindle has completely deleted all the books I PURCHASED. More money wasted on an Amazon product. Do yourself a favor and avoid this product. Since I cannot get any help from Amazon on this (tried chat, tried the call me button, nothing worked) I am cancelling my Prime membership. I have been a member for over 10 years but this is the final straw. No service at all and they leave you hanging. Good bye Amazon."
Eric Su,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my Kindle 8th gen (basic, not paperwhite) and have seen a noticeable decrease in performance between my new Paperwhite and my old model. My 8th gen worked perfectly and I only traded it in because I wanted the backlight and waterproof features of the Paperwhite but I'm wondering if the trade in was worth it.

Turning on my Kindle 8th gen used to take about a second between opening my cover and swiping to unlock. When opening the cover on my paperwhite I am greeted with a ""waking up"" message about half the time before I am able to swipe to unlock, which never happened on the 8th gen. This results in about 5-10 seconds of waiting before I can interact with the kindle.

In addition, my Paperwhite has completely frozen twice since I got it a month and a half ago. The first time happened after only a couple of weeks while reading. The second time was frozen in ""sleep"" mode (on the advertisement screen) after sitting unused overnight.

The backlight and waterproof features are great, but overall I am somewhat disappointed with the Paperwhite. I typically read about 10-15 minutes each way on my work commute and having a slow or unresponsive Kindle is a detriment."
Nadine A Ducharme,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I just arranged return. This was horrible. I had reached the limit of the books I had saved so I deleted about 800 books, which were transferred to the cloud. When I got the know kindle all saved books were transferred all together. I have no way of separating the books from the cloud that I had deleted with the ones I had saved in collections without re-reading them. I did a few and when I tried to delete them they stayed on but twice. Now I have double of books I don't want at all. Other books that identified to keep, I tried to put them into a collection, but they either go in the wrong collection or not at all . The face format the shows front covers of books is stupid. I like the old way of just listing books. The picture take up a lot of room and are different shades of gray that are hard to see. Whoever decided that these changes were beneficial was way off. A kindle with the old format should be available especially for customers who have a lot of books saved."
Miss Julie,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought myself the waterproof Kindle Paperwhite after Christmas. It comes with a charging cord to plug into a computer via a USB port but no adapter to plug it into a wall. I will be traveling without a computer, so I need an adapter. The advice I have found in the “Kindle store” says to get a “Compatible adapter.” There appears to be no way to find out which adapters are compatible. This information is not in the manual, which I printed out, nor is there any listing for TECHNICAL SUPPORT in the manual. So I am on my own to guess. If this complete lack,of support doesn’t bother you, I’m sure it’s a perfectly fine e-reader. But if, like me, you are concerned about buying something that won’t work or, worse, may harm your device, maybe not.

For $5, “just answer” will try to,answer questions. Since they are neither amazon nor kindle, I see no reason to trust their advice."
Donna Brown,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a Paperwhite since they first came out and I loved it. It served me well for 7 years but it started acting a touch wonky. I decided to take advantage of the Kindle trade-in program and get the newest (10th Gen) Paperwhite. So, I sent my old one in (free shipping!) and not only got an Amazon gift card but 25% off a Kindle upgrade. I waited for the Black Friday sale and ordered the Twilight Blue Paperwhite. It is wonderful! Granted, I just got it so I don't know how the battery life will be or how it compares in longevity to my original Paperwhite, but so far I love it. It is noticeably lighter and more responsive. It is a definite upgrade! The Twilight Blue is so pretty and even in a case, you can still see the color around the edges. I am beyond happy with my new Kindle."
meshelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 1st Kindle as I used the Kindle app on my iPhone. It’s all I hoped it would be. My Sister has one & loved hers so I choose this Kindle. It’s just the right size to hold as I read. I love the twilight blue color I choose. My pictures don’t do it justice. It surely is light weight. Perfect weight with no hand strain when reading long term. I love all the features it offers. It was very easy to register to my existing Kindle account & all the books I had in my app automatically appeared with zero problems. I had no problems figuring out the features in setting it up just as I wanted it. Thrilled with this Kindle & highly recommend it!
Jackjelvis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, background. My first and only other dedicated eReader was a Sony eReader about a decade ago. As an avid reader, I was immediately sold on the idea of being able to carry ALL of my books around in a space smaller than a single book. Sure, you had to plug it into a computer to get content on it, but it was still a lot easier than going to the library or bookstore. Maybe the contrast wasn't perfect for all lighting, maybe it was a little slow, but from the day I got that eReader, I have transitioned to where it's pretty tough to get me to buy a physical book. When Sony got out of the eReader biz, my next step was to a tablet or phone with Kindle app, other book apps, and any other apps I wanted. Best of both worlds, right? Sometimes, yeah, but not always. Impossible to read at the beach or pool. My wife actually snapped a picture of me by a resort pool with towel draped over me and my tablet so I could read. So I finally bit the bullet and got only my second dedicated eReader ever, and I'm ecstatic. Of course, I can download books directly (over wifi, but where can't you get wifi nowadays?), it integrates Audible and allows you to switch seamlessly between reading and listening via Bluetooth,. but best of all? I can not only see it clearly in direct light or complete darkness, it's even waterproof so it's perfect for the pool! If you want lots of apps, color screens, and the internet, get a tablet. If you want the best reading experience pretty much anywhere, get the Paperwhite. Tablets just don't compare for reading, and now that it's so inexpensive, I don't know why I waited so long."
BayAreaReader,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Immediately re-boxed it to return. It was so slow and the interface so clunky, I couldn't even read the sample pages. Also the Kindle Unlimited bundle doesn't include any books you actually want to read. All the books you want to read you still have to pay for, even if the price is discounted. The charger doesn't have a real plug, just a USB so you need to also buy the adaptor. The screen is very small and the whole thing just feels flimsy. Much prefer reading an eBook on the tablet (huge) or on my cell phone (small) with the Libby app, free from your local public library. You can check out the eBooks and audio books for free from the library as well."
D. gittens,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the Kindle for it's size and being light-weight. It is very comfortable to hold. The touch screen is nice but when I tap to turn a page the light almost *flashes"" as I have it on the dark mode with white lettering. It doesn't have any other color modes like the Nook does and I miss that. Not having a choice of color backgrounds is frustrating because I am so used to the Nook. There was an Amber color background on the Nook that was soothing to the eyes. The only choice I have with the Kindle is black and white. I was disappointed that I can't listen to music while I read, like I could with the Nook. Overall it's a good e-reader but doesn't offer may choices."
Donnajdee,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I rarely do reviews. My older paper white's battery went. Wouldn't hold a charge so while I sent it to have a new battery installed I thought I'd upgrade to this so I could use the audible. Whoa... didn't realize that meant only with blue tooth headphones until I got it. The page glares, the old one did not. This opens very slow, unlike my last one. This will be returned because it was a waste of money. I don't need audible that bad and if I do I'll go back to my Kindle Fire tablet where I don't need anything but to touch text to voice."
Priscilla Rippetoe,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have and love the previous generation 7 Kindle Paperwhite. The longer battery life and larger storage capacity enticed me to order the new version.

I was extremely disappointed with the new version as the display screen is not nearly as bright as my old one and it has an annoying yellow tint to it.

I was going to return it but my dad tried it and loved it. My dislike of this new version is probably because the display is so different from the generation 7 and my eyes are very sensitive.

I'm sure that if you are new to the Kindle Paperwhite you will love it just like my dad does. He would give it five stars."
Lady DG,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been thinking about this New waterproof Kindle for a few months, wanting to be able to read out in the yard or on our boat in the sunlight. I read and read and even left a question about how it connects to wifi. It says, and I was also told by others, that it connects to 2.4 ghz wifi and not the newest wifi, which AT&T just put in our house 5-6 weeks ago. I gave up--but I couldn't stop thinking about it and wondering when there would be an even newer model than the 10th generation 2018 version, so I could hook up. In desperation, I decided to go to Best Buy and talk to a real live person about this. The Amazon representative happened to be in the store, and she told me that even though my wifi connects at 4.7 there is normally an alternate wifi in the router and that it will connect. I believed her, bought it and just rerceived it on Tuesday....It worked immediately! It is fantastic! I love it. I have had absolutely no problems with anything. I was reading on my ipad, but it glares terrribly outside. Also, I have arthritis in my hands, and I had trouble holding it (weighing 1 lb.) This weighs 6. 4-6 ounces and it's perfect. There is no unevenness with the light, no problems with anything. I did have a problem connecting the power cord--it was extremely hard to push it in, but my husband tried and it finally snapped in. After that first try, I have been able to connect it with no problem! I love, love,love this new 10th generation, 2018, All-new Kindle Paperwhite. Downloads are quick and easy. I already had a Kindle Library because I was reading on my ipad. Call me one happy lady!!!!! Thank you, Amazon!"
Aaron G Cockrill,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Have owned this tablet for one week and I have charged it 3 times. It was about half way charged, charged it up to 100% started using it Monday around 4pm had to charge it up by Friday and again Monday morning. Other than the sucky battery everything else is good. When you are advertising and bragging about a device that can last weeks without charging and that is one of your selling points and it doesn't stand up as advertised that part needs to be corrected or removed."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to the base model, which I have, this is twice as good. Granted, that’s a given because of the nearly 2x resolution. The backlight is great, as is the new flush front—it’s comparable to reading on my iPad, which I generally do, due to it’s larger size. However, the size and the weight of this model are far better on the hands for extended reading. I am overly ecstatic that I can finally choose my own fonts to read with—I have been waiting for this option for years! Don’t get me wrong, I love Baskerville, Palatino, and particularly Caecilia, but the first two, without having an option to slightly bold them, makes the italics too thin, whilst with Caecilia, it’s lack of contrast makes it harder to read in longer texts—though I had no issue with that on my iPad. As far as people complaining about it jumping ahead, ignore that. This happens with any tablet; they just happen to be too touchy. So, in general, I’m very pleased with this model. Now, if only they had a color version? :)"
BostonMom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've wanted a Kindle for years, and I finally received one as a gift. I have to say that I absolutely LOVE it!

What I like the most is that it's compact and lightweight. In the past I have used the Kindle App on my iPad, but it's so heavy to hold for extended periods of time. I picked out a nice case that allows me to slip my fingers through a strap and it's so comfortable, my hand and/or wrist never get sore or tired from holding it.

I also appreciate the non-glare screeen (I am looking forward to reading on the beach in the summer), the long battery life and how easy it is to use. A great product, I couldn't be happier with it."
Mistycat,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had a kindle since generation 1! I moved to a Paperwhite 5 years ago and it's still working great.
Now I decided to gift myself with this new Paperwhite because of the bluetooth and waterproof added features and I'm glad I did. It's also thinner and faster than my old one and the battery lasts a lot longer.
Kindle Paperwhite makes reading so much easier for me. I can't read a real paper book anymore... I recently bought one and it was heavy to hold, the letters were so tiny to read and of course you need external light source too. With my Peperwhite I can be in the pitch dark of my room and read my book until I pass out. The light doesn't tire your eyes like from an iPad and you get to choose your comfortable font size. It's also way lighter than any book! It fits in any purse along with your phone. I highly recommend Kindle Paperwhite to anyone."
jason,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The good about the product is that it is easy on the eyes and the books look very nice. Also, there is the ability to change font. Also flipping through pages is simple.
The bad is that there is only partial screen rotation. Amazon placed the power button on the bottom where it can be accidently turned off while reading. Very brilliant! It could be easily corrected if the screen could be turned upside down and read like any smartphone or tablet on the planet probably. Because of screen rotation. This kindle only does landscape and vertical with button on the bottom. Only the 2 options. Its quite unbelievable that this feature was left out. Its a big let down and should be fixed. It is a very basic feature."
KKB3338,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not what I thought this.., expected more... coming from an iPad, I expected somewhat similar... But touch screen is super slow n flashes... the clarity isn’t so clear.., glad I got it during a sale because I definitely would not have paid full price!

Battery life seems to be long... weird that you can shut it off, it just goes to sleep.

I still don’t really know how it works so I have to play around with it...

I mainly bought it so I didn’t have to have bunch of books when I travel, but I do love the real thing, books. But got to save the trees! I hope this thing last a long time... because I do not want to buy another!"
Lone Star,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a fine e-book reader. But it pales in comparison to reading via the Kindle app on my iPhone and iPad.
Kindle Benefits:
It’s relatively inexpensive.
The battery lasts fairly long.
It’s a perfect size for reading and holding.
It’s really light weight.

Disadvantages:
It’s responsiveness is poor and clunky.
Page-turn functionality is touchy and undependable.
The off button is located in the worst possible place ... at the bottom, where you will accidentally turn it off constantly.

My recommendation is to download the free Kindle app from the Apple App Store, and simply read on your iPad or iPhone. The Apple devices allow for a more refined experience."
FROGsPower,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very happy with my new upgraded Kindle Paperwhite. It's lighter, waterproof, double storage & I absolutely love it! I use it everyday. I read everything on my Kindle. I have had carpal tunnel surgery on both wrists so holding books of various sizes is tiring and difficult. With my Kindle the weight and size is consistent and I can download books, magazines, even fan fiction and read to my heart's content. The battery power is long lasting and when needed it recharges quickly. I highly recommend the Kindle."
Pencepon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a Kindle user since the very first version, and I didn't think anything could be better than the Paperwhite — but this version is nicer in that I don't have to worry about accidental splashes under the various conditions in which I read (eating dinner, brushing my teeth...) However, and maybe this wouldn't be a problem for everyone, once I finish and close a book or document, all of my highlights and bookmarks are gone if I reopen that document. I am assuming this is a software issue and I hope it will be resolved soon, but this is a very big problem for me because I edit documents for other people and I need to be able to return to problem areas once I've finished reading. This ruins my workflow if I can't open a second document without losing everything from the first one. For this reason I deducted a star, but in every other way this Kindle Paperwhite is lovely!"
shapcomp,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to a Kindle Paperwhite because of a special offer that gave me money for the trade-in as well as a discount. . I love having a Kindle, but I am disappointed with the upgrade for a few reasons. First of all, my old case is too big. I didn't have to expect to buy a new one for the slight difference in size. Secondly, I miss having the night reading option. Finally, I find that highlighting a segment doesn't work as smoothly as the previous version. It often slides to the next page when I don't want it to do so, and it DOESN'T move to the next page when I want it to do so. So, if I knew what I know now, I would have kept my old one. The waterproof option is not one I really need, and I don't need more memory. I just need a Kindle that had the features on my old one!"
Jessy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a paperwhite (not sure what version) for 5 or 6 years. I have loved it since I read poolside every summer, and am outside with my son for his sports practices every spring and fall. The screen was the reason that I got a paperwhite to begin with. I have been in love with my paperwhite ever since. I have kept great care of it, but it does have a small scratch on the screen after 5-6 years of use. Finally decided to buy the new paperwhite this year on sale because as I stated before I love to read poolside! We put a pool in at our house this past summer and I am looking forward to reading while lounging in the pool and not just beside the pool. I have been using my new paperwhite for a month or so now and love it just as much as my last one. I read several reviews that talked about seeing bright spots, or light issues, I have not experienced either of these. It is just a little lighter than my last one, but not enough to make it noticeable, plus I keep mine in a case that has a reading kickstand to read hands free on lunch break, so the size difference is not noticeable at all to me. The main reason for me was just the waterproof feature that the new one has. All in all I am very happy with my new Kindle."
nyansky,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received a Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas 2013. I loved the ease of use, the words games you could download and it was easy to turn pages. After much use, it finally started slowing down to the point I put out the word I thought it was time for a new Kindle. Christmas 2018 did not disappoint, however the new Kindle did. I find it difficult to find books I want to read on the new one (never a problem on the old one), there are no word games to download and the most frustrating feature is that it is incredibly sensitive when turning pages and will skip ahead several pages. Then when I try to go back to where I was, I have the same problem in reverse. I have actually gone back to my old, slow Kindle. I will give the new one another try in the future and if my experience improves, I will update my review."
JCH Reader,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't notice any difference from my 6 year old K Paperwhite............old and new are great e-readers....do not upgrade if old is working for you.
J. Lester,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The main reason I bought this new kindle paper white was the promised WEEKS of battery life. I can’t say I can actually get 10 hours of battery life. So very disappointing. I am an avid reader, at times a book a day. I am also an avid camper. Hmmmmm. At times it is hard to find a place to charge my kindle each day. So I spent good money on an empty promise. I needed longer battery life, but could have kept my old one and had the same battery life.
Also at times I have to try to flip pages several times before I get any action. In my opinion this is a cheaply made device. It may be water resistance but I will most likely never need that. So no more false advertising, because someone else is coming to take over your market. And I hope it is soon. In the mean time live up to your hype."
Darla H.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my old paperwhite. But I’m clumsy so I upgraded to this one because it’s waterproof. It’s terribly glitchy. Takes over a minute to “wake up” so you can read where it was instantaneous before. I keep having to restart it because it freezes. The battery life sucks compared to my other one. Charge every week instead of every 3 weeks. She screen smears easily. And has a little bit of glare. Both issues I didn’t have with the older model. I’m very disappointed. I wish I had just kept my old one.

After my review I was contacted by tech support who helped me to get rid of most of the glitchiness. However the battery life and screen are still terrible and I still wish I had kept my old one."
Dmitry Portnoy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Waterproof Paperwhite is badly designed and made. It shares the clunky rubbery case with earlier Kindles, but at least the clunky rubber made those sturdy. Not so here: the plastic touchscreen is clamped by the thinnest pinch of overlapping material from the back, rather than a wider solid frame, making the assembly disturbingly squeezable. I normally replace my Kindles after two years. With this one after three months of use, the rubber has started to crack and even peel away. Things rattle inside when I lift it. And like my previous Kindles, neither the buttons nor the touch screen seem designed for this human’s fingers."
Jairo Valderrama,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Kindle that I've bought (first one was a Kindle Paperwhite 7th Generation - 2015 release) and in overall I'm really happy with this device.

* One personal concern that I had was the manual transfer from my previous one of all the personal documents that I have including position, highlights and notes but it was easy and I have all the data as expected. No jailbreak or anything.
* The design and size are really good. For those who ask if it's actually glare free, yes, all Kindle (not Fire) are glare free and are perfect for reading, they are design for this and they are improving.
* Talking about the battery, compared with the previous Kindle, it's dropping faster even with the same setup. I usually use it with Wi-Fi active and I avoid the build-in light, the Bluetooth is off and it's draining quicker. For sure it will last at least one week using it 1 hour and a half per day maybe one week and a half. I expected that the battery life was better but comparing against some other reviews that I read, in my case it's not so bad.
* One good feature is the integration with Audible but for now I prefer to use my phone to use this app and the reason is just the battery life perception that I have so far. If I decide to use it I will update the review with my thoughts about it.

In overall, for those who already have one Kindle without issues and are asking if an update is needed, my personal opinion is: not really but is always good to have a new Kindle. For those who don't have a Kindle and are thinking in buy one, don't think twice, for me, if you really enjoy, love to read and like to travel light, it is an invest."
Ann Dickey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my Kindle Paperwhite as my Driod reader fell into the bathtub. No fun!!
I was so very sad to loose my E-reader. But..... now that I have purchased and used the Kindle Paperwhite.... No more sad faces.
This reader is great!!! I love the light weight compact feel. The screen is VERY easy to read!! No glare!! No issues with reading in the sunshine. The built in light allows for reading in the dark, while my hubby sleeps
the touch screen is easy to use, and I can navigate from book-book, grab highlighted texts, and enjoy dictionary support soooooo easily. My Droid was not this user friendly AT ALL.
I am computer literate, but not an IT WIZ, this reader is intuitive, and I set it up all by myself. No sweat.
Having all my reading reading material at the touch of my fingertips WITH waterproof safeguard as I read in the tub...
WELL..... Im a very satisfied customer."
mel,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth kindle and I hate it. My last kindle died and needed to replace it so I went with the new waterproof version.

The first one I received the battery didn’t even last a day and there was a delay when. turning the page. So they sent a replacement and it is marginally better. But if you try to go back a few pages it brings you forward and then goes back and it is a process. There is a delay when opening a collection of books which is a feature i love but the new software sets it up differently. The battery barely last a week. The new face has a glare not as bad as and iPad but worse than it used to be.

This is a sub par product. It seems the price is high and they are skimping in quality. The software is terrible and definitely has not been an improvement in the least but worse than the older versions.

I feel I am at a crossroads with amazon since I love my last kindle and used take the kindle with me every where. This one just makes me more frustrated. I don’t know if I will buy another one."
William,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The faded text makes your reading experience annoying. At every turn, this device’s annoying operational characteristics discourage using it to read Kindle books. Amazon should thank their lucky stars, the Kindle reading software runs on phones, pads, and Windows computers. I discourage everyone from buying this device.

Just bought this in December and it has already failed. This is a terrible product."
Carrie,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my old kindle, and still prefer to use it over this new one for reading. I purchased this version, solely to use the text to speech function. Once you get it going, I think it works great. However, it has issues.
1. I'm now on my second one, due to the fact that my kindle decided to freeze and be lost forever with a giant battery logo stuck on the screen. Charging, plugging into a computer, and all of the other steps would not fix it. So, I'm on my second one. So, I'm not off to a great start, as it only lasted for a few months.
2. Both the returned and replacement unit have major connectivity issues. Unfortunately, I think my returned one worked slightly better, but not by much. Every time you turn it back on, it has problems finding the bluetooth device. I SO WISH there was a manual port to connect with a cord, but alas, there is not. You can go into settings and select the device and click connect, which works rarely for me. Unfortunately, I have to go in and turn bluetooth off, turn it back on, then go back to the device and connect, and THEN it works. Pretty much every time I use it. In doing so, you also turn off the text to speech function, so now you have to go back and turn that on again, as well. It's a major hassle, but I have a long commute, so I keep doing it (I need my books!).
3. Once you turn on text to speech, it's hard to get around. After much trial and error, I think I've figured out how to navigate. You have to press the place you want to be to select it first, and THEN double click. If you try double clicking without first pressing on what you want, it continually tries to say that you're selecting the Home button.
Also, it would be nice if you could adjust the settings for text to speech before you turn it on, but they are grayed out until the feature is selected, which makes it harder to navigate. I didn't realize that you could adjust the volume here at first, and almost bought a better speaker before I finally figured this out. You can also adjust the reading speed. I prefer to listen slightly slower than the default.
Side note, you should be able to turn text to speech on after you select your book by holding the power button until the pop up shows, and then lay two fingers on the screen. This works sometimes, but not all the time. When it doesn't work, you have to go to settings... accessibility... and then you can manually turn it on. Also, if you accidentally tap on the screen and it gets stuck on a word, you can swipe down and to the right to continue reading. My new one tells me this, the old one did not.... so sharing just in case it might help somebody (assuming that anybody read long enough to read my novel).
I hope they make a better version, but I'm not sure if they will. A tiny part of me wonders if this is all a ruse to push me towards Audible (which I also use, but it can get pricey with how many books I go through), but hopefully that's not the case. Time will tell."
ljbertrand09,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I broke my old Kindle Fire, I debated between a new Amazon tablet and the Kindle Paperwhite. Ultimately I did choose this device because I wanted primarily an e-reader, and that's what this is, nothing more or less. I think it functions a bit less well than my Kindle Fire did, and my Kindle Fire also had more capabilities, and the Amazon tablets actually offer less expensive options, but I purchased the Paperwhite because I wanted to be able to read in all kinds of light. I wonder if this summer I'll be pleased with my purchase or if I'll continue to wonder if I should have purchased the Amazon tablet instead . . ."
Michael Tompkins,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I picked up this Kindle Paperwhite last December, and I've used it nearly every day since. It makes reading easier in every way imaginable, and if you've never owned one I can't recommend it enough.

But what makes it so special?
- A massive library of ebooks to choose from that can be accessed not only from the Kindle but from any smart device. I've yet to come across a book I want that is not available. My only gripe with the Kindle store is that occasionally the ebook will be more expensive than the actual physical paperback, a price match feature would be nice.
- A built-in light that makes the page appear whiter by day, gives you the ability to read in total darkness and produces much less strain on your eyes. Not to mention you can read it in bright sunlight with no glare. In almost every way it's like looking at an actual book, plus the light has about 20 different levels so you really fine-tune it.
- The device is easy to hold with one hand and makes reading much more comfortable. If you read often for long periods of time you know the struggle of constantly readjusting yourself to reduce the strain of holding an actual book, especially if it's a really big book. This is not a problem whatsoever with the paperwhite.
- Text can be adjusted to any size that you prefer, and you have several different fonts to choose from as well. Any book you read can be adjusted to whatever specification you prefer to make the experience more enjoyable.
- You can define any word in an instant just by holding down on it, which is personally one of my favorite things, no more flipping through dictionaries. In addition to this, the X-Ray feature allows a similar function but with Characters and Locations from the book you're currently reading, which is deadly useful for series with a lot of Characters.

As you can see by the amount of praise I have for the Paperwhite, it's easily one of my favorite devices I've ever owned. My only real issue is a minor one, and that's that the battery life isn't as long as on previous Kindles. However that's understandable given the light, and also not nearly as big of a deal as people make it out to be since the previous Kindles went weeks without the need for a recharge. With this Kindle, you'll need to charge it pretty regularly if you read a lot, but the battery isn't so abysmal that you'll run out of charge on a flight or long drive. I tend to plug it in every other night before bed, which again is not that big of an inconvenience.

So yeah, if you're a reader, or interested in Ebooks, there's never been a better time to own a Kindle. I think the Paperwhite is the best for most people when it comes to price vs performance, but any of the other models are sure to offer you a great ereading experience. Amazon really knocks it out of the park with these."
safetyfirst,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not having any issues other people stated they are having. I have eye problems and can only read comfortably with an E-reader. What they state for a battery life is misleading. Maybe it will hold a charge for 2 weeks if you do not turn your Kindle on. I use mine 4 to 6 hours a day, sometimes more. Therefore I have to charge it every 3 days. Not a big deal to me. I have not tried the audio books on this yet. That would use more battery also. I think you will find this works ok for you."
Robin P.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Although this is, IMHO, a good kindle reader for your kindle books, it suffers a bit with the Audible and Whispersync integration. The basic problem is the necessary bluetooth connection. No problem with a bluetooth connection, per se, but if you are on a flight and want to relax to an Audible audio book, you basically need to turn off airplane mode to access your audio and whispersync books. If Amazon manages to make the USB interface capable of driving those dongles you use to attach to get a 3.5 mm jack then that is fine. I don't want to spend the money on a dongle and find that it doesn't work. Other than that, this works fine. The cover glass is a bit less matte in appearance but I do really appreciate the water resistance. These issues are why, at this time, I would only give it 3 stars."
Elizabeth Panska,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using a Kindle Fire for several years and when looking around to upgrade / replace it, I thought the Paperwhite sounded like a perfect fit. I only use my Fire for eBooks and I liked the promise of water resistance, longer battery life and additional storage. When I got my new device, I was sincerely disappointed. The experience reading a book is great. The text is crisp and clean and you can move from one page to the next easily. Unfortunately, getting to the book is somewhat painful. Opening the home screen, taking any kind of action or viewing menu items is painfully slow. The screen also flashes several times as if it’s struggling to render. I had similar behavior while navigating to the menu from within the book or bookmarking a page. I haven’t seen this reported in other reviews so maybe my expectations are too high after reading with a Fire, but after two devices exhibiting the same behavior I have to assume it’s working the way it’s supposed to.

Overall, it felt like I was using a decades old device rather than the newest Kindle. The experience was so bad that I thought it had to be malfunctioning and asked technical support to send me a replacement. The second device was just as bad. It is frustrating as I think the device has significant potential, but I will be returning to another Fire for the time being.

On a related note, Amazon service has been great throughout."
Monica Leone,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my second Kindle Paperwhite. I had my first for many years til it decided to do a backflip from counter level. ;( I read every night before going to sleep with the adjustable backlighting that doesn't disturb others in the room. Thank goodness for Prime shipping I wasn't without it for long! SO excited to have the waterproof one now so I can read anywhere! The price is crazy reasonable. Seriously love the Paperwhite!
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The main reason I purchased this Kindle was because it said the battery would last for “weeks, not hours.” I thought this would be great, I can take it on vacation for a week and not have to charge it. WRONG. If you spend hours reading on a rainy weekend, you’re going to use up the whole charge. The battery lasts no longer than the battery on my iPad. And to be honest, I much prefer a reading on the Kindle app on my iPad than reading on the paperwhite. It is MUCH easier to manage and find my books and samples on the iPad app. The Kindle is smaller and more lightweight, but that’s about it. Also, it doesn’t always sync with the book on my iPad which is annoying. It seems to be hit or miss on that."
BobP,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had several Kindles over the years and enjoyed them all. I received this latest Kindle as a gift and while it’s better than my previous versions in most respects, it does have one glaring problem.

Why on earth would they locate the power button on the bottom edge? The button is located right where your fingers support the reader in your hands or where you rest it while reading in bed. I’ve accidentally hit the power button many times while reading and it really disrupts the flow of reading when it puts the Kindle to sleep. This is such an obviously bad place to locate the power button, was this not obvious when testing? Locating the power button on top would have made so much more sense. For a 10th generation device someone really dropped the ball by locating the power button where it’s so easily accidentally pressed. Really makes no sense how this could make it out the door with such an obvious shortcoming."
Wicked Felina,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the ""bundle"" and am returning it. While the Paperwhite 10th version has a bit higher resolution (which is only evident to me in the screensavers), it bugs me that the surface without the bezel is all smooth, without the slight toothiness of my 2nd generation Paperwhite. This new surface is a fingerprint collector--might as well just use the Kindle app on my phone. I'm keeping the old one and its better cover.

At a glance, the ""leather"" cover for this one appears to be the same quality as the old one, but it is not. This one has a distinctly cheap feel that I do not experience with the old cover. Just a plasticky feel. Also, you can fold the cover to the back, but it doesn't lie flat against the back of the Kindle as the old one did."
Helania Hunt,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s okay. I don’t necessarily think it’s worth the full price you pay, so I’d try to get one on a big sale. I got mine because I’m a very avid reader, and I was tired of reading on my phone. I was also about to go on a 16 hour road trip in a few weeks so I needed something to read on other than my phone. I like this much better than reading on a phone or tablet because it’s less straining on my eyes. It’s also not as bright in complete darkness so you don’t disturb others around you if they’re trying to sleep. I also really like the fact that this version comes with audible and can be paired with Bluetooth headphones. HOWEVER — and this is a pretty big deal to me — the charge for this device does not last “weeks” as they claim. Especially not if you read a lot. It might last one week, maybe a week and a half if you’re not using it. I also find it really annoying that the button on the bottom can be pushed so easily. I don’t yet have a case on mine, so when I put it in my book bag any sort of shift or movement can apply pressure to the button and cause the screen to come on. Soooooo, I guess I have to get a case. But other than that it’s a pretty good product. It definitely serves its purpose but I really wish the battery life were better."
NewYorkCityGirl2014,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this a few days ago, so I cannot be accurate about battery life etc. but can share my experience with setting up the device. Set up was easy and all books from my other Kindle automatically transferred to my new Kindle. I had two probelms with setup: the cable needed to set up the device did not fit (too big and no plug for charging included) and the keyboard was so sensitive? that I had to type my user name and password more than twelve times until I had no errors. I used my old cable to connect to WiFi and will have to use it to charge the device. Disappointing that Amazon can't take care of this properly."
Carol W,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've had my beloved original paper white since they first released & it was still working fine - but I dropped my cell phone & it hit the reader screen which caused a bright spot on the screen which was very distracting. So when the deal came up for 6 months of unlimited & 25% off on trade in - I grabbed the new 2018 model. I LOVE this one even more. The brightness has a better range & the back lighting is more evenly distributed. Merry Christmas to me. :)
John Campbell,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife was fond of her earlier Paperwhite model but it got lost so we bought this one. I suppose waterproof and bigger battery is nice though no practical difference for her. But they changed around much of how to do things, and they put ads and specials on it. The help page at Amazon purportedly has instructions to get rid of them but they don't work--there is no edit button there. It is maddening. If her old one turned up she would give this new one to somebody."
S. Stone,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My oldest kindle was a keyboard type, 2018 kindle paper white is the 5th kindle that I own and is the most disappointing one! 1st of all I had trouble to set it up because any touch didn’t work and still need several try to delete or download or any other kind of functions , it didn’t opened up this morning after only owning it for a week! I had a kindle paper white 7th generation still function perfectly but without Bluetooth. If you’re looking for a kindle please don’t fool by so called “Newest”, new doesn’t mean better!"
Fondue Mom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After having my Paperwhite 3 stolen while on vacation, I came back home to order a new one. Based on the negative reviews, I was very nervous about ordering the newest version, and I considered purchasing the older version off of Ebay. I am so glad I took the risk. . . I've found all the complaints to be for naught. I really like the smoothness of the surface over the raised bezel. The upgrades are thoughtful, and the quality is the same as previous versions. In particular, I like the ""low vision"" mode. I have typical aging eyesight (middle age fifties), and the ""low vision"" mode that bolds the font makes the reading easy on the eyes. Very happy with my purchase, and I'm glad I took a chance on the newest version!"
Photo Belle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I know I will love the product for reading books, just as I have my first kindle and my first paperwhite both of which allowed me to play a couple of word games in odd moments. Those games were handy for when I did not have time to devote to reading a book (i.e. waiting in the doctor's office, or for a meeting to begin). I know that I will really miss those games. When I am home I can always pick up the older kindle and work them, but I can't take them with me. By the way, I also work picture puzzles on my kindle fire. They would not be appropriate for the paperwhite."
de,4.0 out of 5 stars,"i been researching these on ""youtube."" to decide if i really needed a kindle paperwhite. so, i did it , traded my old keyboard 1 plus got 20% off. so i think i got a good deal. ( they are a bit pricey when not on sale.) i'm not real sure if i need it tho. i have a new 8"" kindle fire, which i thought was a bit heavy to read on. so , i am trying the paper white. i seem to need the light on 70% all the time which i""m not sure i like or why. it seems responsive, but i hate seeing the book cover in pale black and white screen, and its kinda small on the screen. and i""m still not sure yet about a few things."
S. tamburin,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like this because I read Italian books and it translates anything I do not understand. I am just at the intermediate level so I need help. The best thing about it is I can put a lot of books in here so I don't have to have more shelves for my books. I also love that I can read in the dark and I love that I can read in the bathtub. I am careful not to get it wet but it is supposed to be waterproof so if a few drops gets on it I hope that is true. The worst thing about this was the first one didn't work right but Amazon did replace it. The second worse was it was hard for me to learn to do the things I needed to do to use the translation part. Going back and forth on the computer for various instructions and just finding what I wanted to know was no fun.
Peggy C. Rau,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very confusing e reader.....I am still trying to learn my way around it. Customer Service has been helpful but I can't give you an honest rating at this date. I do like the idea of being able to read in the dark!!! That I would give 5 STARS....but overall I am still not sure if I will keep or if I will go back to my Dinosaur Kindle.

102119 Continuation of my review: I find I can't return the e-reader paperwhite which is a darn shame......so I will put it in the recycle bin at home and go back to my Dinosaur Kindle which was worn out the race by-far more superior than the new one with all the bells and buttons. I prefer my Dinosaur!!!!! Ducky"
Droid2point0,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm sure the product works fine. I bought this as a gift for my grandson following his graduation from basic training in the Navy, and he says he is enjoying it. But somehow in the registration process - which was NOT very user friendly - the device was registered to MY Amazon account. We still haven't figured out how to resolve this, as he doesn't exactly have time between advanced training classes to spend time on the phone with Amazon."
gtm,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Other than adding Bluetooth capability, it is not as good as the previous model. It is slower to wake up and does not get as bright. Screen has a slight yellow tint to it. The$60 Amazon premium leather case is nice and fits well, but not worth the price."
therealbigsky,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle the home screen is my library. My new Kindle the home screen is an advertisement screen for Amazon. This is on a Kindle ""without special offers"". If I were to keep this stinky piece of Amazon nonsense, I would have to fight through advertisements just to read a book. Have they lost their minds? Soon there will be ads for Viagra and sanitary napkins on there. I'm sending it back."
Chuck White,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite expecting to have another reading device that would be easy to carry and use where ever I went. What I received was a device that bombards me with unwanted adds while I am reading, is hard to control, has an ill though out set of system options, gets cranky when the battery runs, doesn't turn off and doesn't have any instructions.
PLEASE, do not waste your money. Buy an Ipad or Android tablet, download the kindle app and use it.
CHARLES R WHITE"
K. Webber,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this mainly because I like to read while floating in the pool. The fact that it's waterproof in case I happen to drop it makes me less concerned and I enjoy my time to read more. The light is perfect for bright, sunny days whereas with it was somewhat of a struggle with my previous Kindle Paperwhite. The capacity for larger and bolder fonts is great for outside and you can choose smaller fonts and less light when reading in bed. The letters are sharp and clean and easy to see. There's a learning curve if you had a previous Paperwhite but it didn't take too long to get the new one set up. Worth the money so far which is only about three weeks in."
DP,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm disappointed with some of the changes from my Kindle series 2.
1. This new and updated Kindle does not keep the page instructions intact, like time left in chapter or page number, for the next time it is opened.
2. The light turns on very bright for 3-5 seconds when opened before dimming to a preset level which is disruptive to your circadian rhythm when reading during the night.
3. The clock does not have the option of 12 hour vs 24 hour time.
As an update, I received my first Kindle Paperwhite about 5 years ago and used it happily until I dropped it and part of the screen was gray. Then I purchased the ""Kindle Paperwhite – Now Waterproof with 2x the Storage"" (the blue cover) in May 2019 which disrupted my sleep if I read during the night.
I decided to try the ""Previous Generation - 8th"" (the pink cover) which came back in stock.
As you can see from the photo, the light from the blue cover is very white compared with the older generation with the pink cover. The pink cover is similar to the night setting on the iPad, whereas the blue cover is more like the normal day setting.
That explains why I could not fall asleep after reading on the blue cover.
Both kindles are very easy to use, but if you anticipate using your device to read during the night, you may want to opt for a previous generation model."
Yazmin,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m going to be real. I had never had a kindle before, I actually had a Nook and this was years ago.

BUT LET ME TELL YOU THAT FIRST MODEL NOOK I HAD WAS 100000x better.

I read the reviews and I see people bringing up the battery life and the glare and that is honestly THE LEAST of your worries.

I’m not sure if all the other kindles are as S L O W as this one but if they are and you guys are giving it over two stars then what is wrong with you. If anyone is willing to wait FOR-FREAKING-EVER for a single thing to load then those people all monsters.

I could look past battery life (seriously charge it or get a portal charger it’s not that big of a deal) or are complaining about the glare? Buy an anti-glare screen or a screen protector that helps with smudges. Don’t use the dang thing in places where you know the lighting isn’t good.

Those things are FIXABLE but the amount of time it takes for it to load is freaking ridiculous and not fixable!!! I know it’s not like I'm watching videos or playing games but if I want to give something five stars on good reads and I click five stars and then it takes over a minute to add the five stars then we are going to have a problem. I want to finish a page and move onto the next in less than a second not wait for over a minute in anticipation.

And I tried to get over it and to just be cool with it but it is the most damn infuriating thing EVER! It’s like being on the oldest computer ever and having the crappiest WiFi connection ever. It’s like using an iPhone that has two system updates that are needed. It’s like when the Netflix movie is loading and it’s been on 25% for over an hour.

If you aren’t a monster then don’t get it. Don’t waste your time. Don’t try to convince yourself you can deal with it. It’s not worth trying, it’s not worth waiting for, it’s not worth having to print return labels, and it’s not worth driving to the amazon store to drop it off.

I hope this review saves someone from going through the frustration and disappointment and regret that I had to go through. Use your phone or buy a Nook."
Onemorepage,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used a Nook Glowlight for quite a few years. Bought my Paperwhite because attracted to the waterproof feature. I'm never going back to Nook!

--Simple interconnectivity with my local library for borrowing.
--Clear display under any lighting conditions
--Comfortable to read across an extended period.
--Sit in the hot tub and read without fear of dropping it in!

Downsides--

--dark flash every few pages. It has taken me awhile to get used to this.
--screen taps sometimes produce unexpected results.

Overall, happy with my Paperwhite!"
S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"What was wrong with the old glare-free screen? The newer version: unimpressed by the glare as depicted in previous reviews. You had it right with the old one. Not sure I will keep.
More disappointment with the miniscule battery capacity. I have to charge it daily. My old kindle charge lasted for weeks.
Update Mother's Day.
Well i was told to return this, and did so, to have it repaired They were unable to repair it and i was to receive a new one today. This morning i wake up to find an email from Amazon stating my Kindle won't be coming because it was damaged during shipment and will receive a refund instead. If i reorder it costs more than what i originally paid. Disatisfied customer. I recommend waiting till they work out the glitches and fix the screen glare."
Jonah Willis,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I must have gotten one of the ""Working"" units. Haven't run into any weird light bleeding, charging cables that don't fit, or any other issues. As per usual when you get a ""working"" unit it just works. From the easy product wrapping which I truly appreciate. (Amazon creates less waste for themselves and the consumer) The new flush display is something I have always wanted for the Kindle. No more dust in the corners that will never seem to go away! The only thing about the design that I don't like is the power button placement. It really is the most inconvenient place. I, like many, put my pinky there to support the bottom of the Kindle. Turns off all the time! If that were to move to the top it would be perfect! I would recommend this happily to friends. Just be aware of your pinky..."
Stubtoe,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had 3 kindles and I couldn't survive without them. I love them and I resisted them for a long time. That said, my previous paperwhite was better than the new one. I have a cover that ""wakes"" it up when opened. The previous one started right up. the new one takes a few seconds - not a big deal, just irritating.
The real problem is that in the short time I've had it, there have been 2 times where it opened to a white screen - no idea why. And one time where it just wouldn't start. Thankfully, I still have my old one as a backup. So did I just get a lemon or are they not being made at the same quality as before. Who knows."
Carol G.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle , but I was disappointed to see that it did not have the cell connectivity . I read the features and my decision to purchase it was dependent on the fact that, on the comparison link, said it had wifi or wifi/cell. Since all my 3 or four fires have only wifi connections I wanted another kindle with the cell connection to take over for my old 3G version!"
dogmom,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like my Kindle overall but the automatic download of books is driving me crazy. I have tried to set my preferences to stop that, but it continues. I order a lot of books through Book Bub and I don't want to have to page through so many pages of books to find the one I want to read. Every time I turn my airplane mode off, I have to spend quite awhile removing all the books that have downloading. I have searched everywhere and have not been able to figure out how to prevent this. I also don't like the on button at the bottom. I am constantly hinting it by mistake. It would be much better if it was on the top."
Chrys Barnes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first e-reader and I like it a lot. It is easy enough on my eyes to read at night. Brought it on vacation to read on the plane and in airports. It is compatible with Amazon's Audible program, which I subscribe to, but haven't used on the Kindle because you have to use blue tooth headphones or other blue tooth device, which I do not have. No jack for plugging in old fashioned ear buds. That's ok. I have the audio books on a different device."
Linda McCabe,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really do not like this Kindle but they no longer make my old model. I do not like the size, the touch screen on anything for me is a problem because I do not have complete fingerprints which help with swiping, ie turning the page. My old kindle had a button on the side to turn pages, the battery lasted much, much longer, and the screen, as well as the unit itself, was bigger but small enough for me to hold in one hand and still use the button to turn pages if I wanted. I was able to read more on each page. So now I am in the hunt to see if I can find a used Old model. Waste of money for me and many of my friends feel the same!"
David Ross,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this device. It's easy on the eyes and encourages me to read. Light weight, thin, and holds a charge for what seems like forever. It's not entirely intuitive on how to get to the menu and such and it doesn't come with instructions. My wife had to show me how to leave my book and go to the menu. check out youtube, there's probably helpful videos for you. I really recommend this e-reader"
S.L.K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I finally joined the 21 century and purchased this Kindle. I love it. It is light weight to hold making it easy to read in bed with out hand fatigue. I can also put it in my purse or briefcase making super convenient to read in-between clients and appointments. I haven't tested the waterproof feature yet but find it comforting to know it is. I would recommend this Kindle and would purchase it as a gift for friends or family. I do wish it was in color for reading my anatomy manuals but I do have my phone for that feature. So glad I made this purchase I can even read in the dark the matte screen and the backlight feature makes reading in any lighting situation easy and comfortable.
Dr. Trish,4.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE this Kindle! I started with a Gen 1 and have been waiting for a waterproof Kindle so I can read in the tub or the pool or on a boat. I was delighted to see that this came out before I went on vacation. It was perfect even in the bright sun and in the water. The only con I have is that it needs to be easier to find the answer to questions and the operator manual should be easily accessible from the home screen. That’s the reason for four stars instead of five. It’s a little heavier but smaller so it fits in a purse. I purchased to waterproof cover along with it and both performed very well. Highly recommend!
Clinton Wasylishen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an old kindle with the 3G and the keyboard (not paperwhite, not lit) and this is an upgrade and a downgrade at the same time. I am not sure but I feel that the screen is smaller, which is good in that the entire thing is a lot more portable.

I obviously have not tested the waterproof part of the claim, but I trust that it is, and I like that it isn't something that I need to worry about getting a bit of rain on. I take it often to the beach with me, and sometimes to the pool.

The interface is a bit laggy, which others have noted, but overall it is usable. At this point I recommend the Kindle Paperwhite :)"
R. Lau,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice upgrade from my 6th Gen. PaperWhite. The 300 ppi text is more relaxing on my eyes. I was disappointed that one cannot read along with the audible book -- should have read the prior reviews more carefully. The old ""Kindle Keyboard"" had that feature and more: one could upload mp3 files so you could have music, audio books from other sources. It could also ""read"" text as it was to speak each word. Why then was that capability eliminated from the more “advanced” models."" I regret having lost my Kindle Keyboard during travel.
However, this was a great value based on the trade in program for my Kindle, 6th Generation: $25 gift card; 25% discount on a new Kindle; use of my Prime rebate. I was able to upgrade for less than $30."
Mark,4.0 out of 5 stars,Like the 2018 Paperwhite better than my previous 2015 Paperwhite. However the page turn sensitivity on the 2018 Paperwhite causes unintentional page turns when compared to the previous 2015 Paperwhite. There may be some improvement in the battery life but that is not absolutely quantifiable to me. Increased storage a plus but I did not have an issue with that on my previous 2015 Paperwhite.
R Haley,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to admit I was drooling over the paperwhite since before Christmas. I love to read on the Kindle screen and my Kindle is... old. I have also been using my fire tablet for reading and one of the features that I really enjoy is listening to audible and reading at the same time. With a loud and busy house, this immersive reading technique is ideal. I guess I assumed that at the very least, this feature would be available on the new paperwhite!!! Unfortunately, I was wrong. I have been hanging on to this e-reader for a week, hoping that there is something I am missing. I also reached out to Amazon customer service to find out if it was user error. The response I received was audible this and whispersinc that, everything I already know. I'm not even sure if they read my question. It boils down to ""Can I listen to Audible and Read at THE SAME TIME?"" I guess the answer is no. With a heavy heart, I have decided to return the paperwhite and hope that Amazon adds this feature in next-gen Kindles."
cylmw,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Now that I've had this new Kindle for a couple of weeks, a few added features carry an irritating intrusion to reading enjoyment. PASS ON PROMOTING. When I turn on my kindle, I want to read my reading selections. I do not want to read promotions. I get that in my email and Amazon.com. These irritating intro promotions occupy memory space---do not ""accidentally select"" the offering. HUGE NEGATIVE: ""On/Off"" button along the Kindle BOTTOM EDGE next to the CHARGING INSERT. How many 10th Kindle purchasers ""accidentally"" interrupted the best story action because they accidentally bumped the On/Off button. I'm very sorry I traded in my old Kindle. Got the new because of increased memory and storage since I enjoy reading a couple of books at a time. Bah---New Kindle not worth the thoughtless designs and usage of increased memory to ""intro advertised purchasing!!"
Eric V,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A solid ereader. Buttons would be nice but spending another $130 on an oasis for buttons seems silly since the paper white is now waterproof too and has the same resolution. The lighting is great, I love that the screen is flush with the bezel now. Audible isn’t a factor for me as I play audio books in my car through my phone and have an echo speaker. It’s a nice perk for those who don’t have those options though. The back is rubberized so it’s easy to grip without a cover. All in all, it’s great. Well done amazon."
J. Rowdy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read almost everyday and usually outside or in the sunroom. You can not read the fire kindle screen outside. This paperwhite is thinner and lighter than the previous versions. They last 3 or four years, then just won't login or reset. Still better than carrying around hundreds of books. But the way, I still buy books.
This time I ordered cute covers. Before there were just the Amazon leather covers. Kindles are usually tough and dropping it does not break the glass. Why isn't Amazon making phones like the kindle. Or maybe the real question is, Why aren't Apple and Samsung using the Amazon gorilla glass."
Anahi Vasquez,4.0 out of 5 stars,Only problem I have is that I wish we could listen to the audiobook and read the ebook at the same time. English is my second language and when I’m reading some older books or books that are above my reading level I really like listening to and reading the book at the same time. Maybe in the future this will be an option? I hope so.
Marie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am sorry to say,that I made a terrible mistake and ordering this product so quickly. I thought my older Kindle was almost dead. Only to find out that I had accidently left the wi-fi on and running which kills the battery quickly. My original Kindle is now fine again and I do love this one. The paper white will have to wait until needed. I will also have to get a case for it, got used to one with my other. Sorry I sound so dumb about my Kindle but at least now I do have a back-up. Once I have to use the new one I will be sure to give a better review, as I am sure it will be fine, just need to get used to it."
Douglas W. Diehl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this primarily for traveling. I sometimes take long trips and like to have plenty of good reading material with me. Kindle meets that objective without cluttering my luggage with physical books. I prefer having a book in my hand, however, but you can't beat the Kindle for convenience. I like to read bestsellers, and the price for e-books in this category is almost the same as what I pay for a physical book. This has disappointed me. There are, however, times when books come on sale on Amazon (and sometimes are offered free), and I try to avail myself of these bargains.

The Kindle Paperwhite is small, light and competent."
Beverly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle is fine, but beware of this:: When you order your Kindle you get ""kindleunlimited"". The wording is : ""...""read what you want when you want it...."". I presumed that for three months I could download from Amazon the books I wanted to read and after three months I would be charged a monthly fee. WRONG. Under ""Start Reading"" the fine print says unlimited from a specific set of books. No way would you read this fine print, especially when you get the kindleunlimited email prior to even receiving your Kindle in the mail. Personally I am very disappointed in Amazon for not making kindleunlimited more clear when advertising ""Start unlimited reading....read what you want..."". This is the first time in many, many years that Amazon has disappointed me, so don't fall into the same trap I did."
James P. White,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Back in the box after 5 minutes. I’ve gotten tomagotchis out of a gumball machine that make this look bad. No idea why this is a thing, it’s slow, tiny, grey and did I mention slow & tiny? Don’t."
D.R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was reluctant to jump on the new Paperwhite due to other reviewers saying the battery life is poor but when the screen cracked on my 5-year-old Paperwhite, I decided to take the chance. I have not noticed any battery issues at all! Even with the wifi on and the lux turned to 8, I can read for a couple of hours every night for many, many days, just like I could with my previous model. Although new waterproof and Audible capabilities aren't a big deal to me, I do appreciate the ppi increase and the light on the screen seems more evenly distributed. And it is a bit lighter. Trading in a couple of old Kindles and getting an additional trade-in discount on top of a $99 sale price brought my out-of-pocket cost down pretty significantly. So I'm a happy reader!"
Jack,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle is nice to read on and I found it easier to use and better quality than the Nook I had. But the Kindle books on Amazon cost as much as real books, so unless you really want to read on the Kindle you might as well save the money you would spend on the Kindle, and just get real books. Save even more by going to the library for real books. But if you want to read on the Kindle, most libraries will let you borrow and download books to your Kindle for a couple weeks free. Also note that very few good books are offered on Kindle Unlimited, and it is very difficult to search for these. It seems like they want you to give up and buy books that are not on Kindle Unlimited. So Kindle Unlimited is definitely not worth the monthly fee. They should call it Kindle Very Limited!"
Kunukia,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought myself a Paperwhite tenth generation in December of 2018. The first one sent me would not hold a charge, so they immediately sent me another, very good service there. Now, just over a year later, the new one also loses charge. it was at 100% 4 hours ago. I have not used it at all, and it is at 87%. This is annoying, I would expect more than 12 or 13 month old device to hold up better than that.
Luckily, I just bought myself an new regular kindle, because I so hate when I am left without one! Not sure if I can get this fixed or what I should do. I haven't gotten what I consider my moneys worth..."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is everything it claims to be. Light, durable, easy to read, easy to navigate, long battery life.

I love this thing! It is very easy to ready. Good lighting for easy reading. I have bad eyesight (i.e., not correctable to 20/20). Print usually gets blurry after reading hardcopy books for a couple of hours. However, due to the lighting and the customizable font type and size, I can read this endlessly without the print getting blurry. Touch to turn pages; swipe right to go back a page... so simple and allows for one-handed reading (e.g., wine glass in one hand, kindle in the other).

I couldn't be happier with it. Honestly, I can't imagine why anybody would complain about it. This is my first Kindle, so I do not have anything to compare it to. My wife is on her second one. She just loves it... so much so she thought I needed one. (She was right!)

My wife has a case, but I prefer not having a case, because it literally fits in my jeans pocket, so I can take it everywhere. It's durable and feels durable. I would never carry my iPhone around without a case; however, I do not have any concerns about carrying this around without a case.

I'm a pretty critical person, and I can usually find drawbacks to just about everything I buy. However, I don't have anything even remotely negative to report about my kindle. Best birthday present in years!

... wait, I do have one negative: Although many college textbooks are available for the Kindle app, they are not viewable on the Kindle eReader. As a professor, it'd be really useful to be able to view textbooks on the eReader itself."
WILLIAM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Media access has allowed me to develop bad habits. Habits of easily being distracted and wasting time. Iphone operating system revealed through SCREEN TIME how distracted I've become. My NEW PaperWhite has help me get back on track ... more READING and less wasted time with APPS and WEB surfing.

First day frustration was the lack of SPEED my PaperWhite has compared to my smartphone ... and it took time to realign my self back to READING and not using unlimited APPS.

Will I get rid of my smartphone? NO.

When I pick up my Paperwhite I am focused, productive and using my time more wisely. I have acquired nearly 1,000 Kindle Books and Audio Books through the years. And with lightweight, long battery life and easy on the eyes Paperwhite ... I am now enjoying the Kindle library I already own.

I highly recommend the Paperwhite for those who want to become more productive and less distracted."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Got my new Kindle Paperwhite today. I must say it is much smaller than I expected. It was easy to set up and connect to the wireless. Then I went to plug in the charging cable and it doesn't go in all the way. Pushed as hard as I felt comfortable as I did not want to break it right out of the box. No go. All my other USB charging cables plug in just fine, just not the one supplied with the Paperwhite. This is not acceptable. You will need to buy another cable if you do not already have one. Total FAIL on Amazon's part."
Trey,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I currently own two Kindles - A Kindle Fire and the current Kindle Paperwhite. The screen on the Paperwhite is amazing. It adjusts perfectly when going from low to high levels of light. There is no glare whatsoever and the clarity in the text is glorious. I have not used any previous models of the Paperwhite, so I cannot comment on the differences in brightness. However, I can confirm that the back light is fairly bright when reading in bed. I normally keep mine at the lowest setting and it is still fairly bright.

My biggest issues with the Paperwhite is the fluidity, speed, and reaction of the touch screen. The page turns are not fluid at all. Its almost like a glitch or stutter between pages . Furthermore, it takes multiple taps or swipes to get the page to even turn. This sort of takes away from the enjoyment of reading. Sometimes it will even freeze and then skip multiple pages. The Kindle Paperwhite is also very slow when ""waking up"" from being in a sleep state. Very slow all around actually. Downloads are slow. Opening books is slow. So on and so on. After purchasing this item, you will quickly start to realize that the only thing really good about it is the screen, but everything else is less than satisfactory or just plain awful.

For the price that Amazon is selling this, I would not recommend purchasing this model. I purchased mine at a discount on Prime Day and I still don't really think it was worth the money."
Steve,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this new kindle. After reading all the reviews, I decided to switch out my old kindle touch. The back lighting is great and makes reading easier, day or evening. Just be careful to adjust your settings so the screen is not too bright. Also, keep your internet connection turned off when not using it. That really drains the battery fast. But, with that off, I get at least a week worth of reading on one charge, and I read a lot."
Dena,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm happy with my new Paperwhite. But not thrilled. It is more difficult to use than the older kindle because they have since added more manipulative junk. It only has military time and can't be set to 12H. Goodreads is forced on me. I don't find the text any sharper in the new one. Audible is nice and the Paperwhite is easier to read in low light. It's a decent product, but I expected more."
Night Owls Book Obsessions,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven’t even had this Paperwhite for a day yet and I already know I’m going to love it. When I put this beauty next to my 2015 Paperwhite, it was kind of sad. This one is very similar to my Oasis and actually downloads books faster than that does. The screen is crisp and beautiful and I love how light it is."
Steve M,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought two of the 32-Gb model.

Pros:
Very quick response to page turns.
View in any light. Seriously.
Thin! And very lightweight
Audiobooks play well over Bluetooth buds
32 Gb is plenty to store all my kindle
books (but see below for audiobooks)

Cons:
Battery life is only approximately 1 week
Don’t store too many audiobooks! They
eat up 32 Gb VERY quickly
Still evaluating the ads that appear:
maybe it’s worth the $20 to make
them disappear!"
Kelly L. Stark,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle was a gift, and it brings me to 3 now. Two are different Oasis models.

I like the simplicity of the Paperwhite. It’s sleek and no-nonsense. The screen is excellent for text; I have an iPad Pro and an iPhone with the Kindle app buy I invariably reach for the Kindle for reading books.

The touchscreen on the Paperwhite is responsive. That said, I had grown used to the hardware buttons on the Oasis models and I liked them.

Ultimately, the biggest sales features of the Paperwhite for me are the price and the size. It feels better in my hand than either of the Oasis models did."
MrsMommyLoves5,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is absolutely the most annoying Kindle I’ve ever owned. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong to cause it to be so complicated. I don’t even enjoy reading with it anymore.
I accidentally turn the pages with then slightest movement. Then I turn off something and it won’t change the page at all- unless I restart the kindle. I wish I had stuck with my previous Kindle Paperwhite... I didn’t mind the “lip” on the screen. I just enjoyed the thought of a waterproof case. However, come to think of it- why on earth would I need it to be waterproof. With being a full-time SAHM, when would I remotely have the chance to even submerse it just to find out?
I want my other one back. Yesterday."
Sandy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This newest addition Kindle Paperwhite was a Christmas gift from my kids this past year and I absolutely love it! It beats using my phone or my tablet for reading, mainly due to its size and multi-functions. I can adjust the light and the text to suit my individual needs for easy reading, and flipping through the pages quickly and efficiently is achieved without any hesitation whatsoever. Because of the size and awesome features, I can also take the kindle with me wherever I go for use indoors or out which is very convenient, as well, not to mention the fact that it is also waterproof which is a plus.
I am very happy with my gift. Kudos to the seller for offering a fine product, great service and prompt delivery!"
Vanessa Boren,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first real experience with any type of electronic reader. I had purchased an online book a few years ago but it was honestly a total pain trying to keep my place on a laptop. I'm really enjoying using the Kindle. I do wish the scrolling feature was a little smoother, as right now it kind of flashes and goes to the next screen or portion of the screen. But other than that I'm really enjoying it. I love that I can create a second reading list for my ten-year-old. Now I just need to get a case for it. I would definitely recommend having a case."
Hokie,3.0 out of 5 stars,"When it first arrived, it was temperamental to get connected to my local WiFi, kept dropping the connection, refusing to see the network (the modem was 10' away), etc. After a day of persistence it seems to have worked itself out. With the intermittent connection, downloads were difficult/impossible. I still don't understand after all these years why we can't get a good browser and are still using an ""Experimental Browser."""
Brett Besag,4.0 out of 5 stars,"1. The Kindle logo being a distraction is nonsense. I feared it was lit, but it isn't. So, if you're reading in a darkened room, you can't see it at all, and if the room is brightly lit, the logo is visible, but so is the world around you. Just silly.
2. Have no clue what people are talking about it not coming with the correct USB. Mine arrived today, and is perfect.
3. The battery charges FAST with a larger Apple iPad ""brick"" and seems to hold a fine charge. The ""2 weeks"" is if you only read 30 min / day.
4. It wakes up fine and responds quickly. What do you expect for a $129 device?
5. Screen is plenty bright, with nice adjustments for font and brightness.
6. The people stating the previous version is just as good as this one... They're likely correct; and is why all the external reviews stated if you own the previous version, and you don't need waterproofing, skip this version... Duh.

Now, I do agree that the large bezel is antiquated, but the overall size, weight and screen readability is amazing. Further, the waterproof is an absolute must, if you've always wanted to read in the hot tub. Score!

One side note... This is my first (ever) e-Reader of any kind (though I've worked in IT for 30+ years, I tend to avoid tech at home). My only true complaint? I'm left-handed. I thereby hold the Kindle with my right hand. To turn the page, I have to cross the screen (and my line of sight) with my left hand to tap on the Kindle's right-edge. Something I have yet to hear mentioned by all you right-handers. But like so many issues us lefties face, I shall overcome! :)

Hope this review helped someone."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"With its small size I’d like to be able to read in landscape mode not just portrait. You just start a sentence and your changing lines. I also would like to the continuous page concept like I have on my kindle books when I read on my iPad. It is easier to flick your thump up or down to advance the continual page then to use the Kindle touch methods.

I do like the backlight and the magnet shutdown feature. The sauce does allow me to take it with me."
B,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This product works fine for eBooks, but the advertising is dishonest and misleading regarding audiobooks.

1) It does not even have a headphone jack. It supposedly can be made to work with Bluetooth headphones.

2) Assuming you have the required hardware, it ONLY WORKS WITH AMAZON PROPRIETARY AUDIBLE AUDIOBOOKS. These are incredibly overpriced except if you pay the monthly subscription. Furthermore, the first book I bought was heavily discounted, which hid the $40 cost per audiobook until after the return window had passed. The plan was to use the OverDrive service for library audiobooks, but Amazon blocks this functionality for audiobooks.

Do not buy for audiobooks unless you are happy to pay for an Audible subscription. I wish I could return it."
Grover Shopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The new waterproof kindle is a nice upgrade from the previous generation kindle that I had before. A couple things that could be improved on:
1) When the kindle is turned on, the backlight comes on a full brightness for several seconds before it dims to your preferred brightness setting. When using the kindle at night, this is really annoying.
2) The trade in offer is a scam. They gave me a credit initially but then when they received my perfectly good previous generation Kindle they rejected it and charged back my credit. Don’t let the offer of a trade in discount influence your decision to buy."
Sandee Whitson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got hooked on Kindle when a friend let me borrow hers. This version is newer than the one my friend has. Better lighting and resolution. The touch screen seems to be just a bit finicky compared to the one I borrowed, though. Overall, however I am satified. It is great that I can listen to my Audible library with this version of Kindle."
AMM80,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Returned it as I wasn’t happy with it. I was surprised how old the technology seemed for the price and current year. The screen quality resembled a black and white Nintendo and even though I turned off the screen refresh (which makes it flash black with every tap/page turn) it still did it every chapter and when going through the main screen. It was very unappealing compared to other technology like iPads/android tablets/etc.

The battery life was fantastic of course because of the level of tech.

The touch screen was not sensitive at all and def took like a full finger tip to turn a page."
Carol K,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love using the kindle to read before bed. I don't need a light and it settles me so i can sleep better. But the darn thing is so sensitive. There's no room for gripping the device without it shooting ahead or behind several pages.

As with all my kindles, what I don't like is being able to go back easily to re-read something or get intro information on a character, which only some of the information comes up when you hold on a name.

The other distraction is browsing books in my library. The first iteration allowed us to file books once they were read or i could create a folder for specific books. I like that. This is a mess. I can't find anything and it's clunky to go from page to page looking."
Catherine Saylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve only had this for four days and have already read two books because I’m that obsessed with it. I love the built in changing light. It works perfect with all lighting situations; outdoor, indoor, nighttime, you name it. I’ve always been a fan of having the actual book in your hands while reading, so for years my collection of books grew bigger and bigger. I can’t believe I didn’t get a kindle earlier in life, I’m in love!"
Blanche T.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had hoped to be able to order an earlier Paperwhite version, but it is not possible. This has physical updates but is as kluge as Kindles have always been. I am really unhappy because my old Kindle is worn out and I find this new version more difficult to use. I am not interested in social media, just in a book reader. Specifically, I have no need for another Bluetooth device AND the new screen now includes the black “frame” rather than there being a separate plastic frame and it shows fingerprints and smudges, which all of my previous Kindles haven’t done."
Bart,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This 10th generation version of the Kindle doesn’t feel as nice as the previous one. Before, the “Kindle” logo on the front was a subtle black color but now there’s a giant white “Kindle” on the front, which is distracting while I’m reading a book. Haven’t these companies learned anything from Apple, that they don’t need to plaster giant logos on their products (especially the front)?

Also, the screen of the previous Kindle was flush with the edge, but now the edge lifts up above the screen so there’s a lip around the front of the device. It makes it feel cheaper and less comfortable to hold."
JPeep,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It works fine and is thinner and lighter as promised.

Don't like the Amazon-designed covers for it."
Amaia,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not happy. I will return this and keep using my old and almost dead paperwhite, even while dying is better than this one."
DrP,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a replacement for my second generation paper white and is a welcome upgrade. Battery life is markedly better as is the bright screen. I do wish that Amazon would do something about the ""experimental browser,"" which is still slow and unreliable. Certain sites cannot be navigated due to display anomalies. Toggling Javascript or reversing display contrast does not correct this."
Christa O.,4.0 out of 5 stars,This Kindle was exactly what I needed. I’ve been hesitant to go electronic because I love an actual book in my hand but this was well worth it. It has plenty of space and I love that if there’s a companion audio I hook my Bluetooth headphones up and listen (no port for wired headphones). The battery life is as long as advertised. I’ve had it for a few months now and only had to charge it a handful of times. My favorite feature has to be the white paper feature. You can literally read in any lighting situation! Definitely recommend!
Swado,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this eReader specifically for the audible option. I have owned it less than 1 year. At issue is the FAILURE of the bluetooth option to pair with my earbuds. I have restarted the eReader multiple times and did a factory reset more than once without success. My earbuds pair flawlessly with my Fire Tablet, my iPad and iPod.
I contacted Amazon via chat/messaging. The service rep was patient and instructed me to do the same old restarts and resets but it did not fix the problem. Because the product is less than 1 yr old, I asked for a new KINDLE eReader. I was told, I would have to pay $15-$20 for a new eReader. To me, that answer is not acceptable. I am NOT a happy customer!!!!"
Alicia L.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s not faster than my old kindle (2 years old). If anything it feels slower to wake up (every time I press the power button to wake it, it has to “warm up” for several seconds; whereas the old kindle just wakes up). Dictionary lookup is faster on the old kindle.

Backlight and resolution upgrade are pluses. Clearer to read than the older version. I don’t read in the dark (it’s bad for your eyes even with backlight), so the backlight is totally optional to me.

Backcover material is soft and smooth, feels much better than plain plastic on the old kindle.

I feel that the old kindle has the perfect weight, I don’t need any holders or cover on it. This new version makes my left hand feel tired. (I had to get a pop socket so my hand doesn’t hurt)."
Steph3414,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a bit skeptical of some of the reviews but this is my second Kindle and I am extremely impressed. my battery is on three weeks now. I have had no problem whatsoever with the built-in ads either. oddly, I rather look forward to seeing the ads because they are only visible on the screen when the Kindle first Powers up. twice now I have seen a book advertise that I would like. Once you swipe to open your Kindle the ad is completely gone and there is no further interruption while you are reading. Absolutely painless.

The device is lightweight, thin and durable. So far an excellent product as long as it lasts."
Kate,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband and I were looking for an e-reader that was more like reading an actual book due to the headaches our screens were causing. We got the larger 32 gig hoping to be able to enjoy both books an audio books and so far so great! I love the water proof feature, makes it easy for bath reading and this summer, boat reading! The only complaints we’ve experienced so far is the lag time from when you push a button to the device responding, sometimes it doesn’t respond and you have to repeat pushing buttons and then sometimes it will ‘catch up’ and you’ll end up pushing 3 buttons at once. We also thought the downloadable books would be a more affordable option to physical books but so far they’re about the same and in many cases more expensive. All in all, this kindle is great and will be incredible for when we’re traveling but for home life we still love having an actual book in our hands"
J. Poole,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had most versions of Kindle (except for Oasis) and just bought this new Paperwhite to replace my old Voyage purely to get the waterproof feature. This kindle is fine, feels a bit clunkier than the Voyage which was thinner and sleeker. I never needed a case for the Voyage and used it for years with no case.

The issue with the Paperwhite is they have gone back to having the power button on the bottom instead of the back. Since I frequently stand up my Kindle and read while I’m doing other things, I find having the power button on the bottom again means it turns itself on and off a lot while I have it standing up, which of course the Voyage never did because the power button was on the back.

So I had to buy a stand/case to use with this Paperwhite. That is fine, but makes the whole thing thicker and clunkier. But overall it’s fine and a good reading experience."
Sherri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Had first generation Kindle that I had to have a book like to read in the dark. I had wanted to upgrade to paper white for along time but waited until my original Kindle gave up working. I love being able to travel with so much reading material on this one small device and my new paper white is lighter and slimmer and a little small which I love. had no trouble setting it up . The paper white allows me to adjust light on the screen to my comfort level. Also like adjustments to text size especially since my eyes are not what they used to be. I hope to have many years with my new Kindle paper white.
FatMac,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the improvements especially the lighting in dark conditions. Not a single complaint. Unsure about Bluetooth though. Didn’t set that up and probably won’t. Kudos to Amazon development people
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As a previous kindle user (2018? model), I didn't find a significant difference between the kindle and kindle paperwhite to warrant an upgrade unless waterproof function is needed (my reason for the upgrade). The kindle paperwhite still has a slight lag when turning pages or accessing the right click equivalent features similar to the kindle. The built in light is nice but is not a deal breaker. The eye strain from reading is still present with using the kindle device compared to using a tablet. In terms of the battery life, it felt as though Kindle's battery life lasted longer than that of paperwhite. However, paperwhite by no means has poor battery life especially when comparing to popular tablets. ONE ANNOYING PART, depending on the orientation of the kindle paperwhite within a coat, bag, or other carrying device, the power gets pressed on easily (perhaps contributing the seemingly shorter battery life). If you want a dedicated reading device, get it when it's on sale. Not sure if it is worth the full price if you have other devices that can be used for reading."
yazhigrl101,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When e-readers were first coming out, I was gifted with my first e-reader, a first generation Nook (Barnes & Noble). This is diffidently a huge improvement of my first e-reader.

Firstly, the battery life is wonderful. I got this for Christmas, charged it up that day, and at this point, after using it for about 20 minutes to half an hour everyday, that battery is only at 70%. I haven't charged it once since then, and it's been about three weeks. The pages do look like actual pages from a book, but the screen is bright enough that I could probably read in dim lighting. It took a bit of playing with it to figure out how to manage to go from a book page to the home page (touch the upper left corner of the page you are reading), but once I did it has been super easy to download books and go from reading list to wish list. I haven't had it anywhere near water, so I can't speak for the water-proof function, but I can tell you I most definitely love this little e-reader, and take it with me everywhere :)"
AIto,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I replaced my original Kindle with the Kindle Paperwhite because I was unable to complete the update that would allow it to connect online. My original works fine, but it's capacity without the update is limited. As far as the new Paperwhite, I can't say that I was overjoyed at having to spend an extra $20 just to get ads for books that I would never read in a million years removed my home screen. My original Kindle was much classier - with photos of authors on the home screen instead of a sales pitch. I've had a chance to use my new Kindle Paperwhite, and it seems to be fine. The first thing I did was charge and download the new software, which I would recommend that anyone with any device do upon purchase. As far as using the new Kindle, I miss the tapered edges of my old Kindle which to me was a little easier to hold, but I'm sure I will get used to the new one. The screen resolution is good, and all of the features and items in the menu seem pretty intuitive. I downloaded a book and opened it and began reading it - reading for me was fine. I gave the new Kindle one less star because someone made the decision to include those ads and charge a fee for removal - is that really needed?"
J. Aldrich,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Kindle after many years using the Kindle app on my iPad mini. So, no experience with the devices, but after a month my initial disappointment is confirmed. My main issue is screen brightness, or rather the lack thereof. Set to maximum, the brightness level is roughly equal to the iPad set at 25%. With no prior experience with any Kindle, I have no idea if that is reasonable, or sign of defective unit.
The second issue is with page turning. Occasionally a single tap will overreact and advance anywhere from 2 to 10 pages, and the ensuing inconsistent response to attempts to get back on track can be quite irritating.
All in all, I'm glad I bought it (at a very large promotional discount), but at full retail I'm not sure I'd be so forgiving. Maybe I just got a dud unit? I'll see what comments this gets and do a follow up if warranted."
Angela,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle so I cant compare it to anything else. I've only had it for a few days and I love it. It takes no time to load after being in sleep mode. The ads are only on the home screen and it's really not worth the extra $30 to remove them. Some of them are actually very useful and suggests great books and offers. I love the audible feature. It is a bit of a pain when you turn it on and it ends up reading everything you click on. I'm not sure if there is a way to turn that off and still have it connected to bluetooth. Like I said, this is my first one so I'm still getting used to it. I had no issues with a glare when I read it outside. It does not strain your eyes If you read it in the dark. So far I think it's great and I would recommend it."
Ellen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite is awesome outside. There really is no glare at all! The battery is fantastic and lasts for weeks at a time. Two small negatives. The operating system can be a little slow when you are trying to find a book in your library or trying to find a book in the store. There is a definitely lag, and the screen actually changes color when it is trying to catch up. The other negative is where the power button is. Because the power button is on the bottom, I find that I accidentally turn off the Kindle because my hand is holding it from the bottom. It shuts off suddenly and I think the battery died until I realized I accidentally pressed the off button."
wei chen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have been using precision three generations of Kindle In the last many years. So far this is the best one. Love the flash surface design, much easy to clean the dust. New version of the software is also much easier to use and much smoother compared to previous ones. Personally I don’t think the Oasis design is better than this. One minor thing is the screen color, found one small region with slightly uneven color compared to other parts, but barely noticeable. One thing I wish it can have is the switch between Amazon Kindle US store and China store. That way I can read both English and Chinese books without sign in and out, which is very painful experience.."
casovas,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m so disappointed in the new kindle paperwhite, they really missed the mark on this “upgrade”. I’ve been an ebook reader since the original kindles and nooks came out. After using this for a few days, I’m now going to use my old kindle paperwhite and let my kid have this new version. My biggest complaint is that there is no edge, it’s smooth and slippery across the whole screen. I keep accidentally jumping pages and don’t love how it feels in my hand (I don’t use a case). There’s much more of a glare on this version do to the glossier screen which the old version didn’t have. I do like that it’s waterproof but I wouldn’t ever use it submerged in the pool, just sitting along side it, so to me that’s not a selling point. And finally, battery life... I just got this a few days ago, charged it to 100% and I’m already down to 70%! The prior version took weeks to get to 70%, not days. Not sure what is sucking battery life but that needs to be addressed. I hope amazon listens to their customers and ditches this version soon. I’m happily back to using the previous version."
Danielle R Ryan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had it for a few weeks but really used it for the first time today. I was partially shaded for about 30 minutes when I got a message saying it was getting too hot and was going to shut off. It was only about 80 degrees outside. I bought it because I live in a very sunny place. I thought the Paperwhite would be easier to read outside than using the Kindle app on my Samsung tablet. It is a lot easier to read but if it's going to overheat, what's the point? I also cannot seem to get the Paperwhite to sync with my Samsung. I don't hate it but I am not really happy with it."
Daniel Lay,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I take this device on trail with me, and I can protect from bumps and bruises but I can't always protect it from moisture. It rocks for that reason.

What I'm not too thrilled with is the organization system. Maybe it's because I'm new to the kindle world, but I was kind of shocked that there wasn't a folder system and the way to organize your files and books was kind of tedious (building ""Collection"") The caveat is that I utilize mainly PDFs of documents that I need in the field. While the kindle loads and views those fine, they are not synced to the cloud (and my other devices) since they were added on directly from my pc (as opposed to downloading them from amazon). Also since there is only one level of folders (""Collection""), I ended up having to create a bunch of collections and just organize them by title, and since they are not on the cloud, I couldn't build the collection on my pc or online which would have been easier.

Overall I think the device is great, and once I figure out the best way to organize all my files, I believe I'll be pretty satisfied with it.

Build quality and everything else about it is great.

Maddie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was always hesitant to purchase a Kindle because I have sensitive eyes and I was concerned that anything other than a “real book” would be uncomfortable. My friend gave me their old Paperwhite. I was pleasantly surprised. I wanted the newest one, mostly because the charging plug portal was loose and presented a problem. Bottom line...I love it. So convenient to carry with me."
PA Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve used the Kindle app for iPad for years and for the most part liked it, but I can’t read it outside and in bright light. So, while on vacation, after I couldn’t use the iPad to read on the porch overlooking the ocean, I ordered the Paperwhite. It arrived while I was still there, and it worked perfectly outside and in any light. Now, if I’m reading a novel, I use the Paperwhite, always. I still use the iPad for books with charts, diagrams, tables, illustrations. But for just reading, it’s not a question that I’ll use the Paperwhite. Plus, the fact that it only does one thing—provide a medium for reading, without distractions of texts, email, the internet in general—has actually made it the extra device that reduces my use of electronic devices. If that makes sense."
Natalie Thompson-Phillips,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like how lightweight it is. It was easy to navigate upon initial startup. I didn't care for all my books being listed all the time even if they were not downloaded but still listed as I will have to delete one at a time. And WiFi is on all the time where as my old one I could turn on and off and save battery life also I could control what WiFi I used for security. The battery does not last as long as stated even with the light down low but still last a for a few days ( prob because I read a lot ) so that is least of my misgivings. Over all I am please with my Kindle purchase and would recommend it to others as well. Good value for the money and I love the 5 payment option as I live on fixed income so I am able to do nice things for myself over time. Thanks Again .. I recommend the new Paper White over all ...
Jeff Bay,3.0 out of 5 stars,"they really seem to have gone for ""more design with less focus on usability"" because it looks sleeker and nicer but it is actually not as good as the prior model.

- the screen doesn't get as dim as the old one, which is annoying when you are trying to go to sleep and want to put the font way up and the light way down.
- the glossier finish makes it feel slippier - i had to rough mine up with sandpaper so i didn't feel like i was going to sling it across the room
- the off button is super easy to hit, including WHEN YOU REST IT ON A SHELF, which i do frequently to read while standing for various reasons. i had to superglue pieces of zip tie on the bottom of it to protect the stupid button from being pressed when i didn't want to.

these all seem like common, inbuilt problems that could be solved with a small amount of user testing and feedback. *sigh*. on the other hand, it is the best reader i've used, so there's that."
S. McGinn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got my first Kindle years ago. Moved up to the Paperwhite, and have been using that for about 4 years, and it finally wore out and would not turn off any more, so I ordered a new Paperwhite. I take my Kindle everywhere...I always toss it into my purse, so I can catch a few minutes reading time whenever...such as when I sit in the car while hubby runs into a store or puts gas in the car, etc. We are retired and enjoy RV travel. Before we leave on a trip, I make sure I have at least 3 books loaded and qued to travel with. So easy to grab a Kindle and not juggle books...I really love mine!"
Matt McManus,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First, the unit seems to be working as advertised. BUT, the day after it arrived in the mail, the unit locked up and would not turn off. The next morning the battery was dead. I charged it for several hours and the unit has been working normally since then. My concern is that it will fail down the road, probably right after the warranty runs out. But it is working fine now. The other problem I had was the trade in program. I traded in my older Kindle reader. They said they would give me $15 for it. I thought that was low but went ahead with the tradein. It worked fine, and it had no cracks or problems. Then when I sent it in, they lowered my tradein to $5. They said it would not boot up and it had a cracked screen. It could have happend in shipping but I padded it well. The unit was in good shape when I returned it. I probably will not use their tradein program again."
Norman D. Marks,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th Kindle, but not an improvement over the previous model. (I had to replace it as the battery was no longer retaining much of a chge.)

I have a couple major issues.

1. It is difficult to hold without turning it off! The power button at the bottom of the device is in wrong place, my hand tends to rest on or near it, and very sensitive.

2. It's not very fast, even seems slower than the previous model!

In addition, it is not comfortable to hold. The shape seems odd and poorly designed to fit the hand.

I wish I hadn't had to replace the previous model."
Jamie B,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had enjoyed a Kindle Paperwhite for years and after receiving annual emails to upgrade, I decided to do so because of the waterproofing/water resistant feature. My Kindle Paperwhite was in working order, and I went to trade in my old device. I packed the old Kindle Paperwhite in the Amazon box that I received my new Kindle Paperwhite in, bubble wrapped the device and put it in a bubble wrapped padded envelope inside the Amazon box. I received an email from Amazon downgrading my $25 credit to a $5 credit. When I called customer service to find out why, I was told my old Kindle Paperwhite had a cracked screen. THAT WAS NOT THE CASE WHEN IT WAS SHIPPED. In any event, I don't want the old Kindle Paperwhite back that now has a cracked screen, although I would have kept my old Kindle Paperwhite and given it to a child in my neighborhood. Perhaps something happened in the Amazon warehouse. I'll never know. TAKE PICTURES OF YOUR TRADE-IN-DO NOT TRUST AMAZON'S PROCESS! I spent close to an hour with customer service who will continue to look into the matter, but I really don't want other customers to have to go through this process. If you want to upgrade, don't do so based on the trade-in value. The new Kindle Paperwhite is nice ( a little thinner, a little sharper screen and advertised to be waterproof), but if you already have a working Kindle Paperwhite, I don't see the need to upgrade. Certainly, don't do so if the $25 credit makes the difference in your decision making process. Once you send in the trade-in, you are at Amazon's mercy."
Amazon User,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I put off buying a kindle for several years, since I had a laptop that I sometimes used for reading e-books. I'm so glad I finally decided to buy one! I like it much more than I expected. It is a very handy size to take along (much easier than trying to shove a paperback into my overloaded purse!) It's lightweight and easy to hold for my arthritic hands, and the adjustable font size and brightness levels are a huge plus for reading in various lighting, from bright light to complete darkness. (No more spending evenings reading in the hotel bathroom to avoid disturbing my very-early-to-bed husband by having the light on!)
It holds a library's worth of e-books, and Amazon has a lot more readily available. The battery lasts quite a while on a charge, and recharges fairly fast when needed.
The bottom line is, I love it! Thanks, Amazon!"
Lisette Ross,1.0 out of 5 stars,I upgraded to the newest kindle paperwhite. It included the subscription to Audible and over the ear POP headphones. I have been enjoying the headphones which I synced with my iPad for music and to listen to audible using my iPad. The few times that I have attempted to use my kindle i had to charge it because the battery was completely drained. There is no way that this battery stays charged for 6 weeks without use!
Tim P.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle. I had used a Nook in the past, and I wanted to give kindle a go. So far, I really enjoy it. The screen responds to my touch significantly better than my Nook did. The unit was a little bit smaller than I imagined, but after using it for a week, I actually like how compact it is. I really wish there were some page buttons. There are times where I accidentally tap the screen while reading and it jumps to a different page. I'd also like to see future models have a screen that goes from edge to edge (if my phone can do it, I am sure Amazon can design a kindle that can). Overall, great product with a lot of potential!"
Don B,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my kindle reader. I've been reading on my phone for years, but recently my first kindle. It certainly is a lot easier to read on than my phone. Two primary flaws. The touch screen is awful when compared to my phone, but I guess that is something you have to live with when using E-Ink. The second pain point is where the power button is located. Really at the bottom. I've turned the think off so many times because its in the worst possible spot. Why not the top? Otherwise its a great product. Can read easily in direct sun (beach), I don't worry about dropping it in water, and the battery life is so good I'm surprised when it tells me I'm low on power."
KMK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an iPad Pro but it is too big and heavy to carry to my book club in my Vera Bradley Little Hipster shoulder bag. The Kindle Paper White 10th generation I received two weeks ago is perfect. It is very light, fits in my purse and it is still on its initial charge. (17 days at 65% charge). The leather cover doesn’t add any extra bulk or weight. It protects the screen and automatically wakes the Kindle when I open. The magnet back is convenient when I want to hold in one hand."
Jeannie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it. I am new to Kindle and to e-readers. I have read books on my iPad and phone before due to the convenience, but always preferred physical books. This is the best of both worlds: distraction-free, reflection-free reading on a paper-like surface with the convenience of purchasing and downloading an entire library of books at a moment's notice. (And books are way cheaper for Kindle!). I love how small the device is (smaller and lighter than most paperbacks!), and it fits in my smallest purse to make it much easier for me to always carry a book with me. Use your local public library's Overdrive service to read most of what you want for free. This includes current best sellers."
A.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd kindle. Obviously, I have liked the first 2. I am astounded at how fast the battery empties on this one. I can charge it overnight and the battery will run out the next day. I've tried multiple times to connect it to my bluetooth headphones and it cannot find them. When I called for help with the bluetooth, I was left on hold for so long I gave up and hung up. I would NOT recommend this product :("
FeelingGood,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased the paper white for a friend who had an older Kindle that was no longer holding a charge. Bought it as a bundle with cover and charger. Thought the price was good but upon receipt, I read the ""fine"" print to realize that the lower price was because it contained ""ads"". Fortunately, I could pay another $20 and keep the item ad free. For the friend this was a much better deal. Anyway the Kindle is very much appreciated. They like the touch screen and especially the feature about changing the font size. Hopefully they won't get a chance to try the waterproofness although they do read while they are sit by the pool...."
Ary Cinder,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like it once you are reading a book. It is difficult to navigate the settings and you can't change the size of the font or pictures until u are reading a book, so I have a hard time browsing the store. I will literally pick a book on my phone which I can enlarge the picture and then sync my kindle so I can read it. It is also difficult to get back to home once you are in a book.

I have the kindleunlimited plan and that's why I ultimately choose to go with kindle.

My husband has Kobo ereader and he loves it. Has a built in light and easy to navigate. I like the kindle I just think it needs to work on its programming, compared to others its way behind."
LivingMyBestLife🌹,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m sorry but I’m not happy at all . I ordered this , anticipated on its arrival . Logged in and after 20 minutes it just started shutting off , different book pages started popping up similar like a computer virus . Decided I wasn’t going to deal with this , already upset about non fitting case that aren’t returnable. I submitted a return but to my prevail I received an email requesting I call support to troubleshoot my paperwhite. Why!!!!! I had this same issue with other kindles and book readers and I’ve had enough ."
dbest57,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This paperwhite was a gift from my son to replace my old Kindle keyboard. Well, my old kindle works better than this new one, that’s for sure! The touchscreen is non-responsive for minutes on end and then will jump between 6/7 pages a dozen times before stopping on one I’ve read already. I don’t even have to touch it and it will start jumping pages again. Come on Amazon, surely you can do better than $120 for a book that can’t be read. The battery and light got 1 Star too simply because they do no good if the book can’t be read. Back it goes. I hope it was a fluke and the replacement is better but somehow I’m losing faith in Amazon products."
Sarah Spence,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviews on this kindle were definitely mixed. Those that previously had a paperwhite were not thrilled about this new version. My husband and I however have not interacted with a Kindle since the first generation years ago. We got these so we can share books when we are apart and work on reading more and getting into a routine. These kindles are very lightweight, have a lot of ""paper"" options for text size, color, brightness, etc., and supposedly waterproof? I don't plan on reading in the pool or tub, but it makes me feel like it is a little more durable. So far these have been great and we are loving that we can share books in the ""household"" through amazon."
Val,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the kindle. It’s great in full sun and the light adjustment is very helpful. I don’t like that the kindle is not as easy to use as the kindle app on my iPad. I find it cumbersome to find a book and go forward in the book.
I am disappointed in this aspect. I have so many books and it’s not simple to organize them. I actually gave up.
I gave up on a few aspects as I thought would work better.
The battery life is excellent but I am not using it as much as I thought I would. I resent that I wanted this and it’s not as easy as advertised. The app is easier that makes no sense."
Suzanne C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th Kindle in the last 8 years (Touch 2011, Paperwhite 2013, and Voyager 2015). It has so many great
improvements: very responsive touch screen, wide range of lighting choices, Bluetooth for audio books, lots of
storage (8GB), longer life battery and the price is reasonable! And it’s waterproof too! I can’t think of anything I don’t like."
A. Baldwin,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I partook of the ""trade in"" offered on my old Kindle via an email from Amazon. It worked just fine and had no cracks in the screen ( as I was asked and reported.) Now they have debited my account for the amount of my initial trade in ($25) claiming it wasn't received"" in the condition I reported"". I understand if AMAZON didn't want to go give me ADDITIONAL credit on my trade in, but taking the $25 I already had is just wrong. I would not have even done it if I didn't think I was going to save some money. I use Amazon at least once a week, subscribe to Prime Video and Kindle Unlimited. UGH. I feel totally ripped off. Bezos has enough money - please stop taking my money. I have to work over 2 hours to make $25."
Patlaw,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned a much earlier push button model of Kindle Reader for many years that is still working. The Kindle Paperwhite model is almost too small for my hands but I like it better the more I use it. The touch screen is easy to use and seems to function well. The back of the Kindle is rather slippery and the case I purchased with it is not much better. I hope they soon come out with a case with a rubberized back to help provide a better grip. Aside from these minor criticisms, I believe that it will take care of my Kindle needs for several years to come. So far, a very good experience overall."
V.A. Washburn,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a new Kindle Paperwhite Generation 10 in December 2018. It will hold a charge for about 3 days at my normal usage. It will lose 12 % of its charge just hibernating overnight. I read from one to three hours a day. I have had less than fifty books loaded on this Kindle since I got it. I have switched out power adapters and power supply cords, and they all produce the same result.

I have an old Kindle Paperwhite that I bought in 2013 that has 1,000 books loaded on it, and it still will hold a charge for at least 3 weeks. I bought a new one because the old one is getting some glitches in it and needs to be shutdown often.

The life of the Gen 10 battery was so shocking to me, that I thought I had received a faulty Paperwhite, so I sent it in for warranty service and got it back with an email saying: “We’ve reloaded the latest software onto your device, run it through our diagnostic process, and confirmed that it is working correctly. Your device should now be fully functional and is being shipped back to you.”

It works exactly the same.

Amazon’s claimed weeks of battery life is based on: 1) reading ½ hour a day (what person who truly loves reading reads that little?), 2) WiFi turned off (no more definitions or notes), and 3) light turned down to 10. I use a Kindle because I read very fast. I would have to take five to six books on a six-hour flight to have enough reading material. I also go camping for a week several times during the summer where there are no phone signals, no power, and no internet, just to be out in nature and read. Following all the rules, I will have about 3 days of reading before my Kindle is dead. Since 2013 I have taken my 6th generation paperwhite on these trips and had plenty of power for the week. My really old Kindle which I bought 12-15 years ago also held a charge for weeks.

I am so very disappointed that the new Paperwhite does not live up to Amazon’s former versions. How can a company take such a great produce and ruin it? I would buy a brand-new older generation kindle Paperwhite like my last one if there was one available, but I haven’t found one.
I’m at a loss!"
England,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The built in light is ok I guess, but I would like it to be able to go all the way out (dark) so that I can just use a reading light with it, because I try to avoid lighted screens before bed.

My complaint is that a touch screen means that it's very easy to accidentally turn the page. It's also hard to navigate. For example, if I'm trying to swipe my way through my library, I often accidentally open a book that my finger has touched during my swipe. There have been times that suddenly I find my self many pages away from where I was. I still haven't figure out how that happens."
Don Woods,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like that it weighs practically nothing, so you can, as their ads say, read for a long time without your hand getting tired.
The pages turn fast, so you don't wait for a page to load, and the light is bright so you can read anywhere.
I like it remembers the page you were on, so when you close the device and open it again, it goes back to the same page.
I prefer a paper book, but I travel a lot, and I can't take 100 books with me, but I can sure take the Kindle.
The only thing that it lacks, and that is annoying, is that you can't see any page numbers, so when you ask it to 'go back', you get generalities (like 'Beginnng') instead of a specific page.
Overall, I'm really happy with it and take it everywhere."
Steve A. Landis,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Paperwhite works just fine. Reports of the device taking a long while to boot proved incorrect, as the unit turns on quickly. The display is crisp with no problems. I have not tested the water-proof performance and probably won't as I do not tend to read whilst in the water or rain. I do not have a clue which version of the Kindle Amazon believes this new model is lighter than; it is a thick brick compared to my Voyage, which, based on short use of the new PaperWhite, I intend to continue using. This purchase was made to replace a much older Kindle which I believe was similar in thickness and weight. As to the increased memory? I agree with just about everyone else, who cares? I only keep new books on my Voyage. Everything else stays in the Cloud. I'm glad to have a backup Kindle, which will in this case be used by my spouse if he so desires. Honestly, I don't see this version of the Kindle being a game-changer for Amazon or for users. As noted, I'm quite happy with my Voyage. Last, based on my quick review of the Oasis, I don't lean toward replacing my Voyage any time soon."
Sandeep Parande,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Feels light in the hands

Water resistance rating unnecessary but nice to have, makes it feel tougher and rugged to know it can withstand water

Experimental browser not completely useless but I was hoping for something closer to what my phone can do

Haven’t played around with all the tricks it can do in an E-book but if the YouTube videos about its features are accurate than it should make this be a fun little gadget to making reading “fun”.

Backlighting is excellent, wide range of lighting ability for any condition. Better on the eyes in pitch black darkness than a phone."
Hollyellen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm surprised how much I like this, after being a confirmed paper-only book reader before. I'm 71. Going on vacation soon. Wanted to lighten the load and still take plenty of books. I have a BA in English Lit and MA in Communications. Can't survive without reading material and I'm choosy about what I want to read. I did my research and decided on the new PaperWhite and glad I did. I got the cork cover. Got a deal on Prime Day. Paid extra to NOT have the advertising - or special offers or whatever they called it. I want to open the thing and read and not have to scroll through unwelcome suggestions. So far so good!"
Amazonreadsreviews,1.0 out of 5 stars,"***Update 6/5/19***
The kindles battery life now lasts barely two days. I charged it yesterday to 100 percent and this morning its already back to 65. And yes. Power saving mode and airplane mode is on. I wish I had returned this and stayed with my old paperwhite because this one is a p.o.s.
The kindle is slow reacting to wake up and turn pages at times. It drains its battery faster than any other kindle I've had before. The battery is suppose to last weeks and I've never had it last more than 5 days. I had a replacement sent and same thing. Only reason i bought this one to replace my other kindle paperwhite was because of the extended battery life and water proof. So far pretty disappointed."
Nicole M. Betz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replaced my original paper white. The controls to change the style or size of font make it easy to read the words. The brightness controls make it easy to read anywhere. I love that I can now read in the bathtub or pool without fear of damaging my paper white.
If you are an avid reader this is a great digital reader. I have an extensive collection of digital books, but also borrow many digital books from the public library.
I love the convenience that a kindle provides when traveling. I can take a whole stack of books with me anywhere in a thin tablet device."
AD,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really thought i'd love it, but I don't. They physical device is great. It's small and lightweight and I love that about it.
However, I find that the operating system is clunky. I have to tap just the right spot to turn the pages which can be annoying. Also, it doesn't sync very well with my other kindle apps on my cell phone and tablet. And worse of all, sometimes it will just shut down while i'm reading! And I don't mean after a while, but moments after I turn the page. Also, there is a significant glare if i'm under an overhead light. I'm actually kind of disappointed. I really thought it would be a better device considering Kindle has been around for a while. One good thing: The battery life is pretty great."
Robin Hodder,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth kindle as my kids got me using one very early in the life of kindles. I love my kindle. If you took it away I would be devastated. Doesn't matter that I can read on my phone or tablet. My kindle is my friend.
It is always difficult to adjust to the upgrades in any software. My previous kindle- not a paperwhite- was like wearing my favorite sweater. I now have a paperwhite and after I turn it on, the resemblance gets fuzzy.

It is annoying that the books come up with suggestions. I don't mind that on my phone, but when I open my kindle, I am there to read. I don't want all that -- on my kindle. I have learned to turn the library into a list instead of having icons. If you look at the icons, it is hard to see the title of the book!! I am there to read.

What I really do not like. I hate swiping to page forward. I hate tapping to page forward. If you are holding the kindle with your left hand, you can't tap to page forward. If you swipe, you need two hands.
One of the things that got me off the physical books and made me love the kindle was that I can lay in bed and hold the kindle with one hand and hit that page forward button. One handed operation. That is gone for me. Having the touch screen often results in the book jumping to a page by accident and then you have to figure out what page you are on. It is soooo irritating. It makes me sad because I loved my previous kindle. After the dog got it...... I was forced to get the new one.
I am actually angry that that button is gone. I think you need a hybrid. And after you design it you should give me one for free. I continue to try to acclimate to my new paperwhite, but it is hard to give up convenience, for what the new hot technology is. Because sometimes, the new hot technology is flawed."
Nancy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was happy to see that it downloaded all the books from my old kindle.
The set up procedure was not too bad. Be ready to enter your WiFi password.
The on/off switch is still on the bottom edge, so I have to place a rolled up napkin under one side when I prop up the kindle on a flat surface, as when I am eating.
The battery is better, but not as good as they say, or maybe I just use mine more.
The entire front is pretty much smooth, so get a good grip on it. It is pretty much impossible to pick up off the floor with a reacher.
I had to give up my first kindle because the battery died after a good many years of use."
Steve W. Jackson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I must admit that I'm still adapting to reading via Kindle and would *much* rather hold a book. But overall, I like it pretty well. The promise of ""weeks"" of battery life isn't being fulfilled, though, even though my reading is almost entirely at bedtime every night. I'm into my third book since getting the device and fell to about 18% last night. But that's not a deal-breaker. Perhaps the most difficult adjustment is that there's no sense of where I am in the book, since I'm comfortable with page numbers and a larger reading area on a physical book. If you're like me and really prefer holding a book, the Kindle may have the same effect on you. But because of the savings on books I purchase, it'll pay for itself sometime in the next few months."
Ryan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing. It makes my book hobby not only more manageable it saves space as well as giving reasonable prices.

The only issue I have with this product is the lack of memory options. Sure 30+ gb of memory is good, but for those like me who enjoy manga, and light novels they take up alot more data than standard books. Unfortunately there's no memory card options for this tablet so once you max out the memory there's likely no way to extend your library. I think you can re download books onto the kindle if you delete some to male room, but I'm not sure.

Overall it's a great product with a reasonable flaw."
Pamela Piotrowski,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have one of the 2nd generation Kindles which has served me fine over the years. Lured by the new smaller format and backlighting, I went with an all new Paperwhite. kindel. I have found it much more difficult to navigate and wanted to download books for a European trip, I was not successful. Thinking it was only the wifi, I tried again once I was home. It is much more difficult to search for titles or browse the NY times best seller list (not available). Maybe it is just me, but the only thing I have been able to access and read was the user guide. Which didn't help me either. The icons are so large you can only see a few titles at a time. So far not much of a fan and I really wanted this to feel like a great upgrade to my old kindle."
Ashley G,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a 1st gen Kindle and I’ve been wanting to upgrade for a while. This is my Christmas present that I get to enjoy a few weeks early.

I’ve read several books on it so far and here are my current impressions:

It’s lightweight and easy to hold for prolonged read sessions. The built in light is great. The battery life is great. I’ve read 2 full books and a bunch of random sections of others before needing a charge.

The touch screen isn’t as responsive as I would hope but it’s way better than have to use button to navigate.

Very happy with the kindle. It has been a joy to read on it."
Diana,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Kindle Paperwhite 2018 edition, 8 GB of storage with Special Offers for myself because up until I received it, I've been reading with the Kindle app on my Samsung Galaxy S9 phone instead. While the Kindle app on my phone was great, my eyes were really straining on the smaller screen and I'm a voracious reader. I was looking for something in a larger screen, but won't utilize the other feature and capabilities of a tablet, and beyond Kindle have no use for one at all. Overall, I'm highly impressed with this little Kindle device.

I want to start by mentioning the Special Offers, as in all the reviews I read and heard about the device, the Special Offers weren't more than a footnote. They aren't intrusive at all, it's just on the main screen and that's it. They don't interrupt reading at all, and the Kindle Paperwhite personalized my Special Offers based on my reading, Kindle browsing history, and purchases so a lot of the ads that come through are actually interesting to me and in fact one or two of the ads have made me drool enough to purchase whatever book they were trying to peddle. That is definitely a plus, and yet a terrible thing because I AM such a voracious reader and I know I'm going to be spending a lot more money on Kindle books but at least the majority of the ads are tailored to the type of books I enjoy reading. I'm definitely not complaining about the Special Offers, nor will I pay to have them removed when the next ad that is displayed on my Kindle's screen might be a book I might like. Some may find the ads annoying just because it's an ad, but I find it enjoyable and definitely not intrusive in the slightest.

The battery life - the Kindle came out of the box at 60% battery life and took virtually no time at all to charge to 100% on my phone's quick charger. I spent from 3 pm until almost 11 pm doing nothing but reading (when I said I'm a voracious reader, I meant it). My Kindle went from 100% battery to only 81% and from 11 pm until 8:30 am, only lost 2% battery. That is absolutely amazing to me and worth every penny I spent on the Kindle. I can't do that with my phone or a tablet; those batteries drain so quickly but this Kindle will last me all day long and still won't need to be charged at night. That's such a huge plus for a reader like me!

The light on the Kindle Paperwhite is amazing, and even in my dimly lit room I don't need to have it much above 5 or 6 on the brightness. Although my phone boasts an almost 6"" screen, truly the Kindle screen is much larger and thus much easier to read especially with the matte finish. My eyes strain far less on the Kindle even with almost a solid 8 or more hours of nothing but reading. This Kindle screen isn't too large, but it's definitely not too small either, it's just right. It's almost like you have a physical book in your hand, as far as relative size goes, though a little larger than your common paperback.

I don't use Audible because I can't pay attention to a book when I'm listening to it being read to me, so the 8 GB of storage (more like close to 6 GB usable), holds plenty of books for me. I only have just a handful downloaded at any one point in time, but even the 10 or so books I have downloaded at once still doesn't take the storage space down anywhere near the 5 GB mark. So 8 GB is more than plenty for just regular printed books if you're like me and suddenly develop a case of A.D.D. when it comes to audiobooks.

The speed of the device is just fine too. I won't say it's excellent compared to my Galaxy S9, but that's apples and oranges. For an e-reader the speed is great. There is just a little lag, but not enough to become anything beyond just barely noticeable. It's not annoying at all. It takes maybe a second or so to respond. When turning the page, even reading at a quick pace I'm able to keep up with the story on the next page from where it left off without interruption.

The overall build quality is excellent. It is light weight and thinner than I expected. Yes it's plastic, but it doesn't feel cheaply made. It's comfortable to hold in one hand, or two if you like. The only thing I would change about the build is the power button - maybe I'm just used to them being on the right side of the device near the top... but the only thing I would change is the placement of the button.

Overall, I'm very satisfied and impressed with my purchase. This was an excellent buy, and my next Kindle purchase is going to be one for a couple other people in my life who read just as voraciously as I do."
Brian J. Styrwoll,3.0 out of 5 stars,"There is a lot to like about the paperwhite 4: the screen is sharp and responsive, the light is nice and even, and I love the flush bezel.

Unfortunately, it's just bizarre how Amazon chooses to stop short on the design thinking that goes into it's flagship product.

Firstly, and let's just get this out of the way: the firmware for kindles has always been poorly thought-out, and this iteration is no different. The navigation within books is as bad an experience as it's ever been, and there are WAY too many different places to have to search in order to adjust a setting.

Secondly, Amazon used to pitch the kindle as an upgrade to the experience of reading a book. And while they have made some progress with the aforementioned screen and light, they still haven't really done anything to address one of the last hold-over issues: that if you want to dig in for a couple-hours-long reading session, it's still kind of awkward to hold this object in front of your face for that long.

Amazon markets a line of cases and covers (that typically run 3X the price of most 3rd party options), yet none of them do anything to improve the experience of tactilely interacting with the product. I've tried a couple, and if anything, they just add bulk and weight. Amazon offers no options with straps or handles, which means if you want
something like that, you're forced into the same QA-deficient 3rd party jungle that has saturated the market for iphone accessories.

This, to me, just seems like such a glaring oversight, especially for a product so heavily marketed by the design thinking that went into it, and I can't help but hope Amazon will put more thought into how people use and interact with their product when designing the experience of future generations of the kindle."
Allyson Yenerall,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish the battery were better. I specifically bought this product over a much cheaper fire product because of its supposed “weeks long” battery life. To be fair I read a lot but this device only lasts me about two days without a charge. I was expecting a lot more. It’s also frustrating coming from using the kindle app on my phone that this kindle specific product doesn’t have continuous scrolling, which is without a doubt my favorite aspect about the kindle app. Between those issues and the fact that since I bought the product a couple of days ago, it’s just now being offered for a lower student price (which wasn’t available before) I’m not too happy with my purchase."
L.Elmore,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love to read! I love to have a book with me! I waited far too long to buy a Kindle. I do like the feel of a paper book in my hands and will still continue to buy ""real"" books but having my little Kindle along in a small purse or bag is just an enhancement to enjoying my reading. It came with 12 books all ready to go and I purchased a three book package for $6.00 in my favorite mystery genre. I also purchased the cover and it is perfect to protect the Kindle in my purse. Now, I am ready to pack my hard cover paper backs or Kindle no matter where I go or what my carry space is."
Sean and Linda Trimm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My kindle was wrapped up in my bed sheets and I washed it! Warm water, Gain liquid soap, regular cycle. Was in a case. Had water pouring out the charging port. I freaked out. Put it in a ziplock bag with a bunch of those dry packs, the kind you get when you buy new shoes or a bag, only I actually buy them on Amazon for my photo collections. The kindle works! I have insurance on it but I don't even think I need to use it. Impressive.
Not impressed with the page turning, it's harder to turn the page with this Kindle than it was with my last one but well worth it if you're scatter-brained."
Tiro,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a big fan of ebooks and keep a stock of various ones collected from free libraries.
This is my first and last Kindle because:
- the device feels plastic cheap and the screen reaction time is not impressive at all
- no improvement visible to me compared to an eBook Reader from 8 years ago
- support for epub or most other formats is non existent so you have to convert them, which i find
very flimsy
- synchronization with your book library (if it's not on Amazon) via wlan is painfully clumsy
- battery life not as the vendor states but much less in particular with wlan on

Reading books with a first gen iPad is a so much more enjoyable experience - i will just stick to that."
John E. folsom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Kindle was a second generation 2009 version with built in keyboard at the bottom. However, it did not take me long to make the transition as many access functions and methods of use are the same. Only a few were different and took some practice such as switching from a button page turner to a touch screen page turner. I am very happy with this new model and hope it also lasts 10 years plus too. It is very nice and user friendly.

alpha89us,2.0 out of 5 stars,After owning the paperwhite for nearly a year. The battery fails to take a charge now. I was never really happy with the battery life. It seemed to need charging every week and a half. Even when the Kindle sat idle for any length of time. Luckily the battery failed two weeks before the one year dead line for replacement. Will see what happens when I contact customer support.
Natalie robello,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a 3rd generation kindle that i absolutely love but the batteries do not hold a charge. So i decided to buy the new paperwhite. I love it because it has backlighting, but what i do not like is that it is hard to hold because the edges around the screen do not give you much to hold on to. Besides that it is an awesome kindle.

Week 3- I am still getting used to the touch screen, but i have to say i much rather have my generation 3 in working order. I find i am turning pages when i am trying to reposition in bed, and because there are no page numbers, i find myself searching for the page i was at previously, pretty frustrating. I do love the backlighting, and i have set mine pretty low so i get sleepy as i read and not stimulate me. I wished they would have made the edges a bit wider so i can grip it better and not slip touching the screen and turn the page by accident."
k,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my Paperweight Kindle about three weeks ago. I love the fact that I can order a book online and in just minutes, its on my Kindle. And at a reduced price. The Kindle is a lot less weight than most books that I read. My only problem with my Kindle is that I haven't quite mastered all its features. I like the tap feature to turn a the page both forward and back. And the dictionary feature is a good add-0n, but I still haven quite got the use of it down. I can adjust the size of the font which is very handy. I'm glad I purchased this version of Kindle...and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle White - Had several issues for the past three weeks where Kindle White would shut off while I was reading it and then yesterday it on got stuck on ""opening up"". This KW is 5 months old. My old Kindle lasted over 5 years. hmmm."
YB,1.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Paperwhite stopped working after 2 weeks of use. Amazon guaranteed over the phone that they will send a new device and not a refurbished one. The box with a used device came in today with the label “refurbished”.
Partly Sunny,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the 10th Gen Kindle, and it has a stupid power button like so many previous versions. I can't remember which version had the GOOD bottom slide power button that doesn't turn on accidentally in your bag like mine (Voyage) does, but my husband has it, and I'm envious. I am forced to keep my Kindle in a case b/c the toggle power button is on the back and any time it bumps up against something, bam, it's ON!
My other issue with this NEW Kindle - is the super crappy resolution. I put them side by side, same brightness, w/ power, and my Kindle Voyage is WAY crisper and cleaner than this new piece of garbage. Was hoping to replace mine because of the power button issue - but it's worse and the screen is worse. Don't know how they managed to do that??!!"
J.P.U.,1.0 out of 5 stars,I traded in my other kindle for the new Kindle Paperwhite with the promised of 25% off or discount toward the purchase of new Kindle. My original Kindle E-reader was valued from $15 to final amount of $5 after it had been shipped and received by Amazon. They said it was not power on. It was in really very good condition but was not fully charged when I returned it. I have never heard of the promised gift card and anything discount on my account that I can use on my next order of whatever items I need. Very disappointed.
Suzanne G. Wills,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband and daughter are long time Kindle users. I decided to update them to the latest product features for Christmas. They loved their old Kindles but love these new ones more. They are so so much easier to hold and put into a backpack or purse. The back light for reading makes them usable in places they weren't before. They haven't has to use the fact they are waterproof yet but we both have pools and my daughter loves to read on the beach.
Librarylady,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older version of paperwhite, books downloaded instantly, the screen was brighter. This newer version is ok, but I have to search for the book or author when I download a book now. Doesnt automatically download onto my home screen. Usually, I have to restart the darn thing too, after searching and finding the book. It sure isnt an improved version and I am so very disappointed. If my other ereader hadn't met with an unfortunate demise, I would still be a happy camper. Altho i would recommend an ereader, i would say if you can get an older version. This newer version kind of stinks."
Brenda Wolfe,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the lighter weight of the device.

Hate the fact that it fires up with more marketing material than reading material. My old Paperwhite Home Page opened to a list of the books I had downloaded. Unless I intentionally went to the kindle store to shop, it allowed me to enjoy a reading experience. Now, I need to wade past ""recommendations"" to get to my books. Having paid in full for the device, it is incredibly tacky that the d**m thing continues to seek ways to make me spend more.

Had I been aware of this aspect of the new Paperwhite, I would have stayed with the one I had. (I was seduced by the waterproof feature ... should have resisted.)"
JudiMae,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the backlit screen that allows me to read without disturbing my husband with a lamp. Also, on a plane, much easier to see without regard for the relatively poor lighting there. The touch screen is very sensitive and completely different feel from my old click Kindle, so it’s taking me some time to get comfortable with that- I end up inadvertently touching the screen and changing the page, then can’t find where I was without some effort. But that is getting better with time. The battery is great! I read every day and have only charged twice since Christmas- nearly 6 weeks ago!"
assegai,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I spent hours downloading my Kindle library used my other kindle to read for 2 weeks & when it needed a recharge went to use my new paper white instead it opened I selected a book & the touchscreen wouldn't respond. At a 92% charge level. Went to try shutting it down & restarting & go to swipe to start reading, swiped - the screen flashed & went right back to swipe to start reading. Tech support said to de-register & try it after 5-10 minutes... Did that & NOTHING. In fairness, Amazon is shipping a replacement BUT that doesn't give me back the hours it took to download my books!"
Vicki LF,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first Kindle that has not been satisfactory--I've had five. My main problem is with the battery life. I've had it run down three times now when I have let it sit for a while without using. That never happened before unless I hadn't used my Kindle for a long time (which is very rare). I liked the light better on my last unit, also. The whole Kindle seems to be more unpleasant to use. I wish I hadn't traded my old unit in for this one because I would go back to using it. I guess I'm just stuck with it now. I'm just unhappy because I have loved every Kindle since they came out. I'm not used to being disappointed."
musiclover3,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, I had the original Kindle and it died so I bought this as a replacement specifically because it was waterproof and I like reading while I float in the pool. This product is not what I consider to be waterproof. Maybe water-resistant is what they mean. I’m reading the “Water Protection” section of the little pamphlet that came with it: “Your Kindle has been tested to withstand brief accidental immersion in water under certain conditions. However, your Kindle is not intended for underwater use and may experience temporary effects from exposure to water.” That’s not waterproof. I don’t intend to use it underwater but what if I drop it and it floats to the bottom of the pool?"
sarah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After 9 years, my original Kindle Touch finally died, I had it at the end of high school, had it all through college and many text books, and many beach trips and summers laying in the sun reading with it. It served me well, so it was time to upgrade. Not going to lie the main selling point is waterproof because my parents live on a lake and I want to float around and read, or I likely would have bought an old refurb touch model just like mine for cheap. The glare other people in reviews mention doesn’t seem bad, it was my main concern, seems similar to my old touch, just a little different because it’s face is entirely flat. I don’t have any pin holes on mine. And when I read people saying it came in a small box I didn’t realize it was really basically a nothing box! But looks like it made it safe. Hopefully this one will last me as long as my first. A big bonus for me was the case I was given with my original kindle wasn’t amazon branded, and it fits my new one just fine! So glad I didn’t spend money for another case. I’ll update as things may come up."
teufels,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In general, I like this-- it's my first kindle and the size is perfect. However it's a little laggy compared to a tablet, the pages sometimes seem to have an animation effect of shadow before revealing the next page, but I find it more irritating than reminiscent of a book. It can be a little slow to wake up, too, and apparently like lots of other people, i got a charging cable that didn't quite fit the dock on the kindle. The replacement works fine.

What I don't like is that it is still grayscale. Other kindle apps can show color, why not the kindle itself? If I had known this going in, I might not have committed right away. Waterproof is a nice touch, but color would be stellar."
Thomas Dragoon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Much better viewing screen than the 3rd Generation unit it replaces after battery failure. Miss the page forward tabs. Learning curve adapting to new unit but once you gain familiarity with it functions well. Be careful of the trade in process and discount credit allowance towards a new unit. Had to go through a third party to contact Amazon, discuss the problem, and then receive the claimed discount. It is NOT automatically given and once you place the order good luck at obtaining the offer as advertised once you push the ""Order"" key. Google ""Amazon Customer Service"" and you will find a third party source that does an excellent job of resolving Amazon Customer Service issues."
earl j reese,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like paperwhites. I liked my old one but the battery life wasn't great for an avid reader like me. The new one is some better. I like the idea that it is water resistant so I can read it in my hot tub or by the pool without concern. I thought the back light was supposed to be adjustable but if it is I can not find that feature. All in all I am not sure I got my money's worth by trading up but I am enjoying my 6 months free of unlimited. I gave the new PW 4* but could have goe with three.
Cheryl Robb,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I'd like to say that I loved my 6 year old Kindle. The best invention ever. I still read hardback books, but this little Kindle was game-changing for me. The only reason I asked for the new one is mine was freezing a lot taking too much time to turn the pages and since I read in the tub (!!) always worried about dropping it. The new one is even better. It's definitely lighter, and may I say way waaaaay faster! The downloads complete in fractions of seconds. The pages turn ever so quickly and the display top is smooth with no raised edge. I didn't think that this product could get better, but it did. I'm still keeping my old Kindle because it still works and my kids can use it for travel. Thanks ever so much for creating such a great product and updating it to make it even better."
angela,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was bought on my account in Nov 2019 on black friday deals for a Christmas present. After this was gifted we wanted to add the accidental insurance. I called Amazon the first person after an 40 min call told me how to add the insurance. then hung up. as I tried to add the insurance it said only if I bought within the last 30 days. I called back was transferred 4 times finally was told I can add it and if I need to use the insurance and they refused to let me use it, Due to the fact I added it after the 30 days of this being bought, They would tried and refund me the 30.00"
3catz24,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like having a touch screen and the promise of waterproofing! I have had several Kindles since 2010. Each newer one was better than the last but... This Kindle is not as easy as my last Kindle. My last had a speaker built in and was able to use text to speech independently. I could take it outside and work in the flower bed. This one requires a speaker! Yuk! Luckily I have an Echo Dot or couldn’t use in while doing other activities. It does allow a better volume control with Dot! But, Dot would read Kindle books without my Kindle. I am looking forward to using this feature in my car’s Bluetooth. I will update after use in the car."
Colin B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am on my 5th kindle...only because I have lost them or shared them with family and friends. I LOVE this new blue color!! I have loved the Paperwhite since it came out so that I can read OUTDOORS!!! and I am happy to pay extra for the waterproof feature since I was with my mom when she dropped hers into the water while reading and standing on the edge of tropical waves. This is an amazing product which allows you to easily enjoy reading anywhere so it is great to have it be more resilient! BUT it is time for a redesign to MOVE THE POWER BUTTON!!! I recently used my daughters older Kindle version and was reminded that the power button used to be in the top RIGHT corner (like an iPad). It is now on the bottom edge so that everytime I stand it up to read hands free, IT TURNS OFF!! I would buy a whole new one if you would just MOVE THE POWER BUTTON!!"
Becky Lewis Thompson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally started using this to listen to audible books, and repeatedly had trouble pairing earphones. Ordered 3 sets, and it wouldn't ""forget"" the one I wanted to eliminate. I was able, after struggling, to listen to 1 and a half books, and now the screen is frozen in ""waking up"" mode. I cannot turn it on, or off. Now I've lost the books that I bought for the Kindle. NOT amused."
Lisa,2.0 out of 5 stars,"i hate that the book does not have the name of the book on the top of each page. If you somehow lose the book (the library returns it at midnight!) you have to remember the exact name of the book to re download it! I don’t bu many books, just borrow them from my local library. So if I download 6 Jack Reacher books, I have no clue which book I’m reading, i know. write it down somewhere, but surely Kindle could print the name of the book at the top of the page!"
Kellie,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After having the Original Kindle for 9 years, this new PaperWhite is hard to get used to. The set up is much different and a bit more difficult to maneuver around. The screen is very touchy, the set up for your library is more difficult to locate if you have or have not already read the book. It is very small compared to the original, but it is because the keyboard is within the screen rather than a separate bar of the unit. My most important thing for you to know is that I ordered this and received it promptly, got it set up and within the first 2 weeks I opened it to read my current book and it froze up on me!! I could not do a reset or even shut off and holding the on/off/reset button for a bit, caused a dark black line vertically on the screen. Had to return to exchange and when I asked the HelpDesk gal I spoke to if this was a ""common thing"" with the new PaperWhite and her answer was ""I cannot say that"". This means to tell me it is - be cautious!"
buzz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Dont wanna give this a good or bad review because really cant use it. Got the kindle unlimited plan with this for my son on Christmas & soon as he opened it not one of the books he searched for was free. Every single one was between $4-$11. Yeah there is a whole lot of books for free but for a 13 yr old boy there isn't much he can find unless he's settling & the kindle plus the unlimited subscription is to costly to settle. Was really hoping this would work but now have to return it. I suggest searching through the free books b4 making the purchase so not to go through what I am
Michele Cross,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my kindle. The only thing I would like changed is the location of the on/off button. It is on the bottom, & I have to be careful not to bump it while reading b/c it turns off. It needs to be located on top, similar to an iPad. This is a minor issue. I love the convenience of being able to download books from the local library or from kindle membership. I’ve read more books in the past 4 months than ever."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this thinking I was replacing a 2015 Paperwhite when I was actually replacing a 2015 Voyager. It made me grumpy. Some of that is because of the lower content and quality level of the Paperwhite vs the Voyager, and some of that is design choices for the Paperwhite (given its cost constraints) that just seem non-ideal.

1) My most comfortable position for holding it puts my pinkie finger right on the power button. I’ve only had the thing 12 hours and already accidentally shut it off mid-read several times. (This was NEVER a problem before.). Edited to add: a brilliant friend pointed out that I could hold the thing upside down to read so that the button would be on top, away from my hand. This would be great if it worked, but the screen doesn’t seem to flip on the Paperwhite.
2) For some reason, I now have to choose between seeing only my collections (without knowing which books are unsorted into collections) or all my collections and all my (70 pages of) books, which makes finding and sorting stuff much much harder. (Before a book was either in a collection, or unsorted and visible outside the collections. Much much more useful.)
3) The Voyager has hardware buttons with tactile feedback, the Paperwhite has only screen touches to navigate. I miss the hardware.
4) There is no way to tap to move both forward and backward with a single hand (as I now realize I did ALL THE TIME on my Voyager). You can swipe back, which would be okay except...
5) The screen is under-responsive to swipes (which was also the case on the Voyager, but it mattered less because of both the hardware buttons and the better screen touch navigation zones).
6) I loved the feature on my old Voyager where the brightness auto-audjusted to the ambient light (nice and bright outside on a sunny day, dimmed to a peaceful level in bed at night). That’s not on the Paperwhite. I miss it.
7) Overall the thing feels cheaper and less nice than the Voyager. Which is maybe not surprising - it does cost less than the Voyager. But I wish my Voyager hadn’t died an ignominious death of screen lines and cycling power. Or that Amazon hadn’t killed the Voyager (presumably in favor of the Oasis, which costs $50 more than the Voyager did)."
lancerev08,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded my paperwhite to the latest mostly for the flush screen. I also like how it is thinner and smaller than the previous generation. And I was hoping with better specs and software, this new one would be snappier and more responsive.

However, the performance is about the same. There's a lag with every gesture you make, just like previous versions.

The most disappointing thing is that the text is blurrier on this version than the previous. I think it is because of the screen. The flush screen is a different material from previous generations, and it blurs the text more than the old material.

I hope the next iteration addresses this and provides clearer text. (FYI, I had the old and new Kindle next to each other with exactly the same fonts/sizes/boldness/brightness/etc. The new one is definitely blurrier.)"
CF22,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not like to leave negative reviews, but I was very disappointed with my purchase. I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite 8gb 10th generation.
I was able to download my existing Kindle library, including my audiobooks. The home page showed my book covers in a really grainy light grey color making it hard to read some of the titles. Everytime I swiped to the next page of my library the kindle flashes and the the page reloads. I started reading a book and ended up bumping the off button on the bottom a few times. It takes a bit for the sleep screen to open everytime you bump it. You also cannot rest it in your treadmill book rack because it rests on the off button.
It has no headphone jack so I would need to carry around my large bluetooth hadphones if I wanted to listen to a book. I did not try to listen to an audiobook, but other reviews stated it is only compatible with audible books.
If you want to read at night you need to manually turn down the brightness.
You also have to buy a separate charging jack as it only provides the micro usb cord. I am returning my kindle and may lookinto buying a prior gen as they have better reviews.
I really wanted to love it and I love Amazon, but I was disappointed in the quality of graphics, strange flashing and reloading and lack personalization."
Lauren Rose,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm so in love with this product. I've been an avid reader all my life but it has become painful for me. Holding a trade paperback or hardback hurts my hands. Also, In my dotage, my eyesight isn't what it used to be. The night I got my e-reader I read a book and I've been reading like mad ever since. It is comfortable to hold and I love the resolution. I've ordered a blue tooth speaker, which I'm supposed to get today, which will add another dimension to my reading enjoyment."
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was very disappointed. The battery lasted 48 hours on a full charge. I sent it back
Clarinetist,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had a number of Kindles and find this one to be on par with the others. I do think it has a number of improvements: access to settings is easier, not as heavy, waterproof...

I find the battery lasts just as long, if not longer; however, I don't listen to audiobooks.

The two drawbacks for me: The light doesn't turn down as low as in previous versions and at its lowest is brighter than I would like at night; and when you first turn it on, the light is like a flashlight until it turns down to your setting. I literally turn the Kindle away from me when I first open it at night. What the heck Amazon?"
judyannemt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought I'd prefer an e-book reader over an actual book, but I do. Usually, the only time I get a chance to read is when I'm in bed. With a real book, I'd fall asleep and the book would fall, losing my place. That doesn't happen with the Kindle. Also, I have a whole library full of books at my disposal, in one small device. As far as the Kindle Paperwhite listed here, I take it with me when I go out of town every other week. I have an Oasis at home, which I love, but my husband built a stand for me on my bed, and it's a pain to get the Oasis out every other week, so I bought this. I wish this had the page turning buttons, like the Oasis, but touching the page works, too."
Pete,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m really enjoying my kindle. I really like the minimalist feel and weight, very easy to travel with and love the non glare display because I am outside often.
My only complaint is my understanding was that you could get a week on one charge (I’m sure this is under ideal conditions but I’m finding myself charging every 2-3 days. In this case I would have just stuck with using my iPad which is about how often I charge it."
B. Schrader,4.0 out of 5 stars,Unfortunately the new kindle has not impressed me. I find that I havee to swipe pages more than onceto get them to move. The biggest disappointment was the battery life. I had a previous version that is aprox 2 years old. I was finding hat I had to recharge more frequently as time moved on. I read in short sperts while waiting for traffic or waiting for an appointment. Then I read in extended time periods6-7 hours. I am having to charge daily. I am also concerned about always having to use the on button vs just opening the cover. Seems more annying at the present time. I still love my Kindle and read no less.
Erin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've seen a few reviews complaining about this products battery life, but I think we all need to remember it *IS* an electronic device. The more you use it in a day the shorter the battery life will be. I've had mine going on 7 weeks....and though I read at least an hour a day (5 or 6 hours on my days off) I've only had to charge my paperwhite 3 times. That's pretty decent in my mind. I love the convenience of having a device I can turn the background light on and off on. When I don't need the light I don't use it. When I do I've not found it necessary to go above 10 on the lighting scale. If I were to suggest anything, it would be to maybe have a feature where the light only comes on from like 10pm to 6am. That way we as consumers do not forget to turn off the light. :D"
Iron Mans Mom,2.0 out of 5 stars,I thought I would love this device with my addiction to the written and spoken word. But the power button placement is stupid and I gave up on the device after the last time I inadvertently shut the device off while I was reading. I should have returned it as it’s gathering dust on my bedside table on top of the Kindle 10. I’m still reading and listening on my iPhone. Which I wanted to stop with the purchase of the Kindles. Literally I gave away two iPads for Kindles. I learned my lesson. I just hate it was a four hundred dollar course!
Marge hislop,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read a lot and it’s great that I can fit my kindle into my purse. It’s always there ready for me to read when I have to wait at the doctors office, when I go to the restaurant on my own, even just sitting in my car with a cup of coffee. With the extra room in my memory I can download as many books as I want and the ability to adjust the backlight is really helpful. I haven’t been able to read a hardbound book for years due to my limited vision, so thank you for providing a book I can enlarge the print to whatever is most comfortable. In short, my Kindle my constant companion and I love it."
SandyR,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is my fifth kindle (3rd paper white). Obviously I am a fan. I read at least a couple hours a day. When I close the case it stays on so unless I remember to shut it off with the button the battery is dead when I get back to reading. When I push on it says waking up and that takes a minute. Cumbersome This version seems slower. Do like the lighter weight. I always expect the newer version to enhance my experience. This didn’t do it
Alec M,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the size and weight of new paperweight. I did appreciate reading with it near water without worrying. The audio portion is neat but I found myself still using my air pods to listen to audiobooks on my iPhone. I think the touch screen isn’t as responsive as it could be. The paper white is meant for its case it’s house it turns off and on it sleeps rather easier otherwise power button to wake before swiping up. Browsing for books is easier on kindle app on iOS so I usually look that way then ad book to collection before finding it with enough swipes in my paper white I’ll not likely buy another one. For I can get a better experience from an iPad mini
Brenda TN,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very dissatisfied with the new Kindle paper white. Mine would overheat if I sat out by the pool yet it advertises that is waterproof and great for the pool. My older paperwhite never had this problem and I read outside all the time. I talked to Amazon and they told me to send it in. I have had it 6 months and it is under warranty. I sent it in and went without it for a couple of weeks. They said they fixed it and returned it. I went out and was outside reading maybe 30 minutes and got the warning again. I called Amazon and they are sending me a new one. But they are sending a refurbished one. So it will be an used Kindle. I think they should have replaced the defective with a new one. Very unhappy with the situation
Vespero,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Updating from my first-gen Paperwhite, I found this to be very nice. The flat screen is wonderful and gets rid of the issue I had with dirt getting between the screen and casing with my old one.

However, there are some downsides which are shameful in this day and age. First of all, it's still Micro USB rather than USB-C, which seems bizarrely archaic given its release date and the ease of the new standard. This means, when travelling, I have to bring another cord specifically for it. Secondly, I don't buy my books through Amazon, and for some reason Amazon refuses to remember Collections for books that are transferred to the device via USB. For some reason, if you use their email system (which is terribly slow, especially when dealing with large numbers of books) they'll let you keep your Collections, but otherwise they don't track them AND they notify you that they're not tracking them whenever you mess with them. The least they could do is make Collections editable by third-party programs, or include a method of organizing books via the computer. The ability to look-up 3rd party ebooks on Goodreads would be great.

My last complaint (and this is relatively minor) is that when waking up, the device turns on its back-light very brightly before adjusting down to my personal settings (which I keep rather low). This has the tendency of making my screen seem too-dim for a while until my eyes re-adjust to it."
Alisia,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really loved my third generation kindle and was so disappointed when it broke a few months ago. I got this on the Black Friday sale after reading some of the reviews I was nervous I wasn’t going to love it as much. But I do! It’s amazing. A good sized fit in my hands. The case I got with it is beautiful. I love that it is compatible with audible however there’s no speaker on the device and no headphone jack so you have to use Bluetooth headphones or a Bluetooth speaker. I do wish there was a speaker since I have little kids and I don’t normally use my BT headphones when they are awake during the day but using my BT speaker with it has been working just fine.
The Corfu,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Kindle as a gift. Generally, it is good and performs well. However, the included micro USB cable won't fit in the Kindle to charge it. The cable can only physically fit in one way. I didn't want to exert too much force on it and break the Kindle but the Amazon supplied cable won't fit. Fortunately, I had an Anker micro USB cable. It works fine.

Amazon contacted me and sent a replacement cable at no charge. The new cable works fine. The cable has been the only problem I have encountered."
Chad,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got a kindle fire tablet and frankly I hate it (but that's a different review). It left me wanting something better to read on. I used my phone for a while but that didn't work well either. The other day the Kindle Paperwhite was on sale so I couldn't resist. This device is light, just the right size, the screen is great to read on. The only minor complaint I have is that the device doesn't seem to have page curl. I know that's a little thing but it's a nice little feature that makes it feel more like reading a book. That's pretty much my only complaint and that might get fixed with some future update of the software. I don't do audio books but if you do this requires you to hook it up to an external bluetooth speaker."
Margie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the Paperwhite over the Kindle Fire, but I have a few issues with it. It is a little sensitive (?) or choppy to the touch. I don't understand why it blinks to a black screen with white type every time I turn a page. At times I have wanted to back up to reread something, but the pages don't want to turn smoothly and I end up at some place I didn't want to go. I'm not sure if it is defective or not? Does anyone have any tips for me?

I do SO love how small and light it is. I can't wait to sit outside with it and read with no glare! I live in a colder climate, so I look forward to the warmer weather."
NYC Shopper,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This piece of technology has turned into a regular annoyance. I just want to read my book - I turn on this Kindle, and it gives me 3 absurd choices: cancel.....restart....or close. Not mutually exclusive, and no, I don't want to do ANY of those. I just want to read. You have to choose one of them, and regardless of which you choose it goes into an infuriating loop of turning off...…….then turning on...….then off again...…..and back on again...…...and it finally stays on....then it goes off again. This can last for 10-15 mins. What an annoying, frustrating, badly designed or manufactured piece of uselessness."
James F. Policke,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This generation is not really a great step forward in Kindle evolution. It claims to be waterproof which I don’t intend to test. The enlarged memory isn’t much of an improvement unless you expect to be out of WiFi range for an extended period. The “Waking up” lag upon startup is new and slightly annoying. It fits in my Gen 3 paperwhite case, but no longer has the neat magnetic activate-on-open feature that my Gen 3 had. This would be less of an issue if the power button wasn’t microscopic and hard to find in the dark. The screen contrast doesn’t seem as high. If Amazon had been able to re-synch my Gen 3 properly I’d still be using it, especially after trying this new one."
somanybookssolittletime,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a major issue with connecting to the device via Bluetooth. I have paired my Apple AirPods with the device and every time I pick up my kindle to read again it sees the AirPods as the Bluetooth device but repeatedly says try again or make sure the AirPods are in range, When I literally have them in my ears while holding the kindle. This connectivity issue has certainly been my biggest frustration with the device. If I listen to the book from the kindle app on my phone I can follow along on screen. However, when listening from the kindle I can not. I plan to call about the issue with the Bluetooth because every single time it says Bluetooth connection failed and after 10 minutes of trying to connect I finally go through forget this device and re-pair the device and finally it will connect but this is insane to have to do this every single day. I’ve never had this type issue with any other device. The battery life is pretty good as stated. I don’t care very much for the light because I prefer the screen to look like paper not a lighted display. Overall I am disappointed about the Bluetooth being so frustrating every single day. I’m not sure if I have a defective device or if this is an issue with all kindles of this version."
LowellChief,3.0 out of 5 stars,"While far better than my previous paperwhite, the battery is ""ok"". But I have only had it for a week or so. Ask me again in 2 months."
Samantha,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered the new Kindle, as my Kindle 2 (9 years old) just recently bit the dust. I was very excited about this new one being waterproof and having a backlight. I recieved it the day it was released and have already read several books. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because it arrived with a small defect. There is a small spot on the bottom of the screen that looks like there are missing pixels and the backlight shines through majorly. It’s small and I’m the bottom corner so I decided not to return the Kindle at the time since I was so anxious to start reading again. There is that defect though so can only give 4 stars. Attaching picture."
Debra,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always have loved my Kindle and really did not need an upgrade. BUT glad I decided to go for it. It's brighter. Easier to read with more font selections. I just seem to be enjoying it more. Doesn't exactly fit into the case I already owned and loved. The solution was easy - just sharing - put a piece of cardboard into the holder first. Cause the new Kindle is slightly thinner then the old.
Worked well - holds everything in place. When I travel I'll just carry it cause it is lighter then the older versions.
love it"
S. Adamak,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got my device yesterday, so at this point, all is working well. setup was easy. I upgraded from like a Gen5 kindle to this, so the upgrades are NICE! I like the layout of the menus and the screens - my other kindle was very basic and not so intuitive. the battery life - we will see how it goes. it came with a 50% charge, and I charged it up to 100%. after about an hour or so of playing around with it, it was down to 89%. I keep the Bluetooth OFF to save battery. and usually the light I have set lower to reduce eye strain.
so far so good! i'm liking this generation of kindle :)"
StacyT,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best investment I’ve ever made. I’m an avid reader and this works so well. The lighting is always perfect whether I’m reading in daylight or at night. It is much more lightweight than my tablet too. I don’t agree with the battery lasting for “weeks.” On the weekend I usually read for a solid 6-8 hours. It lasts about 3 days. Longer if I read less. If you take it on vacation, definitely take your charger. Everything else is fantastic. The screen is really crisp. The only other thing I could wish for is a colored screen so I could fully appreciate the book covers."
RBY,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First: I like the P.W and recommend it! But ... I have had one or more updates a week and that off/login button location absolutely is in a poor location. It is so sensitive that just holding it in your right hand with you pinky at the bottom will cause it to ask you if you want to reboot and if you take you eyes off the screen - bam, a reboot. The older non P.W. had much longer lasting battery. Button on top would be better."
Anne Higgins,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Paperwhite replaces a Paperwhite I bought exactly one year ago. I gave that one to a friend. This one is so much better. The touchscreen is more responsive, lighting in it is a better technology than my last one, and the page turns/changes are faster. Again, this is a much better Paperwhite than the one I had bought exactly one year ago! The battery life is A LOT longer. I use my Paperwhite every day for at least three or four hours."
S N,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just been using the kindle for 3 days and have not had any trouble using it. Looking forward to using the extra memory as I have a large library of kindle books and I do enjoy rereading my favorites.
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used many Kindle and Fire readers and this new Paperwhite is the best yet as a pure reader. It doesn't have the internet functions of the Fire, but as a text reader it surpasses all previous Kindle readers. The battery life is good giving over a week of usage with heavy reading. It may be just my eyes, but I find the screen easier on the eyes then a Fire or any other tablet. Also the available fonts, page presentation and other adjustments are excellent. The only drawback is the Paperwhite does not offer page the scrolling function of the Fire. However the page turning is easily accomplished. As a book or magazine reader the Paperwhite is unequaled"
Eric St. Onge,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's nice that this Kindle is waterproof, but overall I think this Paperwhite is worse than my previous 2016 version:
1. The battery life is very bad. I need to charge this one every week.
2. The power button is in the wrong place. I accidentally hit it on a daily basis and turn the device off while I am reading. I am right handed and the power button is on the bottom right, precisely where you hold it with your right hand. I'd like to think this is bad industrial design and not a nefarious attempt to get me to buy a case?
3. It takes a long time to wake from sleep.

Also, it remains irritating that the Kindle can't set its time automatically.

Still, I use this Kindle to read 1-2 books per week, so it's not so bad. If a newer one comes out with the power button in a usable location I would probably get that instead, because OMG this device is irritating to use."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This replaces the Kindle Keyboard that I had for 10 years. I loved my old Kindle, which works perfectly but my son insisted on buying me a new one. I am still getting used to it. I love my new magnetic case that goes on and off when I open it.
I am still trying to find my books that I have on my other devices. It is comfortable to hold and read. The print can be adjusted to my liking. I have not used it yet in the sunlight but I have used it in the dark. I usually read on my Kindle Fire when it's dark. This is a little easier on my eyes. I love all my Kindle devices."
SparkleChick,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had to return the Kindle after one day because it was defective. It would not load properly and the page turning was very slow. At times the text would pixelate to the point that it was hard to know what letter it was supposed to be. Disappointed.
Anzara,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was THE hardcore ""old school"" reader. Had to get the book at the bookstore, smell the paper, crack the spine and settle in with a new book. I was NEVER going to an E reader! Until.... I tried it, loved it, got my own for Christmas! I love how light it is, how I can look at all kinds of books at my fingertips, how I can stick it in my purse and how I can take ALL of my favorite books with me when I go away. I used to take 5 or 6 books on vacation, because...you never know- it might rain, i might not like the first book etc etc etc. Now, that is one less thing to worry about when packing! Other reviews comment on technical stuff and complain av3oit speed and this or that. I dont care about nit pickin it apart. It does what they said it was going to do. And from someone that had to feel the book in her hands to make it real- that is a huge endorsement."
Beej13,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love that this one is waterproof. Haven’t tried dunking it, but it has been splashed with no issues. Size is good. Battery life seems fine. I have trouble reading paper books now. They feel so clunky compared to a Kindle. And I love that between my Kindle Unlimited account and online library, I have a huge book selection for my mom and I for minimal cost.

This is my third Kindle, and my first two still work fine, including the older version 2 Kindle. I upgrade to get the newer features and the Kindles are priced so reasonably I can upgrade without feeling guilty."
Kathleen,4.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t regret this purchase. I have always loved Kindle since it’s still the best bet for reading outside. Love the back lighting. It is faster and holds more books than my old Kindle. However- the battery life sucks. it’s my only disappointment. My old Kindle lasted for weeks on a charge. This model was supposed to be even better. It’s not. A little better when I turn off wireless but that’s a pain and didn’t matter with my old Kindle. This is something I hope Amazon fixes. I have seen other reviews commenting on this and they were correct. It’s not a deal breaker but inconvenient and NOT as advertised.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new Kindle. It is smaller, lighter and I especially like the back light. My old Kindle from 2011 still works great, but I wanted a built-in light so when we are camping in the evening I can still read without have to try to clip on a book light. While technically, the battery does last weeks, meaning a couple weeks, it doesn't last as long as it seemed by the advertisements. However, it charges quickly, so not a real deal breaker for me."
Jim Thompson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This new kindle is great for reading. Small and very good screen which makes it very portable and easy on the eyes.
I look at computer screens all day, so the kindle is great for reading electronic books without bothering my eyes the way a computer screen does.
Amazon books are downloaded automatically after purchase which is very convenient.
The touch screen doesn’t always respond the same each time, but I think that is a body temperature issues.
I highly recommend this for avid readers not wanting to carry books around, or read on a computer screen!"
Ian R.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Im not giving it 5 stars:
You cant control what the screensaver is. It should be the cover of the book your reading.
Why not 4:
The form factor is not perfect at all. The edge of the device is large, but it needs to be because if it wasnt youd false-tap it even more often. And it already happens too much. The device also is generally not that sensitive and constantly mistakes a back press for a forward press. One mistaken tap and it takes a lot to get back to where you were.
The battery life is good, but for what it is, it could have been better.
It is nice that amazon gives you an email address you can send books to, and that they appear on all devices with the kindle app too, but that has nothing to do with this device specifically."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon offered a very persuasive deal to turn in my previous Kindle Paperwhite for this one. I wanted to listen to Audiobooks and my old version did not have that capacity. I don't think I would do this again. I lost some of the features like the controls on either side to click through pages. The lighting of the screen is not as good as the screen on my older version. I feel that I gave up more in the way of READING, than I gained for Audio. If I had it to do over, I'd simply buy a different device to listen to audiobooks and kept the older version of my Kindle."
NtnKtn,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a bit disappointed in the new Paperwhite. After having used a Fire for a few years I got used to the color screens and the easy touch screen. The Paperwhite is a dull black and white and it is really tiresome to try to get from the book you are reading to the main menu. Even after finishing a book, i am frustrated trying to get back to that main menu. Each time I get to a new chapter, the page sort of flashes - irritating.
The good things are that the battery life is excellent. I only charge it up once every 10 days or so. And the memory capacity is excellent."
John H. Howe,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for my wife as her 5-year-old Kindle died. Everything was fine until one night she goes to read and the Kindle was locked up. Finally got it up and running after forcing a reboot. This has now happened over 5 times. After the second time, I called support. The support person really didn't understand what I was telling her and told me to continue using and see if it continues to lock up. Poor support. First time with Amazon."
T'Leah McQuade,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have never had a paperwhite and are thinking of one:
It is a solid ereader for those who are serious about their reading and want an ereader that isn't trying to be a tablet. Any version of the paperwhite is great. I have a Fire also, but it doesn't compare to reading on the paperwhite.

If you have an older version, the changes are negligible. Upgrade if you need more space, are scared of dropping the kindle in the tub, or damaged the old one. The old paperwhite was great. And this one is great. I transitioned with no issues other than a negligible yet annoying lag time when opening it. But a case solved that, it auto opens the kindle when you open the cover."
Lynn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of my coworkers received one for Mother's day and showed me how cool it was, so, I ordered one for myself. I was using my phone, 10"" tablet or 17"" laptop to read from. I am so happy with this little thing!!! It took me a minute to ""adjust"" to a smaller screen like that, but, with the cover I got for it and the non-glare of the screen.....I am addicted to my little Kindle!! Don't even get me started with the battery life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AMAZING!!! I can't wait to bring it to the beach on my girl's trip. I couldn't read out there because of the glare, but, I will be able to now....AND....all day long too! Thank you, Kindle!!"
Steve B.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this kindle paperwhite to upgrade my previous keyboard kindle. I also have a Kindle fire which I love but not good to read in the sunlight. This is a very good Kindle for daylight reading and night time back lit reading. The voice command will drive you crazy. It is a useless frustrating feature. This kindle will not voice read regular Kindle books... I called to ask because it seemed so dumb that it did not because it certainly could have the capability. A lot of my books are not ""Audible"". This device will only read ""Audible"" books. That is a marketing choice by Amazon.... BUY MORE AUDIBLES. At least they did not take away my keyboard Kindle to upgrade and I can still use it."
Marilyn A. Lagier,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift from a friend. While I'm happy to get it, I found it just as un-user-friendly as my first Kindle. I had to live chat help to get stuff transferred and to get it so that I could access books I was already reading. I wish Kindle would make the on/off button more user-friendly. I appreciate being able to read in the dark--which I couldn't do with my old Kindle. But, why do they automatically expect that a new Kindle user will just ""pick it up"" and get right into reading, downloading, etc. It's really not that easy--even with the instructions on the Kindle--which isn't real helpful if you are trying to go back/forth on something. I'm not stupid regarding technology, I just think Kindle isn't as easy as it really could be."
bobgob,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the previous version of the Paperwhite and like it quite a bit. It is vastly superior to my iphone for reading outside. I bought the new waterproof version because it can do white text on a black background (needed for reading in bed). The white isn't white and black isn't black but it is serviceable. What is a PITA is switching between black/white and white/black. On the iOS kindle app, it is simple. You just hit the Font icon and choose White, Black. But on the Paperwhite, you need to go into Settings > All Settings > Accessibility > Invert Black and White, and then hit the back button twice. It is annoying. I wish there was a way to suggest improvements to Amazon besides writing reviews."
Kevin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This was bought because I like reading in the pool. I have a 2017 paper white that i use to put in ax waterproof bag. So far the waterproof is working, i don't submerge it but it gets plenty wet. Battery life is fantastic 4x better than my old one. Fonts don't seem as crisp though. Backlight front light works but i still prefer reading without built in light. I think my eyes don't get as tired. Fits my old case. Still don't like the power button on the bottom, I hold books from the bottom and end up powering it off of not careful. Would really like this to be white the black has warned me itis getting hot and will shut down. I think the white world be less likely to absorb the Georgia sun."
Villain,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m a long-time Kindle user and this one is by far my favorite!

Pros:
- Very lightweight! Doesn’t weigh down my purse
- Great backlight
- Touch screen is easy to use
- Recommended Amazon branded case (fabric) fits perfectly and is very sturdy.

Cons:
- So lightweight that I often have to double check my purse to make sure it’s actually in there, and have more than one freak-out moment when I thought I had left it somewhere but it was actually in my purse. Is this really a con?
- Menus require a few more touches/taps to do common functions like adjust font or brightness compared to the previous Paperwhite. It’s almost trying to hard to be a tablet instead of a dedicated e-reader."
Shawn G. Jackson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Been very happy with my 2012 kindle so I bought the new waterproof paper white model.

Amazon's customer service have been fantastic and dealt with my key concerns.

When reviewing answers that the kindle paper white waterproof screen merely turns off and not necessarily the wifi or the kindle unit itself I was quite upset. My older kindle was intuitive and easy to ensure wifi and the unit were off. After speaking with customer service it appears you have to switch the unit to ""Aeroplane mode"" to turn wifi off and that when the screen is off the unit is off (though still not 100% convinced of this).

I believe the home screen fails a basic design tenet with too much info jammed in and you can't customise this screen - it was cleaner previously.

Hopefully this will last a good 7 years with no hassles like my previous unit."
Richard,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had it less then a month, and it won’t connect to WiFi. I called customer support and he told me I would be sent a new kindle and I would receive an Email to send my kindle back. So about four days later I continued to look for my Email. Never got it! So I had to look on my amazon purchases to find I have to send my kindle back to get repaired. So this hole time I’ve bin waiting for my new kindle and Email not knowing I had to send mine back and wait ten days. I enjoyed reading on it but the power button is on the bottom where I put my hand or rest it on my lap and it shuts off every time."
Wes Marshall,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon describes it as ""Kindle Paperwhite – Now Waterproof with 2x the Storage – Includes Special Offers.""

They define '""special offers"" differently than I would. Amazon's special offer is that you have the opportunity to open every session with an advertisement. Granted, it is an offer at a reduced price, but I have never had even the slightest interest in what's on offer. When I called Amazon and told them they could keep their special offer, they said thank you very much, that will be $10. A special offer that you have to pay to get rid of? Hardly special in my world."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a lot of pdf books to read. Attracted by the ideas of paperless reading and the convenience of being able to carry them all at once whenever you go, I bought this Kindle. This is the very first e-Ink device that I've ever owned.
But to my big displeasure, this Kindle Paperwhite is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT !! First, it's so annoyingly laggy !! This is especially troublesome when you want to fine tune the zoom. So, it will always ALWAYS zoom between too much and not enough !!! You can never zoom it just right, this is extremely annoying (well, it is not entirely the lagginess to blame, it also has to do with the fact that the zoom comes about in steps rather than in a continuous manner) !! Second, it can't reflush/realign the text to fit the screen, and it is the BIGGEST DOWNSIDE of this device ! ! ! ! So, when the font is too small and the paragraph width is too wide, after you zoom in, you'll have to keep swiping left and right repeatedly in order to read each single sentence. This is extremely frustrating ! ! ! ! Even my phone's pdf reader can reflush the text to fit the screen, why can't this dedicated reading device ? ? ? ? ! ! !

So, in all sincerity, I will advise any one who has never own a Kindle before against buying it. You simply cannot enjoy reading with it !!! It's totally contrary to what you imagine about this being able to read more and enjoy paperless reading. Now illusion shattered, I guess I will have to revert to printing things out on paper...

Pros: 1) Battery last for very long time; no need to recharge for weeks (probably also because I don't use it much ---- yes, it's that frustrating!!!). 2) Size very handy and light-weight.

Cons: 1) Annoyingly laggy. 2) Zoom in steps rather than continuously, you always end up having too large or not large enough fonts. 3) Can't reflush text to fit the screen. 4) Screen too small and too short (length-width ratio awkward, so unlike ordinary paper books). 5) The system interface is not convenient at all. When you want to adjust sth, it's a hard to find the right place to do so. 6) Charger not included.

Conclusion: NOT AT ALL recommended."
Amazonwoman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far everything is good. Nice screen as usual.
Can’t connect it to my car though for listening to books 🤔
I got a screen protector because the screen is now a full screen and don’t want it to scratch. Now it has a little bit of s glare but nothing to bad. Still 1000 times better than trying to read on my phone or iPad. I love this thing!

****Update - Apparently like many other people I had an issue with the charging port. I contacted customer service - At first they sent me another charging cable to see if this would fix the issue... it did not.... so then I got back in contact with them again and they sent me a new one... it seems like this one is fixed. No issue with the port. The charger went right in on this one."
LisaP,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Received as a gift, and it is awesome! I have had a regular Kindle, which is great, but this is way better for reading while by the pool, or just outside or anywhere bright. And because it's just the Paperwhite display, the battery life is INSANE!!

PLUS, I am a huge fan of ridiculously long baths with a book and a beverage. Waterproof is an incredible upgrade.

100% recommend!"
Casey,2.0 out of 5 stars,Controls aren't very good. Battery life is horrible. I downgraded when I bought this. Loved the one I bought 3 years ago. Update: Amazon CS saw my review and called me! The CS rep was knowledgeable and very friendly and wanted to know what Amazon could do to help out. We walked thru some options and the battery life has drastically increased. Thanks Amazon!
Sara Zito,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Boo. I lost my old kindle paperwhite and bought this new one. The battery lasts about as long as my cell phone. I have to recharge everyday while reading a book. The color of the light on screen is too bright and blue tinted compared to my old paperwhite. It feels cheap and the screen itself is too shiny. Way more glare than the last generation model. Also, the start up is clunky and blinds you with a super bright blank screen before settling into the home screen. Do yourself a favor and buy the older generation paperwhite."
arby,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted an e reader for traveling, and also so I could take advantage of deals and sales on digital books. I really like the backlighting, and the waterproof-ness is good if I want to read at the gym.
The screen is great for my eyes in light or dark, it's that typical e reader screen that has almost zero glare, unless you angle it directly at the sun for some reason.
Feels very comfortable to hold, lightweight but feels solid, not cheap.
I don't have many books for it yet, but I'm keeping an eye out for sales, especially since the $5 credit expired already (I'm of the opinion that it shouldn't expire at all, which is where that 5th star went."
A. Dong,3.0 out of 5 stars,"THis is my 3rd Kindle. Prior one was the Voyage. First of all, Amazon says this is the latest paperwhite - HOWEVER, there are 2 different models 2018 and 2019. While I thought I was getting the latest, I got one from 2018. There is a physical size difference between 2018 and 2019 - so make sure you check the model # on the back and carefully check descriptions on the non-Amazon kindle covers. Otherwise, I haven't notice much difference between this newer version vs prior version. I'm very glad I bought as a Black Friday promotion + trade-in because otherwise, I wouldn't think it was worth the price without those discounts vs just keeping the old one."
Claire Christopher,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really enjoy this new Kindle, considerably more than the previous versions. I like the fact that the screen is flush with the body of the device, and it seems silly that such a small thing makes such a considerable difference but it really does change the reading experience.

Compared to other e-readers, such as the Nook, Amazon's device is considerably more responsive and processes much more quickly, HOWEVER: I don't like the screen. B&N's Nook somehow managed to put a screen on its e-reader that is very naturally resistant to fingerprints and smudges, which is essential for a device like this one that doesn't have buttons to turn the pages but instead requires touching the screen itself. I find that even with freshly-washed hands and wiping the device down with ""fingerprint resistant"" cleaner, I can still see fingerprints on it and even just a tiny one tends to bother me. If this Kindle had a screen that was better able to repel fingerprints and page-turn-smears, then this device would be as close to perfect as it can get.

So, long story short: I love this device for the way it feels in my hands and how quickly it opens books/downloads books/returns to the main screen (considerably faster than Nook), but the screen is very easy to mark with prints/dust."
Karen S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have trouble with small print and gray screens - while this paperwhite is nothing like a cell phone screen, the print can be made darker (bold) and it can be made larger really easy - with the pinching method - or in the tools. It found all my documents, which I really love - since mine is used mostly as a 'resource' library. My books came through beautifully also. I will say that it takes a bit of getting used to from the original Kindle Fire. I think I had the very first Kindle Fire - so it took some getting used to that it was simply black and white. But as for size and weight, this is perfect for your purse or pocket. Since I only received this yesterday, I will return for an update later."
Deane,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an early adopter, since 2007, and this is my fourth one. It's the best one for weight, but it has a couple of glitches I'm not liking. There's a long pause for ""waking up"" upon opening the cover, every other one I've had comes on nearly immediately. The screen doesn't go dark enough for night reading and that causes eye strain. I'm having trouble accessing my Library. I assumed all my books were resident on the new Kindle, but only the list is available; each book or sample I want to open has to be re-downloaded individually. That means I have to be in a wifi zone to open a new book. Not sure if I'm keeping it..."
De,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been Kindle (I love my Kindle) owner for a very long time. I STRONGLY, STRONGLY dislike and get pissed off about is-many book/games/programs that I 'I've paid for & have information on (Notepad) are nor transferable from one Kindle to same kind of Kindle, just a newer version. Why?? Amazon..this is a missed oppourtunity to get potential customers to buy Kindle and Kindle products. It would keep current costumers."
Andrea In L..A.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had an old Kindle for a long time. Still struggling a bit to use this one as effortlessly but the built-in light makes it perfect for reading in bed or on a plane. It doesn't seem quite as intuitive as the old one but that may just be a learning curve. Battery life seems excellent. It is small, light and comfortable and even with the cover can be tucked inside a small purse."
Randy Darkcloud,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Battery doesnt last as long as i'd like at all, with maybe a week tops and thats only reading maybe an hour before bed and and short time in the bathroom library. I totally hate how your library is set up and almost no other options to setup or filter your library. Like how about by author AND then by series by that author, its so frustrating to not have the series grouped together for me. I also would love a wire with a button on end to click and turn page. When I lay down at night I set up kindle off to the side and I hate to pull my hands out of covers to turn the page. Or I'm just plain comfortable and dont wanna wreck it, so just holding a button I could click would be amazing."
M. Pandolfo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Almost perfect product... but...
The bad: I expected the backlight would adjust automatically according to ambient light, didn't happen.
The ugly: each time I turn it off, or turns itself off, the bluetooth connection is lost (that's ok) but cannot be restablished until I restart the whole device or at least turn off and on the bluetooth link. BTW, this is needed for audiobooks and is extremely annoying.

Besides, I cannot load MP3 files to it... I have some old ""audiobooks"" in that format that can't be used with this reader.

Overall, good, but with obvious points to improve... why didn't they?"
Izzie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am soo big on reading actual books because I love the smell/feel/look. However, we travel quite a bit and I'm a little snob when it comes to my books. I don't like them getting bent or dirty and I always buy hardcover. Makes it hard to travel with because I'm always afraid of damaging the book and it's bulky. Husband convinced me to get one and so I tried it and I am in love. I can take this anywhere with me and have more than 1 book which is nice because I read books fairly quick. Although I still love my books, definitely love that I found a great alternative!!"
Mike/Marie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this Kindle, mostly because it’s great for reading at the beach or pool. I have an IPad and a Kindle Fire and they don’t come anywhere near being able to read outdoors. One other plus is that it’s lite enough to carry anywhere, small enough to carry in a hand bag.
I gave it a 4 rating for the light brightness. My eyes are not great and would love it a drop brighter. Also, the charge does not last for weeks, but at least a week or a little more.
Also I have to give Amazon a 5 for customer service on this item. I have them call me and they call back immediately. The 2 agents I spoke to helped me both times."
Will,2.0 out of 5 stars,"OK but a couple of important caveats:
- you can’t connect it to WiFi networks like hotels because the built-in browser is so glitchy that it can’t even *display* the web page to accept the terms of service. Let alone accept them.
- the screen is blue. They call it “paperwhite” but it’s actually “paperblue”. We now know that blue light causes problems with your eyes (see “computer glasses”, might be a good idea to use them while you use this reader). It’s also bad for your brain to see blue light right before sleep. Which goes against one of the main purposes for a reader, which is reading in bed."
Ben Zeitz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For what you’re paying, this little device is great. It makes as a great PDF viewer, which if you know what you’re doing when it comes to making your own PDFs, Is great. Love putting my black and white comics on it. So why 3 stars you ask? I’ll tell you.
PIN HOLES IN THE DISPLAY
Amazon was kind enough to work with me on attempting to remedy the issue. There are these tiny holes in the light diffusing layer or the lcd or whatever, but in both my original and replacement model (which by the way had a different color backlight, so when the return came around that one went back). There aren’t many, but the one in my original model was quite noticeable when large black images came up. If only reading books it’s probably not an issue, but for PDFs and comics, it’s annoying. Seems to be a manufacturing issue that isn’t uncommon amongst these devices. And the majority of people who talk about it online just say, that’s what you get when you only pay $100 dollars. And maybe they’re right. You live and you learn I guess. Still happy with it, just wished it could work without that kind of compromise."
A.A.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned a few kindles. This model has to have the worst battery performance of each and every one previously in the market. Some times it just lasts two days when the wifi is turned on. While it seems a little sharper, it does not -- after a few months of using it-- warrant an upgrade from the previous version. Of course, if you do not own a reader, and you like to have every book with you, it does provide an excellent service, just be aware that recharging the battery will be something you will have to do often (more often than those with the previous generation of kindles). Also, I have noticed that the screen sensibility is somewhat off and it's more erratic than the previous one. For example, if you want to click on a footnote, half the times it advances to the next page. Or, if you're going to highlight some part of the text, it will turn the page as well more often than not. I rarely had this issue with the previous version. So, if new to the kindle world, get it. If you have the previous version and you do not need more space and are happy with it not being waterproof, save your money."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like that the new Paperwhite has a totally flat surface, no more raised surface around the edges. This makes ""swiping"" easier. I also appreciate the longer battery life. I do, however, find the home page tool bar more difficult to use, especially the ability to access the settings like font(different and less reader friendly options) and brightness, which are no longer in the same location. I also don't like the home page layout that makes it more difficult to access your library. I liked the library layout on my previous Paperwhite better. So while the actual device has some better features, the accessability to functions and reading material are more difficult to use."
Paula Tayson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd Kindle. With each previous purchase, I had noticed improvement in each purchase. Not so with this latest version. The battery life is POOR. I am charging the Kindle every 4-5 days, as opposed to every couple of weeks with my previous models. I always keep the airplane mode on to extend the battery life, but this has made no difference in frequency of charging. Will continue to use, as I now prefer this method of reading over holding a heavy book, but am very disappointed in this model."
M. Swanson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 2nd Kindle Paperwhite ( my first from 2012 lasted 8 years). I use it everyday, carry it with me everywhere. Easily fits in my purse or jacket pocket. The screen is easy to read with font style and size adjustable, along with brightness variability. The controls are different from my previous device, but not difficult to learn. Battery is holding well. The flat front takes getting used to as I was used to the frame. I am considering attaching a Popsocket to the back for more one handed stability/controllability. I highly recommend the Paperwhite."
infinite beauty,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a stroke 2 years ago and can’t hold a book for any length of time. My old Kindle started having power issues so was eagerly awaiting this new one. Really improved the speed of syncing and I love that it’s waterproof (reading in hot tub). This one is sure lighter than my iPhone! I use a popsocket to help me with holding Kindle for long reading sessions
adorajenn,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have previously owned only one Kindle and that was the Kindle Fire 7. I loved that tablet and still do. But I have found myself wanting a smaller, more convenient option that will also play my audiobooks. So after doing research I told my husband this was the one I wanted for my birthday. I bought the 32g without the ads no kindle unlimited

The things I love about it:

It's compact size. I can literally throw it in my purse and take it anywhere with me.
It's great for bedtime reading since it's so lightweight and well lit. You forget you're holding it which allows you to get lost in your reading.
The storage options. I purchased the 32g but you also have the cloud storage so you get all your books and audiobooks in one place. All you have to do is download them.
I bought a matte screen protector to help with the fingerprints not being everywhere and it to feel a little like real paper.

The cons:
The battery life is now what I was expecting. Most of the time I'm listening to my device and the screen is on standby and yet my battery seems to be draining. I think my Kindle fire had better battery life which is crazy. I got this because I thought the fire had poor battery life and it's a tablet!

My other issue and it's a biggie is the bluetooth connectivity. Several times in a day for no particular reason my ereader will drop connectivity. It's been very frustrating having to go through the process of reconnecting, or restarting my kindle, or any other number of steps to get it to reconnect with my earbuds. I've called Amazon and I went through six people with no honest solution to my problem. I've only had this device since last Sunday. I've updated my device, and their solution was to factory reset my device. Grrr. After researching on the internet I'm not the only one having this issue. So hopefully they will release an update that fixes this because it's causing me to have a very unsatisfactory experience with a device that otherwise I would love to pieces. I had issues with it connecting again today. I would just caution you that it might be an issue you face when you buy this device and Amazon is less than helpful when troubleshooting."
Karin MONTERO,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The box as seen in the photo had Kindle box against the side without any of the bubble wrap. And more important , the charging cable does not fit, I cannot charge with provided cable, the one from my third and fourth Kindles, works fine...this is my 13th Kindle (I have given them as gifts) and 13 usually is my lucky number ?"
Jessy Nelson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my paperwhite for about a month now, so I guess it's as good of time as any to properly review it.

This is my first paperwhite. I got a b&n Nook Color back in 2010 for Christmas, which has served me really well over the years. However, it reached the point recently where it wouldn't hold a charge and so I found myself in the market for a new e-reader.

I was drawn to the paperwhite because it was waterproof and would hold a long charge. I was a little leery about the black-and-white only nature of the paperwhite, especially as my previous ereader was in color, but so far it hasn't been an issue. I used to read comics on my Nook but haven't read digital comics in a few years, preferring print. This might be something someone who does read books with illustrations would want to take into consideration.

I really appreciate the long battery life of the paperwhite. I've had it for about a month and have only had to charge it once (and it had only gotten down to about 48% so I probably could have pushed it further than I did). I've been able to read several books with the battery barely being effected. The biggest draw on battery life seems to be using the store or trying to use the rudimentary Web browser.

I've been very impressed by the light, too. My Nook was impossible to read on in some lights, which hasn't been an issue at all with the paperwhite. I usually have the brightness adjusted to about the halfway point for casual reading, and brighten the screen if necessary. The brightest option COULD be a little brighter, but that's nitpicky.

The device itself is VERY lightweight and portable. I have dvd cases that weigh more. My phone certainly weighs more. It's not too big or bulky to hold; I can easily hold it with just one hand.

The only draw back I've really noticed is that the touchscreen is a little sensitive. Sometimes when I'm trying to scroll through my library, I end up selecting a title I wasn't trying to open. Other times, I might scroll through several pages by accidently hitting my thumb on the screen when holding the device. Buy this is a very minor inconvenience.

Also, I bought the option with ""special offers"". They in no way to impede my reading experience. The ads show up on the main screen when the device is not in use, or in a small banner along the bottom of the ""home"" menu. That's it. No ads popping up during your reading."
Diane Burrell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle Paperwhite is my third Kindle. To be fair, I keep about 650 books on my Kindle-rotating through new downloads, deleting books that don't meet the cut, and adding adding additional books in the series for those that are good reads. My first, basic Kindle was purchased 12 years ago, and lasted 6 years before it died. I upgraded to the Kindle Paperwhite, because I like to read myself to sleep. The Paperwhite makes it way too easy to keep reading into the wee hours of the morning. However, again, at the end of 6 years, the second Kindle died. Currently enjoying Kindle No. 3 -- another Paperwhite -- but with more storage (32gb). I have loved all my Kindles, and will continue to purchase this product."
Strangeproblem,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It functions just like my last Paperwhite, so it fulfills its purpose. I haven't tested the waterproof-ness of it.

The battery life seems to be a lot worse than my old paperwhite which I'd had for almost four years. This past Monday morning it was at 35%, I plugged it In and it charged until noon when it was at 100%. Today is Friday, I've read no more than usual this week and this evening it's at 34%. The battery lasts about 5 days, not a week, let alone the ""weeks"" the item description claims.

Amazon devices are getting more disappointing as the years go by - between this and the Fire10 tablet I was given last year - I am solidly underwhelmed."
Mrs_Snafu,2.0 out of 5 stars,I received this as gift for Xmas and I honestly regret asking for it. Because it's black and white it is impossible to change page color so best you can do at night is invert the color. Which makes it better to read but not great. It is super hard to navigate and you really have no control on page lay out. I have owned 5 kindles through out the years and this is not user friendly at all. Plus it is a pain to turn off and runs adds constantly. If I could return it and get a fire tablet I would in a heart beat. Plus it is only good for books that is it. For the price you should be able to at least shop on amazon with it. On the up side it is very light and water resistant.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After owning two Kindle Fire tablets, this is my first Paperwhite edition, and I only bought it because it's both waterproof and easier to read in direct sunlight, which makes it perfect for beach and poolside reading.

The Moko Case I bought with it is rugged, sturdy, wakes the tablet from sleep mode whenever it's opened, and sits on your lap at an angle, hands-free, making it easier to hold and navigate.

The only thing I was unpleasantly surprised to discover is that you can't turn it off. If you hold its power button down, it only offers you a chance to reboot it, so you have to set its WiFi connection on Airplane mode to save its battery life when not in use."
GamerX,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It moves MUCH slower than phone or tablet touch screens. It is not necessarily user friendly - I tap the top of the screen to bring down the menu to change the font.... but it just moves to the next or last page. It takes several tries to get it where I want it. It’s also not quite easy to switch to a new book - took so long I had to walk away and shake off frustration.

The backlight and anti-glare is fantastic! Swiping to the next page is good. The weight and size are nice. I’ll have to review again in a few weeks - I’ve only had it for a few days."
Steve Saullo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m an avid reader that likes the feel, heft, smell, and general atmosphere of an actual book. I put off buying a Kindle for years, even after I got them for my wife and kids. I finally gave in so that I could read while floating around in the pool, because the Paperwhite waterproof. WOW! I love it! I can carry the whole book around in my pocket with no weight or fuss. I can read in the dark, in the pool, virtually anywhere (even in a bank vault during my lunch hour). I’m a true fan and encourage everyone to pick up a Paperlight. No complaints about the light, the battery life... Well, one minor complaint: the placement of the power switch is a pain because my pinky finger below the screen tends to turn off the Kindle, but I can retrain myself. Highest Recommendation."
mmi,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The ereader came with a defective charging cable, apparently a known problem. Customer service advised me there is a 10 dollar credit to my account to buy the correct cable, but even after 45 minutes on the phone could not produce the credit. So I don't have any way to charge it.

As far as the reader goes the touch screen is kind of balky. My real complaint is why, why, why, do they make the screen smaller than average paperback page. Yes it's the size of the smallest paperback page, but not the typical page.

And granted it's the holidays, but customer service has been worthless: the chat apparently is working (on Macs?) and the phone call as stated went 45 minutes with no resolution."
Sonora,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Device is too small. Books are ok to read on it but PDFs are way too small. The menu is super complicated and controls are clumsy. Screen responsiveness is very poor. The bigger screen size is definitely not worth $300. Just get an iPad for that money. Also, Amazon charged for return. The only free return option is for me to go on a university campus drop off location far away. No thanks!"
dagger2255,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A while back I upgraded an old Kindle II for a used first generation Paperwhite. It was the best decision I made regarding kindles so when the new Kindle Paperwhite came out, I definitely went for the upgrade. I haven't tried the waterproof ability yet (and don't want to) but it's nice to have in case of accidents.

I LOVE the fact that Amazon lets you break the payment up in monthly installments so there really is no reason not to take the leap and get a new Paperwhite. I will always uses a Paperwhite as opposed to any other Kindles. I love the inward shining backlight. I have read mine on the beach in bright daylight and in the woods at night. It is very versatile and will not blind me from the brightness. I opted for the 32 gig version without the ads."
Brooke,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a bit nervous buying this as there wasn't a lot of reviews from people who love it. I've had my previous kindle for quite a few years now and was honestly still happy with it, did just what I needed to. But since this was on sale and with the trade in credits I decided to give it a chance. The biggest bonus is that it's waterproof (have not tested it out), so it will be great come summer time to read by the pool. The screen is nice, you can turn the light down so it has more of the book feel that I tend to enjoy, but you can also turn the light up for reading in the dark. I use good reads a lot and you can access it from the home screen and I love that it has an audible option. The battery life doesn't appear to be as long as my previous kindles, but that's to be expected with using the lights, I haven't had any problems with it dying while I'm reading though."
xz87zg,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm using a single star and writing this review to see if it prompts ANY response from Amazon. While entering a new WiFi address, I stumbled on the fact that the pre-loaded browser entry for Yahoo is the UK version. Also, I see that the Kindle has an ""Aeroplane"" mode! We live right here in the USA. Maybe the browser IS only an ancillary function, but since i did pay for it, I'd like it to work. Amazon, if you're listening, drop me a line."
Bons,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE Kindle and the Paperwhite is my favorite version. It’s light enough to hold up in one hand for hours, small enough to put in even small purses, very easy to see in complete darkness or bright sunshine. I replaced my old Paperwhite because I had pretty much met it’s storage capacity. This one has double the storage and is waterproof (or is that water resistant)? In any case I can read it by the pool or on the beach or in the bath and feel pretty safe about it not being damaged by a little water getting splashed on it. I recommend the Paperwhite for anyone who has or has not YET become a Kindle addict. It’s the best!😁❤️"
Bill,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I required a rather rapid replacement of my trusted Kindle paperwhite just after Christmas. On returning from our routine Christmas trip to visit granddaughter, my Kindle was run over by some reindeer rapidly returning north to escape the warm N.C. weather. Actually it was a Prius, but reindeer sounds better, Grandma was driving, not run over. Given the holiday, the new device arrived rapidly and I'm back to reading everyday. This one doesn't open by just opening my cover like the old one, but I like it a lot and the old one was losing it's sense of touch a little. I hope I never need the waterproof feature, but I do read in the hammock by the pool in the summer and on the beach if I can tolerate the sand."
teak,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was so excited to get this. And absolutely love the size. However navigating the screens is ridiculous. It flashes gray and white and black. I turned the settings to the correct settings to see if that would help. It will not connect to my internet whereas my other devices connected no problem. Trying to type something into the bar is just horrible. I wanted something lighter than my Kindle Fire. And easier on the eyes to read. So I was excited to get this. I will continue to find another Kindle
Toya,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so disappointed with the new Kindle paperwhite, I used some gift cards I got for Christmas to buy it, now I wish I hadn't. So I have some Bose headphones(that are Bluetooth). I like listening to my books with the text-to-speech function, but with the new Kindle it's almost impossible to just tap the screen and it starts reading, it takes me 10 minutes of fooling with it to get it to start reading. And then the volume doesn't go very high. I don't like the fact that it's always on. I own several other Kindled and I was going to use this one strictly for just reading, but now I wish I never bought it."
YEAH WAY,3.0 out of 5 stars,"1 feature that hardly works, which is a huge minus for this product for me is the highlighting text feature.
Let me say, I upgraded from a Kindle 3 Keyboard 3G and WiFi to the Paper White. I had read reviews, watched video reviews etc. Okay, my take: 90% true. Big improvements in screen definition, processor speed, operating system, etc.
For me, highlighting text for notes is a HUGE feature to basically LOSE with this particular Kindle. Yes, I suppose tediously one can highlight the utmost important parts. But it's a pain with the touch screen. ANd this touchscreen has no sensitivity adjustment!!!"
InannaMouse,1.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE:
I purchased the pretty blue 8G kindle thinking it had cellular, but it turns out that it doesn't! That's useless to me. I talked to customer support, who were very nice and helpful, and discovered that only the 32G has cellular and you can only get the black one. So it's way more expensive. I feel misled by the product description and I might have thought twice about sending in my old kindle, but at least the customer service folks were very nice.
______
Useless! It does not have cellular! Useless for an avid reader who needs to download books on the go instead of waiting to find WiFi."
Frankincense,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a Kindle Fire a few years ago and realized pretty soon after using it that I just don't like tablets. It was heavy and clunky and I just don't use it, either for reading or for the internet. This lightweight Kindle Paperwhite is exactly what I needed -- I can tuck it into my purse, read it easily on an airplane, etc. Really a nice little gadget."
Z,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First i see alot of complaining about life. There are many things to consider. Brightness of lights, how long you use , wifi being on and downloading. Downloading will eat up life the fastest i have noticed which sounds right for anything. Right now my kindle is at 91% it has not been on charge in 3 days. ive read, 3 to 5 hours each of those days and ive downloaded 2 books. I do not keep the screen to bright, i keep it at 4 bars. Which seems to be legit, i would say that if your kindle is doing way less than this, its possible a battery issue, you can easily get it returned and replaced if you notice this quick enough. I have always preferred books, but the kindle is less hassle and more tidy for sure. i do feel the kindle app on android is better organized in the library for sure. This would be all that i ask on the kindle. I have noticed that when i change the background to black instead of white, you may see some pinholes on brightness, most like for leds. I had to stop the black background as it gave me headaches. It was not for me. I also noticed the black background will drain the battery a little more, not much but it does."
King,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to like this, but I returned it. I thought I was getting WiFi and cell, read the specs carefully. Ultimately it was my error thinking it was WiFi and cell, however they should make it clearer, maybe in bold print what you are ordering. Also thought the size was too small compared to using a tablet. Last thing, the return process / shipping is very slow."
Shermaine,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked this 10th generation Kindle Paperwhite but I was not happy with the creamy background which is different than the crisp white of the 7th generation. I found that the letters were hard to read b/c there was less contrast. I called and was pretty much told to return it. I just didn't want to go through the process of returning it and also spending twice as much for the graphite one. I called again and got a much more helpful person who explained to me how to go in 'Settings' and then make the font bolder. Now I'm happy with it! That's all it needed, a darker print to help make up for the creamy background. The 7th generation also holds more text on a page - 4 more lines - which is nice. I don't think that the extra storage is as important as the read-abilty, so I can only give it 4 stars. It could also use the page turner button for more ease. Customer service needs more training on Kindle."
PetrofRa03,4.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I was disappointed, in that I have a Kindle Fire and had never had a Paperwhite before, so I didn't know it was ONLY black and white, and had no speaker. Those we BIG issues I had at the beginning, but I told myself to give it the weekend and then see what I thought. It doesn't connect to Bluetooth very easily to use the Voice Reader feature, which is something I like at bedtime, and used every night with the Kindle Fire, which has its own speaker so the Bluetooth option wasn't a problem before. However, it is MUCH easier on the eyes for reading than the Fire and is just all around much more lightweight and easier to use. The Fire is SO much cheaper tho, and if I hadn't gotten this on sale, I would have swapped it out for a newer Fire version."
KBinBoston,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always loved to read, but the collection of books that I had was crazy. I had just donated well over 100 books to the library and Goodwill when I moved recently. My son got me this for Christmas, and I've already gone through 6 full books. The only thing that I'm not too happy about is that there isn't a discount for Amazon Prime Members, or for Kindle Unlimited members, so I'm still paying about $12.99 for most books that I want, same as if I had bought the paperback from Amazon. I think that more books should be included for free reading when a Kindle is purchased."
Novel Lady,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Of all the Kindles I have owned since the original in 2008 I like this the least. I find that it feels like it is cheaply made. I don't like the lighting at all. I agree with the guy that says it is blinding when it first wakes up if you are reading at night and most of all it has the worst battery life of any model. I do not know how little you have to use it to get weeks of battery life but I read daily for several hours at a time, more if I am really into the book, and the battery is almost always drained when I plug it in before going to sleep. I sure hope it really is waterproof because that is the only new feature for me that I can see being a plus."
Toni Gomez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am
So pleased. I think people need to remember that this is an ebook reader at a phenomenal price!! It is not a $1000 iPhone. It’s perfect for my no blue light after 8 resolve and my arthritic hands.

I love paper books.... at 53 years old my books of hundreds and hundreds of books are full.

This is the answer to my reading.

And the fact that we can loan a book is wonderful.

This can not replace the feel, smell and tactile qualities of a book.

But I give it five stars for being everything I need in a e-book reader.

I am
So pleased !

Happy early Christmas to me and free kindle prime for six months."
Claw,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this as a gift from my boyfriend and may I say, IT IS AMAZING. I have always wanted one as a young girl, but have always used a tablet, my phone, or laptop to read. But, as years passed my eyes aren't as good and working full time and going to school full time I don't like carrying books. Having something so tiny can edit fonts, and layout really helps the experience. I now have a kindle membership and audio books. :) The only reason I removed a star was due to the fact it has no headphone jack. It is thick enough to have one and would be helpful to those who don't like Bluetooth. Also being able to connect to your Spotify account or music would be nice to have some back noise. Other than that I do love it!"
Grant Robertson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve seen quite a few negative reviews on here complaining about the durability, battery life, and ergonomics of this particular model of kindle. I, on the other hand, absolutely love it. It’s sleek, light, and easy to read. The touch screen works seamlessly and the backlighting is perfect.

Many of the people who are complaining, had some sort of technical issue. Maybe I just lucked out and got one that works perfectly (at least for now).

I’ve also seen several negative reviews saying the previous model was much better. I’ve never owned one before this one, so maybe I just don’t know any better. That being said, I really can’t imagine it being any better than this. Hopefully it continues working this well down the road without any issues! (I probably just jinxed myself.)

P.S. They aren’t kidding about it being waterproof. I dunked mine in a bowl of water and held it under running water, and it was completely fine."
Lawrence Howard Phillips,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my eighth Kindle/Fire reader/tablet. I still have my first generation Fire and it finally died after 10 years of service. All of my devices have been very reliable. The new Paperwhite is great because it is now water proof. My wife is an avid reader and likes to use the Kindle while she takes a bath. She no longer has the fear of dropping the Kindle in the water. My wife usually reads between 8 to 10 books in about a two to three week time frame. As a result, she is constantly loading new books to keep up with her pace of reading. The extra storage helps eliminates lags in connecting to her library and the Kindle store."
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ads state that the battery lasts about two weeks. Mine didn't even last a week and this is my second 10th Gen. The first one didn't even last a day! Sorry that I gave up my 7th Gen as I liked it much better. Don't like the font sizes..goes from medium to very large! Not like my 7th Gen where I had lots of choices. And, I don't like that every single book I ever ordered is on it. My other one was in Cloud. And, the icons at the top of the page are really small compared to the 7th Gen. In other words, I am very disappointed in this 10th Gen and am even thinking of getting a refurbished 7th Gen. It held a battery charge for weeks, not like the 10th Gen. I wouldn't recommend it!"
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an IT professional and i love to have functional tools. This one is not fully functional to my needs

Pros:
if you have a kindle format story book which is inline with this device. It works like charm

Cons:
1. I have checked many books are not in format which are compatible with this device even on kindle unlimited
2. This size is too small if you want to read technical documents
3. The user interface is not fully smooth
4. Kindle unlimited says it has ton of books, but i was surprised to see many of series like ""mercy watson"" and all are not yet in the format which this device needs. And even my kids were disappointed.

Overall i wish amazon comes up with some atleast 10-13 inch ebook reader, which supports multiple formats and also has tablet kind of functionality which could replace a paper. That would be more functional device and i am ready to buy that any day."
Jess,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very apprehensive about switching to a new Kindle since I love my old Kindle Touch so much. Since my old Kindle was so old it did take a while to transfer all of my books (and I had to do quite a bit of searching to figure out the best ways to do that), but after I started using it, I found it is similar to my old one but the screen is a little crisper and it has some other nice updated features. The only thing that I don't care for is that waking up the screen when I want to start reading is much slower than my old Kindle and the screen responsiveness is a little trickier. Overall, I am glad that I switched and am enjoying my new Kindle."
L. R. Werner,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has the ability to produce this reader with better graphics. Wait for an upgrade. If you read most of the time indoors you are better served with a Fire 8. Much better graphics - color and larger screen. Still easy to hold and read with one hand and it does everything.
The graphics, resolution and utility of the paperwork are so poor compared to other readers that you may never use it other than in the sun. It's much smaller and lighter and you can read in the sunshine but even there you notice lower graphic standards than other Kindle products."
LauraP,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I should have realized that a Kindle Paperwhite would be nothing like my old iPad. (The Kindle Firestick is a POS compared to a Roku.) It's not that it doesn't have apps, it's that everything works horribly. The display flashes every time I press the screen — it is so unresponsive that I'm tempted to throw it across the room half the time. And I've spent WAY TOO MUCH TIME trying to get my books on it — the network connectivity is awful. Here's a good example: I'm at a hotel and need to connect to the hotel wifi. Kindle asks ""the network requires that you login, do you want to use the experimental browser?"" Sure. OMG — excruciating to type in the information and then my Kindle can't recognize that I'm touching the checkbox to agree to conditions — doesn't matter what size that I zoom the display to — my finger does not ""connect"" with the checkbox. So I have to download the book to my computer, physically connect the Kindle reader to my computer, and then download the book. It is SO much easier to use my phone that I'm left wondering why I bought the Kindle reader in the first place other than I have a hard time reading books on my phone's display. Sigh. Amazon is definitely not Apple...and never will be."
GSFsr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I are in our 80's, and while I love my computer, my wife wants nothing to do with a computer but she would be lost without her Kindle, which we just upgraded for her at the Amazon Book Store on 34th Street in NYC.
The Sales Lady could not have been nicer and showed us how to transfer everything over from her old Kindle to the new one, which took a matter of a few minutes. Her new Kindle is smaller. liter and just as easy as her previous two Kindles to operate."
eilonwe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like that it's backlit so I can read in low light areas. What I don't like is that the letters blur when you turn a page and I'm a rather fast reader so that can get annoying. Other than that I like the idea that it's waterproof. One thing I do like about this kindle vs my previous one is screen sensitivity. With my old kindle, when my cat is sitting on my lap (he has a very very fluffy tail), if his tail even slightly brushes across the screen it will change the font size. Then I have to manually get into the font settings and change it back. There should be a feature to lock your font size and there isn't one as far as I know."
Connie Fischer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"That's right! This is the fifth Kindle I have purchased over the years and I'm loving it. It's great to have more space for my books. I have an avid consumer reader and reviewer for NetGalley and Edelweiss, reading well over 200 books per year. That means my Kindle gets a big workout all the time. My new Kindle is even more lightweight and it's such a fabulous thing to have. I am a huge Kindle supporter and wouldn't have any other e-reader!"
judy baldridge,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a new Kindle - after weeks on the telephone with Kindle reps who were all unable to get it to work - they finally agreed to repair or replace it. It has been replaced, but I am still disappointed that Amazon would take hours and weeks of my time before replacing it. When something arrives broken, I expect it to be replaced immediately without hassle. Amazon clearly did not take that approach - they have taken the position that it has been replaced under warranrty, not that it was broken upon arrival. What an insult - and this was not my first kindle purchase. Extremely disappointing."
Great Smile,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my new paperwhite kindle, very light and easy on the eyes reading. The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is the contrast switch when paging. Kind of irritating to flash white on black. Also I was not impressed with tech support when I asked how the paperwhite turned off. There is no mention in the directions that the paperwhite does not turn off, instead it goes to sleep. When I contacted the support they kept telling me to hold the button in and eventually it would shut off, this was not the case and just found the answer on my own thru asking the question to the crowds."
Cheryl,2.0 out of 5 stars,I have had a paperwhite for a few years and decided to upgrade because of the special offer and because my battery was not staying charged for as long as it did when it was new. My new paper white does not hold a charge for half as long as my old one (even though it was a few years old). I am very disappointed with the All-new Kindle Paperwhite!
WaxTadpole,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As much as I love what a Kindle is, it’s time for an upgrade. The display tech is feeling very dated for 2019. The backlight is harsh, and not great for reading in bed. The touch screen is just OK. Kindles are great for reading on the go and in well lit spaces without all the distractions of a smartphone. But even for this purpose, the overall experience feels dated at this point."
Joey D.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Why did they remove the page turn buttons? The touchscreen is terrible. I've had this less than a year, and now my kindle is registering turns incorrectly.

When I try to go back a page instead it goes forward. Now I have to try again twice, and if it goes forward I will completely lose my spot. It's frustrating, when I want to relax and read.

Also, when I need to go to the home page I have to touch the screen twice, and hope that it registers correctly. This is just poor UI design.

Come on Amazon Kindle team! Get these issues worked out, and don't follow the smartphone trend - it's a different device! Make it its own thing, and give us some buttons, please and thank you."
Catwell,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Kindles overall. :-) my last one was also a Paperwhite that I purchased in 2014. Don't know the exact name of it. Compared to older Paperwhite: Negatives: 1. It takes longer to wake up. 2. The charge/ battery does not last long Positives:. 1. Being able to read in the dark. It is superb! My husband tried it out in the dark. He is a very picky person when it comes to purchases. When he came out of the dark closet he said it is ""awesome."" I don't often hear him say that. Reading in the dark may not be something you need. However, for me , I often read at night in bed with my husband sleeping next to me. (I am a night owl, he is early to bed early to rise). 2. it says it's waterproof but I have not tested that."
M P,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this! I had a previous regular Kindle but I was tired of the battery dying every time. I never have a problem with this battery. If you shut off the screen and leave the Bluetooth off, the battery lasts for a week/week and a half. I read for several hours a day and I find that this is satisfactory. I turn the white down too so it’s not too bright. It’s smaller than a regular Kindle. I recommend also buying a case for it too."
S. Orozco,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Barnes and noble quit updating my 7 year old nook. Now of course, a brand new kindle is going to blow a 7 year old anything out of the water. I can't say if this is better than a current gen nook. But I like that it tells you how many more minutes in the chapter and % done with the book. My only complaint is that it doesn't tell you the battery is dying until it is basically dead, so you have to rush to find a charger. You can see the battery level when you go to the menu, but when you are reading for a long time you may not check that. Then it's like ""your battery is low"" and a second later ""your Kindle will power off if you don't charge it"" type thing. Wish it would flash like a 30 minutes or hour left warning when you are in reading mode"
Elle,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the Kindle Paperwhite for reading books comfortably and easily. However....After having this for about 6 months I noticed the battery life was not as good as at the beginning. I only ready perhaps an hour and a half each day, not all at once. I check the charge icon after each time I read. Now after having this for a year frequently the battery charge will read between 83% and 93% but overnight the battery is nearly dead! This is not every evening to morning but much more often than not. I feel cheated out of the money I spent to get what I thought would be a very reliable ebook item. It is great except for the poor battery quality but that's what powers the rest of it. Buyer Beware!"
James A. Thorson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is her second Kindle Paperwhite. She gets monthly shots in her eyes to arrest the progression of the disease. This has prevented total blindness. Because she can make the type big, and because the type is back-lit, she's able to continue reading books. Her first Paperwhite seized up several months ago after about five year's use, so we purchased a new one. Oddly, the first one has now come back to life, so she reads books on the new one and plays games on the old one. We are very pleased to have these, as the large-type books no longer work for her."
MarDenWar,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After years of debating over this purchase, I decided to go for it. Big mistake. The first Kindle Paperwhite had a messed up screen, some strange event I guess. The replacement KP was just fine screen-wise. However, I've had problems with it freezing up during/after charging. The battery charge doesn't last as long as I thought it would (based on what I'd read and heard). Then again, I probably just read for too long at one sitting. I think what bugs me most of all is that it never seems o sync with my android phone and Kindle for PC. That annoys me. Otherwise, I suppose it's an okay product. I doubt I'd ever purchase another one. I'll just need to purchase a phone with humongous storage space and download power for ebooks."
Cheryl B Urban,3.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first opened my new Kindle Paperwhite yesterday, I was so excited! I was replacing my 2010 Kindle that is no longer chargeable. The new one is slightly smaller and very sleek and it charges very quickly. However, as I downloaded my content, I noticed that my beloved word games (Thread Words; Every Word) did not transfer. I went to the Kindle store looking for those or other word games and found that there is almost nothing available. Even the Word Search games that are offered are pretty lame. Don't misunderstand...I DO use my Kindle for reading, but also spend time trying to increase my vocabulary with the word games. I am VERY disappointed that I have to leave those behind with my now ""dead"" Kindle. Also, I'm not sure I like not having a raised edge around the screen. If my finger even slightly touches the screen, the page changes. So far, the new Kindle leaves me mourning my old one."
Someone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There was a battery life issue at first, but after I learned about how it indexes, that was cleared up. If anyone is also having a problem with battery life, you can search for any random letters in the Kindle (dojsjhfjs for example) and when text in books comes up, click on it and it will show you what hasn't been indexed yet. After that, you just need to wait and keep it charged. If you want to keep it on and indexing all the time, you can search for ~ds and then the screen will stay on until you reboot the Kindle. You can look for other Kindle commands online.

It's a relatively good e-reader."
st,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After looking at all my options I replaced my 2016 Oasis with a new paperwhite. I've had battery issues with my Oasis for the last couple of months and it got to the point that I had to charge it daily. It would show 90% charged one minute and then drop to 0%.

I chose the paperwhite instead of a new Oasis because of the problems I'd had with the Oasis and the fact that it was half the price. After using the new one for a couple weeks I'm glad I got this instead of a new Oasis. Other than the lack of the page forward/back buttons I see little difference between them. The plastic screen is a little different that the Oasis's glass screen but not that notable. It is also about the same size as my old Oasis - a little narrower and a little taller so I can still fit it a jacket pocket. I think the new Oasis is a little larger and more inconvenient.

I've had it a couple weeks and am still on my original battery charge. So far I'm pleased with it. We'll see what the future brings."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted this reader just for that reading, not for pictures or anything else. I plan a cruise in December and wanted an reader that I could see during bright sunny days on deck. Well I must say the screen is great even in bright areas and it's been working flawlessly so far but I have only had it for about a week. So far so good and water proof is even better especially I'm bound to be near a pool and off shore excursions by water. It's very light and thin and easy to hold in one hand although I purchased a nice case which is also very light and doesn't add much weight at all. Great reader!"
Robert Summers,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Kindle Paperwhite's support for Audible books makes this new Paperwhite extremely useful to me. I have paired my new Paperwhite to my Honda car's speaker, to my Apple AirPods, and to my Amazon Echo Show. Now, whether I'm driving, walking, or at home, I can use the new Paperwhite to listen to my Audible books. Previously, I had to use the Audible app on my iPhone to work with these devices, but this tied up the phone when I needed it for another purpose. I've now deleted the Audible app from my iPhone as no longer needed.

I have both the Kindle version and the Audible version of some books. The new Paperwhite's ability to easily switch between the two book versions is quite remarkable.

5 big stars for a marvelous device."
Gail Yander,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After eight years the battery on my old Kindle would no longer charge. It had served me well and I enjoy reading on my Kindle as it is easier to transport than hard cover or paperback books. I ordered a new Kindle Paperwhite which is slightly smaller and lighter than my old one. The touch screen is much easier to use, but it took me several weeks to become comfortable using it, particularly organizing books that I had downloaded into collections and deleting samples that I no longer wanted. The one thing I dislike about the new Kindle is there is too much emphasis on books that I may want to read. Amazon's algorithms are based on books that I've read and I prefer to read several different genres"
DogMom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter is a 6th grader and LOVES to read! Every week she used to beg me to put books on hold/take her to the library... and the weight of her many library books just added to her already overweight backpack! She received the Paperwhite as a holiday gift and it was a HIT! She loves it. It's lightweight, holds tons and tons of books - most of which are available from the library with a much shorter wait (if any) for the ebook version & it easily fits in her backpack without added bulk or weight. She LOVES it!"
Len,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First time Kindle owner - really loving this device , I've been using it a few hours a day and have had no issues at all. Very light and easy to handle. Touch screen is responsive and very clear. Be sure and update the firmware to get the latest and greatest software."
Amanda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As someone that has always had an issue reading from any electronic for extended periods of time and likes the feel of an actual book, I am surprised as how much I enjoy this product. During the day or with adequate lighting, I turn the back light off but in the evening, the soft light doesn’t hamper my reading. It’s no weightier than a good chapter book or a hard back and is relatively easy to hold. It fits almost anywhere I want it and I often stick it in my purse because you never know when you might want it. The books are easy to find and many of the suggestions are great. My only warning is to be sure you do not accidentally press the audible box unless you want it. I made that mistake with my first 2 purchases but I will say audible was very understanding and help to rectify this quickly. I love the settings that allows you to changes fonts, font size, and margins. Highlights are helpful (my children will probably use it For school required books) and the dictionary has been helpful as well. I’m still exploring things with my kindle paper white but in the month I’ve had it, I’ve only had to charge it once after the initial charge and that was almost 2 books in. If you’re going to spend the money for the kindle, be sure to get the adapter for charging. It’s a bit pricy for a plug but well worth the money for a life long battery. All and I This was one of my smart buys and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys books but hasn’t the space to store a library."
Mike,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m impressed all the way around. I’ve been a converted e-reader fan for about 8 years and have tried reading on an early Kindle,an Asus (??), a Kindle Fire and most recently on my iPad when the Fire battery gave up. After almost breaking my nose with the iPad while falling asleep while reading, I began the search for a new e-reader. I was drawn to the Oasis because it cost more so must obviously be better but after going to Best Buy to see how they “felt”, I found that the Oasis just didn’t feel right. The price of the Paperwhite made it a no brainer once I accepted the fact that I was just there for a reader (not a pseudo iPad). After two weeks, I’m very happy and I still have only charged it the one time. I was concerned by the small size but find it very convenient and comfortable to read. The Fire was great when I didn’t have the iPad but the battery was frustrating, especially at the end. If you already have a tablet, the Kindle Paperwhite is the only choice."
Erica Ariel,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon should bring back the voyage. I thought I was trading in the voyage for a better/updated Kindle, I was totally wrong. This is light, bigger and bulky, feels flemsy. Amazon should have discontinued this model, and update the voyage and oasis. Also, still not super happy with the response times between screens or setting options.

That said, it does everything I need it to do, and better than any other e-reader on the market so you'll still have to pry this from my hands and I'll still keep it and mask some of the imperfections with a case and matte screen protector. But I'm holding put to trade in again for a more sleek model."
Ferris Beuller,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love reading on my Kindle and it is hard to go back to paper books. This is my second paperwhite; my other one ended up at the bottom of the lake. I waited a week for it to recover then bought a new one because I just can't be without.
New one is water proof so that is good in case it happens again. The backlight seems to have a more yellow tint. Instead of the paper ""white"" look of my old one it is paper ""yellowish."" Also the power button is in bad spot and slightly more sensitive so it seems I am always bumping and turning off my kindle which is a pain in the butt."
SV,3.0 out of 5 stars,"We did a compare and picked this paper white since it said that it had the cellular access which we had on the Gen 2 kindle we currently owned. When it arrived it did not so we once again called up the compare feature to make sure we hadn't missed something and it was listed and then we clicked on the model. It is not listed as an option on the paperwhite as it is on the Oasis (although the compare function says it is free on the Oasis too). You have to scroll to the bottom of the order on the paperwhite where it says ""We Want You To Know"". Very misleading and really soured what should have been a good experience of getting a new Kindle."
K. Greene,1.0 out of 5 stars,This description mentions cellular connection throughout. This device DOES NOT HAVE cellular connectivity. This is yet another Amazon bait and switch tactic. Not worth the money or the frustration to purchase from Amazon any more specifically because of tactics like this.
Michael,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to read at night and adjust font size. Unfortunately, holding the left side while reading and turning pages on the right, often causes jumps to the previous page. Another surprising feature is that sometimes when advancing to the next page it actually skips all the way to the index at the end of the book. When you try to return to your last page, you can't unless you happen to have noted the page number you were originally on... so you have to go to search and seek ""last page read"". You get there eventually, but it is a bother. Adding a none-sensitive flap along the edge of the reader would alleviate the problem."
Bleu Moon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my paperwhite! I also have a fire and while I love watching movies and playing games on the fire reading is something I can't do for long before my eyes start bothering me, also when reading outside or in bright light the fire had glare and was hard to read on, but that's not the case with my paperwhite! No eye strain no glare no problems outside love it for reading! Lightweight great size nice feeling your hands and if I forget my reading glasses I can adjust the text size and enjoy my book! Completely happy with my purchase highly recommend."
E. A. Shaw,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was excited about the dark mode on this model, but it has not actually been very helpful. You can set the kindle to display the text in white and the background black. Unfortunately, the black is not a true black and the screen is still pumping out a ton of light even on the lowest brightness setting. Enough that I can visibly light up the room with the light coming from the screen.

Also, the dark mode doesn't remove the blue light. Basically I like to read in bed but I feel like this kindle is blasting blue light into my eyes even on the darkest setting, and I've hardly ended up using it because of that"
Amber Massengill,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can not recommend the Kindle Paperwhite enough! This device is everything you need and more! It is thin, high quality, and is backlit in a way that it doesn’t harm your eyes. I have my older Paperwhite, but just had to splurge on this one to try out the audible feature. And it is also waterproof, but I’m too afraid to test that out. If you are reading the reviews and trying to decide whether to splurge, do it! You won’t regret it."
dw,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a previous version of the Kindle reader, but had moved away from it for a while and read off of my phone or tablet. I really like the backlight option, and I also enjoy reading off of the electronic ink much better than my phone. I also really wanted to have a separate e-reader so I was less interrupted/tempted by other apps on my phone. So now I find myself reading more and more purposefully. The Paperwhite settings aren't 100% intuitive, but it doesn't take long to get accustomed to it. Overall, it's well made and is great to have around."
rosie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never go anywhere without my kindle. This one is an upgrade from the first one I purchased. The first was an impulse buy as it was on sale and I was going on a trip. I am a lover of old fashioned books and I had my doubts about the purchase...until I received it and became ¨sold¨ on its convenience. I love that my upgrade is lighted. It makes it so much easier for me to read in bed or on a night time trip on bus, train or plane. I have not given up old fashion books, but I am so glad to have this kindle, too. In re battery life, it is adequate, but I do not think it lasts as long as written."
Mulie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all, to get it out of the way; 1) My All-new Kindle Paperwhite has too small a print on the
home page. 2) It is too hard to find the page you want to go back to. I do not like this change from
a page devoted to finding where you want to go in a book, location or page, to a lousy scale range on
the bottom of the page you are on, that doesn't work for me.
NOW: The good stuff. 1) Love that it is waterproof! 2) Love that it has 2x the storage! 3) Love that
the battery lasts so much longer! 4) Love that the cover I got on sale (Pink gold), when you open Kindle,
it wakes it up! 5) Love that it is lighter and a little bigger!"
L. S. Brodsky,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third or fourth Kindle, my Voyage battery life became minimal so I traded it in. This works fine, but I liked the page turning buttons on the Voyage. Amazon does not seem to make a Kindle the same size as the Voyage with the same features, unfortunately. The one thing I really like is the case open-close wakes-sleeps the Kindle. Also, although Amazon offers a price discount, in addition to the credit, on a trade, I would have had to send them my bad Kindle first. Doesn't make sense to me as I wanted to be sure the new one worked and had my content before I sent the old one back."
Jeffrey Couch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is so slim, lightweight, and easy-to-hold that I was honestly blown away. In fact, it's SO slim and sleek, I definitely recommend a case, simply to give it more substance to hold. The screen is a delight to read, whether in full light, or in pitch black darkness. It took some getting used to with the way the screen refreshes with each page-turn, but that is a TINY nuisance far outweighed by having so many books for any mood with you at all times. And the battery life is superb."
Nellie B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hesitated for years to buy a kindle, but am glad I did. I bought it specifically because my eyes were bothering me from reading on the iPad and on computer screens. Because you blink less looking at bright screens, my eyes were drying and having trouble with focusing because the lens thickens. THE KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM. Lack of glare and adjustable brightness and font size allows you to read for long long long sessions without eye strain. Other pluses include being able to stick it in a coat pocket and being able to read in the bathtub. Not to mention carrying a thousand book library with you at all times. I also really like having something dedicated entirely to reading, as it keeps me focused and less pulled by other distractions."
from50613,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first eReader for myself & I love it!! It’s very lightweight and easy to use with the settings—such as the back light on it. The fonts are easy to read and it’s hue/glow of the back light is very appealing and easy on the eyes. I’ve held off because I love physically holding books, but this is really great & I will continue to use it! I do recommend getting a covering with the automatic on/off cover as it gets annoying to turn on/off with the button. I wish the screen was a little bigger, but it’s true to the measurements they give."
L. Henderson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried an earlier version of the Kindle (one without a backlight or touchscreen) and I think two versions of the Kindle Fire, and I've ended up selling them, because I simply found it easier to read my Kindle books on the Kindle app on my phone or iPod. However, I REALLY like this latest version of the Kindle. The backlight is just right in all conditions, from full daylight to nighttime viewing, so I never have to adjust it. The touchscreen is very responsive. And, best of all, the battery life is literally weeks instead of hours! That makes it ideal for commuting and long-distance travel. This Kindle has been a winner for me!"
J. John,1.0 out of 5 stars,"First, let me say that this device is really slow and the touch screen is not very responsive.

Let me now talk about the kindle unlimited issue that I have. I give this kindle to my kids to read and you have to give your kids access to the Kindle Store in order to give them access to Kindle Unlimited. This means they can buy books using your account! You cannot just provide access to Kindle Unlimited or require a Pin to restrict purchases. It’s either all or none, which is a terrible configuration.

This kindle is going back."
Will,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Received this for Christmas and it is awesome!

Disclaimer: this is my first e-reader so I have nothing to compare it to. I am also a very new user and still haven't made it through the user guide... which is like 1000 pages and is very helpful but slightly intimidating!

Battery life is great and lasts for weeks.

I like the 'paper-like' option with no back-light for daytime reading. Easy on eyes and reads like a book. Honestly, I'm surprised at how 'book-like' the Kindle actually reads (also thanks to the leather-like amazon cover I received as well. I know that sounds like a bad advertisement but it's not. Another item I wouldn't have purchased for myself but so glad I got for the protection and feel). Only concern is that if you accidentally take brightness all the way to 0, you won't be able to see anything in the dark and it may be hard to find the 'increase brightness' symbol. The Kindle looks to be OFF in this mode if you are in the dark. NOT a complaint because I love it during the daytime, just a caution to anyone out there that may be reading while trying not to bother kids or spouses. Low-light is really good (better than my cell phone) but stop at 1 unless you have light.

Only issue I've had is that the Touch screen can be finicky if your hands are super dry. Noticed this after working outside in cold. Seems like touchscreen doesn't recognize finger if hands are too cold/dry. Lick your finger, put on lotion, or don't abuse your hands and I think you'll be fine.

Cant speak to it yet but I recently downloaded the ESV Bible translation (for FREE) and I'm looking forward to being able to bookmark, highlight, and make notes wherever and however I want without limitations of margins and poor hand writing. This makes it worth the cost to me for this feature alone and all the books are a bonus!

Dont quite understand it yet but you seem to get 2 free books every so often but you have to choose from a list of 6 or so books. I think they might be new releases on the Kindle format maybe?

Overall extremely satisfied with the Kindle so far. It's very intuitive and you really don't need to even read the guide unless you want to learn more about some of the lesser used or less obvious features. Definitely beats reading on iPad or phone by a long shot. The battery life and ease on the eyes make it worth the investment (although I must admit I was VERY hesitant to get one and would have waited for next years' Cyber-Monday sale if Santa hadn't hooked me up). Best gift and so glad I have one now. No longer have to leave lamp on to read and you can't beat the portability. At 4.75"" x 6.5"" in the case it's pretty much a large cell phone. On that note, also love being able to read without interruptions from text, emails, calls, etc.

Hope this was somewhat helpful. Good luck and happy reading!

-Will"
Alden Witman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite was purportedly created with convenience in mind. Its size is small enough to stash in a purse or a coat pocket, but large enough that reading still feels luxurious and comfortable. The screen is easy on the eyes in all levels of light, from bright sunlit days to pitch-dark rooms. I highly recommend this E-reader!

One of the key features in any electronic device is battery life. In my experience, the Paperwhite's battery lasts for over a week on a single charge and charges quickly when depleted. After reading on my Kindle daily for over two months, I have yet to see it without energy on a single occasion. This includes a set of long plane-rides I took, on which I was reading heavily for numerous hours. The battery life is stellar, and so far shows no sign of any performance decrease over time.

The shopping experience on the Kindle is intuitive and straightforward to use. The Paperwhite can take some time to load search results when browsing for books, but it is perfectly adequate for the price point. The library organization is also easy to use and highlights the books you are reading at your home page.

The advertisements that are included are very minimal, with small banner ads on the home screen and shop pages, and nothing distracting when you are actively reading. This version leaves a 'frozen' advertisement on the screen when the Kindle is asleep and must be swiped away when it wakes up. The advertisements are easily removed on the Amazon website for $20. Take note that in order to remove the advertisements one must set up One-Click Pay online. This can be disabled after the removal.

The accessibility on the Paperwhite is versatile and easy to configure. Customization controls allow different paragraph layouts, font sizes, emboldening of letters, and even negative lighting to swap the blacks and whites on the screen. My partner has dyslexia, and reading on the Kindle with the dyslexia-specific font makes reading much more enjoyable for her.

The 8GB of space is more than enough for a plethora of books to be stored at a time. The BlueTooth capabilities also work great with audiobooks. It should be noted that you have to download the audiobook versions separately in order to listen to them offline.

The only slight con that I have noticed with the Paperwhite is that sometimes the screen can be slow to respond to tactile input, causing double actions. This issue is only minor and affected me only a few times.

Overall, I highly suggest this e-reader if you are in the market for a veritable digital library that you can take with you anywhere! I give it five stars."
S Brandt,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Picked this as a Christmas gift from my children.
I should have read the reviews and description better because I didn’t realize that everything is only in black-and-white. This is my first ereader, but I have 2 other Kindles, so I thought I was getting something different then this. This Kindle is just for reading only. But I can use my iPhone, lap top and even my TV for everything else LOL!
This one is very light! And VERY small! ( again comparing this to my other kindles )
I have not used it enough to comment on the battery life or taking it to the beach/pool/bathtub to test out the waterproof claims.

I just hope I can get used to only seeing things in only black-and-white , never realized how the colors/ pictures on a cover of a book jumps out to me until I can’t see them in color ( A life lesson )

I am already a kindle unlimited subscriber and the book ads do not interfere or bother me at all.

Will update as time goes on"
jedilui,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Kindle 2 that I absolutely loved! Zero glare, long life battery, slim, excellent storage for all my books. It finally started glitching after 9 years of use. I wanted the same thing but Amazon does not sell it anymore. I was directed to buy the “All-new” Paperwhite. And I am disappointed! There is glare, the back light creates its own glare. The battery lasts less than a week and I only read about 10 mins a day. It stalls out when I try to open it at times forcing me to restart it. It doesn’t have the great word games I enjoyed on my previous Kindle. I’m sad. I have a feeling I may return it that’s how disappointed I am in this product."
Linda F Gilbert,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted a new one as near to the one that was broken (my last Kindle), but I'm not sure that is what I received. I chatted with an Amazon rep at least twice, searched the site numerous times, even purchased one that, once received, I knew it didn't meat the mark and returned it. So, I'm learning to use this newest one even though I don't really like it - yet. I'll keep trying and see what happens. I do like the fact that it weighs less than my last one, and that it is water proof. I only use my Kindle for reading when I'm not home (medical office, etc.) and do not use audio books or videos."
Victor Malagon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I picked up reading again around the beginning of this year, and read mostly on the kindle app from my phone. Since then I have been reading about 1000 pages a month. I was tired of seeing my own reflexion/the reflexion of the sky on my screen all the time and finally pulled the trigger on getting a kindle paper white.

Ever since I got a kindle, my reading has significantly increased; between July 1-14 I read 370 pages (no kindle), and between Aug 1-14 I read 970 pages (kindle) even though I have been considerably busier than I was at the start of July. The larger screen, being able to read while walking outside without seeing any glare, and the lightness of the kindle make it very easy to read pretty much anywhere. While there is glare if you sit, for example, directly under strong lights, it's usually very easy to readjust to avoid that, and reading outside in broad daylight poses no problem (unless you're aiming your kindle at the sun, obviously). I've seen people complain about the battery life but I haven't had a problem; I charge my phone every night it's really not a big deal to charge my kindle once a week. It's not perfect, but it definitely makes me read more than before and for that I would strongly recommend it.

Quick book recommendations of books I've read recently: ""Make it Stick"" by Peter C Brown, Henry L Roediger, Mark A McDaniel, ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear, ""11/22/64"" by Stephen King."
Denise A. Doctor,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The first thing To be aware of is from my sixth generation to my tenth generation, a book that has been downloaded to the computer in the past is immediately in the Kindle ready to read. In the 10th generation this is no longer true. The book needs to be downloaded in the Kindle as well, so you need to remember to download it again. I do it at home off the modem/router.

Beyond that I have a problematic Kindle that is in the process of being replaced. I have had a Kindle for years and really like the product. Unfortunately the particular Kindle I was sent has some bugs. It tends to crash in bunches and frequently. It's other oddity is that it offers up the restart screen frequently and with no prompting. It's kind of annoying. Otherwise, I like the machine. I preferred the feel of the glass screen to the plastic but soon I won't recall the difference."
Marques,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a Paperwhite that I bought back in 2016. I like having the audiobook playing while I read, and I assumed now with the bluetooth audio capability I would have been able to do the same. I can't, so I have no reason to upgrade to this over what I currently had as I couldn't care less about the waterproofing. It's a nice Kindle, but mine is going back."
Bright_Owl,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle Paperwhite – Now Waterproof with more than 2x the Storage – Includes Special Offers
The touch of this new kindle paperwhite seems to be a lot less sensitve than my older PaperWhite. With severe arthritis in my thumbs, this is a Big Deal for me. Also there is a big black border around the text area, so I have to reach further to advance the page. Again, a Big Deal. I really wanted the 32gig storage capacity so that I don't have to keep swapping stuff out, but if using the thing is going to be so much more painful, I am not so sure it was worth the investment."
Jerica Kay,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the bundle and I like it. (the bundle isn't really worth the money though, I'd buy everything separately) I'm still used to that really old kindle with the keyboard though. But I like that I can read it in the sunlight or in the complete dark. It is a lot smaller than I imagined for some reason but still really nice. Haven't tried the waterproof stuff yet since i can't use the tub for a bath, only showers and its way too cold here to swim. Can't wait to try it out in the summer. If you want a kindle, I would only get this one if you like new stuff or if you want it to be waterproof. there really isnt any difference to any other kindle than that."
R. Boast,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, I'm loving it.. This is my 2nd paperwhite...and I haven't had it long enough to know battery life.. I only use airplane mode to read.. I find the touch screen has too much hesitation when Wi-Fi is on and I don't need it in except to download anyways. I did have a bit of a problem ordering a case that would allow wake sleep to work correctly....but that is another review"
R. T. Shafer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this device as a reference tool and have many PDFs loaded in it.
The absolute best thing is it's battery life. It's not dead after a few hours of use.
Can't be beat except maybe by the one with more internal storage. (or a larger screen size)
Highly recommended.
I did try e-books with it and it works great with them as well."
paladin1234,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought I would never want a kindle. I love books and saw no reason to get an e-reader. Then my library started having books that you could download. I learned that I could download books onto my smartphone, and tried that. The lighting on the phone bothered my eyes, so I bought a kindle paperwhite. No more glare and so many more books are now available to me through Bookbub, prime reading, prime first reads and the kindle owners lending library. I still love reading actual books, but with the kindle paperwhite the options are amazing."
Ashley T.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now, I wasnt expecting much when I bought this, just something to read on to save my phones storage lol. But I'm in love with this paperwhite. ❤ Yes it seems a little slower then your normal tablet would be. But that's the thing, this is made strictly for reading. I love the actual feel of it being like I'm reading a book, it doesnt hurt your eyes at all. Every angle you tilt it you can still see clearly. Theres no blind spots. When I first opened it. I thought there was a sticker screen protector on it 😂 nope folks that's the actual screen! I was like omg it doesnt look like a tablet or phone screen at all! And I love it.
😍I'm officially a kindle lover. In the past I only used legit books or my other LG tablet to read. I'm NEVER going back. Thank you so much for this great product!!
Also when you buy this product the box is so slim! So dont very shocked!!"
femme azure,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the adjustable light! Battery is great. No charging needed for days and it charges quickly. This is lighter than my former Kindle Paperwhite , which I traded in. I carry smaller purses now, due to a shoulder injury, and the device does not give added weight nor bulkiness in my purse. This is really like reading a book. Now I rarely read a “ real “ book. ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️ this!"
Allibaba51,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This new Paperwhite is just a bit smaller, a bit lighter, and it is water resistant. I haven’t used the water
resistant part, but it is a good feature to have. The light is good, I don’t see much difference from the
previous Kindles. No problem with opening. Nice touch for turning pages. I recommend this new Kindle
Paperwhite."
SlimeBallBuilder,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Big fan of the paper white. I used to read a lot as a kid and teen, but I stopped reading for fun around the time I reached college. I've been wanting to get back into reading, so when the Amazon sale cropped up I decided to go ahead and get the paperwhite, because I didn't want a tablet that was very big. I would say it's a good size, and very easy to read from. Very good purchase, as now I read again everyday. Would recommend to anyone who wants to get back into reading, or just wants to switch from reading books and having to have good lighting to read them. It's great for my morning commute, I take the train in, and it's great for reading a few pages on the go."
grandmab,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery died in my 2nd generation paper white. It wouldn't hold a charge even when not being used. So I bought this new one. I thought I would have to go in to my account and download any books that I hadn't read or finished yet that were on my old Kindle. Imagine my surprise when I finished setting up the new one.....97 book covers. There were dozens of books I had already read years ago showing up on it. I had to click on each one I had already read and mark it 'read' in order to get rid of the 'pic' from the page. Now what is the sense in that kind of programming. ? Nothing should have shown up until you go to your account and click on the books you want downloaded to the new Kindle. It cost me two evenings to get it all straightened out. As for the new Kindle, I'll report on that down the road."
YvLoo,1.0 out of 5 stars,"What I don't like about this Kindle:
a) When swiping it to start, an pop-up comes on asking how you want to continue, Cancel, Restart, Screen Off. No matter what one I tap on, it restarts and takes forever to do it.
b) So often I have to swipe several times to get to the Home screen.
c) On several occasions when I open my book, it has gone back to the beginning of the book, and I have to swipe thru all the pages until I get back to where I was. It will not go to where I left off.

My first Kindle which was one of the first additions worked better than this one."
SyXbiT,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a travesty this doesn't include USB-C. It's 2019! Unfortunately I'll still need to take an ancient micro USB cable with me when traveling. I also wish it had physical buttons to turn the page like my old Nook. Physical will always work better than an on screen swipe. You don't accidentally press a physical button.
However, everything else about the device is really good. Great screen, backlight, weight. And a good OS that mostly stays out of the way."
Lindsay T. Blum,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first ever e-reader, purchased as a gift for my fiance. He loves it! I'm glad I waited for the All New Paperwhite version to come out, for the waterproofing and from what I've read, the flat screen (no bezel). The display is crisp and clear. He loves that you can highlight text/excerpts to reference later, and the built-in dictionary is awesome.

My ONLY complaint is to the packaging. Whoever fulfilled this order placed the Kindle in a large box with literally ZERO padding/paper/bubble wrap - absolutely nothing, which is shocking. I have no idea how much it banged around during shipment. 1-Star for fulfillment, only for actually putting it in a shipping box."
GeezerCaveman,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My two libraries use the Overdrive/Libby and CloudReader apps. Libby can save checked-out books to Amazon for download, but CloudReader can not. The Paperwhite readers are incapable of running any version of Android, so getting useful apps outside of Kindle on the reader is impossible. That is a deal-breaker for me. I'm not into ebook readers to spend more money. My property taxes pay for a library and that library does a fine job of obtaining 99% of the books I want to read and not being able to use those services makes an eBook reader useless."
Patrice M. Lucas,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My old paper white started glitching and lagging from too many books so I bought a new one. The new one is okay and is lighter but I feel like it was easier to read on new one and now I'm having to reorganize all of my books I haven't read yet, its a pain as its difficult to remember which ones I have read. The best system was the Sony, I wish Amazon could buy their software and adapt it for Kindle, then it would be perfect. Sony's was more adaptive and remembered what you have read in the past. Too bad Amazon put them out of the ereader market."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There are many things I like about my new Paperwhite, such as the size and convenience. The screen is sharp, the lighting is good. However, I don't think it is very user friendly. Maybe it's because I have been so used to my old Kindle with the keyboard that I've used for many, many years. But I find trying to create folders, put books in folders (already read, low priority, rejects, etc.), viewing unread books, and navigation in general are more awkward, harder to do than with my old trusty Kindle. I will keep using my new Paperwhite and may learn to love it like my old friend."
Reading Fool,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not sure why people complained about the battery life. Mine stays good for several days WITH the Wi-Fi on and constant reading. I love the lighter weight compared to my old one (2015), the smooth front and the slate blue color. Still fits my old case. This is my go-to for traveling as my phone (while OK with the Kindle App) is not as easy to hold or read as my Kindle. I haven't tested the water resistance - I don't read in the shower or the rain, and don't expect to. The offers aren't intrusive, and in fact sometimes lead me to a new book."
Dan S,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife is an avid reader, but she has always been partial to books because she reads all summer lying by the pool and then when we go on vacation, it is usually to a beach. I finally broke down and spent the money on this paperwhite because it is waterproof. No more worrying about getting it wet by the pool or on the beach. The battery life is great but the proprietary software sucks...can't use hoopla. The response seems to be a little slow when turning pages but maybe it is cause we are speed readers and it is designed for the average reader. Being able to read in direct sunlight is great and now I won't have to take an extra bag filled with books on vacation any more."
JC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Paperwhite and I am impressed with it as a pure reader. I purchased it at Best Buy and had to return the first one since it kept restarting for no reason. Very annoying. The second one has made reading a delight especially in the sun light.

I am a little disappointed that I can’t add some basic apps to it …for example , OverDrive which I use to get library books or even my calendar or email apps.

Nevertheless, I am extremely happy with the product and I find it less of a strain on my aging eyes even without the sunlight reflecting off the screen."
C. Lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a diehard Kindle fan. This is my fourth. I started out with a Kindle Fire gifted from my daughter. Became addicted to reading eBooks. That kindle died a sad and untimely death after many hours of use. I replaced cv it with my first Paperwhite. Seldom leave the house without it so that I always have at least one book to read if minutes ope up. This Paperwhite is another gift from the same daughter. I love the size, the weight, the fact that I can read in any situation, even in bright sunlight. And the best part is this new one is waterproof. Life is so good!"
R. Roth,5.0 out of 5 stars,I haven't read many books lately because our house doesn't have a lot of good reading light. This completely solves the problem. Also my old eyes appreciate the adjustable fonts. It's great to just pick it up and start reading without having to move a lamp or find a seat in a brighter area. Just the right size as well. As someone who doesn't always like change I was worried that i'd miss the nuances of a real book. I'm impressed that I often forget that I'm not reading a real book and find myself trying to turn a page rather than just swiping. The only thing I miss is that it doesn't tell you what page you're on but rather what percent of the book you've read.
JessJessVIII,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I made a resolution to not buy any books since my shelves are stuffed with books I haven’t even read yet, but I can now use KU or check out ebooks from my local library, reading as much as I want, and saving quite a bit of money.
The only issue I’ve had so far is when the battery gets below a certain point (about 20%), it decides that it’s already dead so I can’t do anything with it anymore except charge it.
And maybe I’m spoiled on other touch screen devices, but it’s pretty slow or unresponsive when I’m trying to scroll through books. It works fine turning pages while reading."
Pete,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The updated version of kindle paper white is great . Beside the battery life is still not as good as I expected , with the Wi-Fi mode on only last 5 days with avg 3 hours reading time a day. Overall is a great product , with the new waterproof feature. Love it ."
bludeacon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace a Kindle Voyage which I loved, but was killed by someone spilling a bottle of water on it. That may not have been so bad, but it was in a plastic bag and not discovered for several hours.
Anyway, Kindle has great battery life as advertised and is waterproof, a feature I won’t test purposely.
I don’t like the touchscreen as well as I liked the haptics on the Voyage which could be used with either hand. Other than that so far so good, oh yeah, I also preferred the origami case on the Voyage much better than the book case that fit this one. Thanks."
Camesha01,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been without a kindle for a few years now but decided to get one mainly because I was tired of my battery run down on my tablet and I tablet was quite heavy to hold especailly when reading in bed and let's face it there are just too many distractions on your tablet. After reading a few reviews and the kindle basic and paperwhite, I decided to get the paperwhite.
I have a tendency to read for hours and hours, and you doesn't, right?? my battery literally lasted about four days, four freaking days..... like what the hell!!!!!! I bought this mostly for the weeks of battery life promised and only got 4 days. I am extremely disappointed, this is the third kindle I have owned and have ever had an issue with the others, so this is quite an unwelcome surprise from an amazon product."
Katherine S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"bought this kindle to replace a 2015 Kindle Paperwhite which totally and irreparably crashed for no apparent reason. I have to admit I'm hooked on it for reading, but I also had a word few games installed on the old kindle which I really enjoyed. This kindly is strictly for books. There is nothing else you can use it for. It's not any better than the 2015 version. Amazon doesn't let you know this in its product description. Don't really care if it it's waterproof. I'm not going swimming with it. It's a downgrade as far as I'm concerned.
Edit"
Gigi613,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Really disappointed in the new Paperwhite. The screen on the right hand side all of a sudden went black. It looks like there is a bulb out in the bottom right corner. Had to mail to the warranty department to see if they can fix it. I have only had the Paperwhite less than a month and already a problem with it. My last e-Reader was the Oasis and I had problems with it the minute I started it up, now I have problems with this Paperwhite. I am hoping they cannot fix it and I will get a new one, because after not even owning it a month there is a problem. What will break next on it??"
bjd,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I knew before buying that the light wasn't as bright as other Kindles, but as a ""tub reader"" who often ruined books when I fell asleep, the waterproof aspect was more important to me. As for the touch screen, it works great for turning pages, but I think that once I've put in my password to turn it on, I shouldn't then have to put the password in again to turn it off. And I'm disappointed in the battery life. It's OK, but not the ""weeks"" that was touted. I have read ways to extend the battery life such as turning on airplane mode, but it still goes down faster than I would like. I compared notes with a friend who has an earlier model and she insists her battery lasts much, much longer. So, it's a nice addition to my gadgets, but not everything that it was touted to be."
Michael,4.0 out of 5 stars,"the only reason I rated the touch screen at 4 stars is that when I turn the pages, the screen tends to flicker occasionally and temporarily (only a flash of a second) display a reverse image (black background and white letters). My wife has an earlier model of the paperwhite and it doesn't do that. Other than that, having this Kindle sure beats reading books on my phone!"
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second Kindle Paper white that I have had that quit working long before I expected it to quit. This time I left home with it working and when I took it out of my purse, it would not turn on. The light on the bottom lit up for 1 second and then turned off. It did not show any signs of waking up. Because I read so much every day, I ordered a refurbished model to replace this one. I do like the paper white because of the features it has, but I wish it would last longer than 4 months. Can I return this one? Thank you, Audrey Ziebol (azofmpls@gmail.com)"
Business Education Teacher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had two Kindle Fires and loved them. Therefore, I was at first disappointed with my new paperwhite. For one thing, it is smaller. However, I only had to read a few pages to realize how much better this is on my eyes, especially when reading at night with no other lights on. I found the size was not an issue; if anything, it is easier to hold. I love this Kindle and would highly recommend it to all. Plus, it holds a charge much longer than my other Kindles and recharges much quicker. Five stars all around for this purchase. I love it!"
Susan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used an original kindle since they came out. Decided to upgrade to the new paperwhite so I could have a back-lit screen. So far I love it. I text is so much more clear than the original kindle, and I can easily read in bed without the bedside lamp on high. I also purchased a new cover (since the paperwhite does not fit in my old cover. I think the cover is overpriced but I like how it works, and I like how it fits in my hands. The new menu is taking a little getting used to, and none of the books I was reading on my old kindle are syncing to the right place on the new paperwhite, but these are small issues. Overall, I am very happy and it won't take much to get used to the new setup."
Mavrik,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this Kindle Paperwhite as a birthday present, I love it. Of course with all things there's pros &cons. In comparison with my Kindle fire , as far as reading on it, the Paperwhite is much easier on my eyes. The battery has lasted a lot longer but of course it only has books on it not all the other stuff so of course it's going to. But overall I love it for reading in bed. I would recommend to anyone who loves to read."
Michael S. Clurman,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is at least my 3rd Kindle Paperwhite. In general the software and hardware has generally improved and matured. This is the first model that claims to feature bluetooth connectivity for listening the audio books. Unfortunately the bluetooth functionality is terrible. I've tried it with several different sets of bluetooth headphones. All of the headphones connect to my other mobile devices easily on the first try. With the 10th generation paperwhite I generally have to make many (average about 10) attempts to get a connection before I succeed. Sometimes I just give up. I bought it in December 2018 shortly after the 10th generation was introduced. Perhaps it's a problem with early models. I should have returned it a long time ago. Too late now but very disappointing.
smm,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do NOT buy this version of Kindle! It is so much worse than the kindle paperwhite I bought years ago. It does not find my home’s WiFi, so I can’t connect to the internet with it. (I had this trouble with 2 of them. Returned one, received replacement, and went away for vacation with it still in package. Unfortunately, the one I now have was able to connect to WiFi where I was on vacation, but for some weird reason it does not find, my home WiFi, and now I’m beyond the return window.) It also does not wake up when I open the cover I bought to protect it, so I have to force a hard reboot about every other time I pick it up. Don’t know what I’m going to do, but I feel robbed. Wish my old kindle hadn’t died; although, that one did give me 6-7 smooth sailing years, and I read a lot."
Spike,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle e-reader. I've been using a Kindle Fire and Android tablet for reading and this is at least 1000 times better. Unlike other reviews here, I can't compare to prior models. It's very comfortable to hold and it's easy on the eyes, no complaints there.

What I don't like - it's slow browsing my library and the primitive browser means many web-based wifi logins are difficult, I couldn't get in at a Hilton Hotel and several stores when they required a web page for login.

I do have to mention that in addition to being waterproof, it's banana-proof, just in case anyone was wondering."
Tensenj,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I put off purchasing one of these way to long. The thing that bothered me was the high cost of some of the ""books"". Nothing to do with the reader, I know. However I have been pleased with the quality of free eBooks available.

The ability to set so many parameters for the font and page layout as well as the feature that makes it easy to find dictionary definitions, just hold your finger on a word, and also the feature, X-ray, that allows you to get prior text clips from any character in the book make this superior to an actual book in many ways. I love it !"
Devin McCrea,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to like this device, but unfortunately Amazon’s QC has slipped to an astounding degree. I had to order a replacement for a device with a defective screen, which was relatively painless. Then, I received my new unit with an ok screen, and loaded up a long book... the complete works of H.P. Blavatsky. I get that this book is obnoxiously long, but it CRASHED this device, again and again. It’s unreadable on the Paperwhite. So, I decided to return it. Upon informing Amazon of this attempt, the representative on the phone, who had been clearly informed that this was a return on principle (if you can’t read any book, why own the device? It’s made for that sole purpose), and not a defect. I was in my window to do so. After a long conversation she let me know that she was processing my exchange, as opposed to the return and refund I had asked for. She finally, and not happily, issued my return label.

Avoid this device. You are playing the lottery with screens and it can’t open every book (text based) that you throw at it. It’s also slow as all hell. Also, the battery life is not anything to write mom about. Get an Oasis or an iPad mini.

Note on the iPad - for distraction free reading, just don’t install distracting apps. Can’t help with the screen, though."
Tim S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this to replace an older 3rd gen Paperwhite that finally gave up the ghost after about 4 years of heavy use, and I've been very pleased with it so far.

It's about the same size and weight as the older Paperwhite, so it's extremely comfortable to hold, but the screen is now flush with the bezel instead of being slightly recessed, which makes it a bit easier to accidentally turn the pages.

The display is incredibly sharp and has a ton of adjustability (font type/size, margins, spacing, brightness, etc...) and it's very easy to read in both low-light and bright (natural or artificial) lighting conditions, even when wearing sunglasses. The screen side-lighting can be turned up to an absurdly bright level, but even in pitch dark rooms, I never have it on more than 9 or 10 (out of 23), so pretty much anyone should be able to find a combination of settings they'll like for this.

As in previous generations of Paperwhite, the battery life is superb. Using the Kindle for about an hour a day, I'll charge it maybe every 2-3 weeks, and even then, it's still got about 60-70% of the battery left.

The only downside to this product is that Amazon REALLY wants you to use their store to buy books, so there's a couple of minor annoyances (like not reading metadata to organize books within a series) related to adding books from somewhere else, but there's 3rd party software (I use Calibre to convert stuff on my PC) available that lets you easily work around those issues if you're bothered by them."
Randy Wolf,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not much of an upgrade from previous model. In fact I can't discern the difference. My model is currently frozen and this is the second time since I bought it. There doesn't seem to be a way to reset it other than letting the battery run down which, since I just recharged it, will take weeks. Not happy.

Edit: An Amazon rep contacted me immediately to help me with the frozen kindle. Turns out it was operator error, that somehow the battery had discharged overnight. I recharged it and it works perfectly. The discharge may have had something to do with the cover I also purchased since I had just charged it."
Joe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my initial review:

I have used my Kindle Keyboard 3 extensively over the years and honestly I feel foolish not upgrading sooner. I didn't think going from 167ppi to 300ppi would be much of a difference but boy was I wrong. Finally having a backlit e-reader is seriously a game changer too. I have had no issues with glare or finger prints and the battery life seems more than acceptable. I shared the same concerns with others about the visible ""Kindle"" logo at the bottom and I just wanted to say that it's no big deal at all. You barely notice the logo, even more so in the slightest amount of shade. I'm the kind of guy who puts black tape over the logo on my TV and I won't even bother doing that with this.

Overall, I'm quite impressed with this reader and look forward to putting many hours on it."
Caleb A. Brown Jr.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a really big Kindle Fan. I've owned 4 different models. My Kindle Paperwhite (7th gen) got crunched up in the hinges of my recliner chair, so I purchased the new 10th Gen Water proof Paperwhite. It's a good reader, but the character contrast is lacking. It's just not as clear and easy to read as the older version. Playing with the fonts and boldness helps somewhat, but still doesn't match the display I'm used to and it slows down my reading. Returned this one (Amazon is great with returns) and ordered a 7th gen version instead."
Stephen F. Hager,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Had an older Kindle for years. died trying to replace battery. NEW: Like swipe compared to buttons; like back light in low light conditions. Don't like constant ads. Old sleep mode graphics were better/good. Don't like library interface it's complicated by . . . what looks like more ads to me. Old library interface had a simple list of books. (that's a period there.) If you wanted new books, you CHOSE to go to the ""Kindle Store"", would prefer that the store not be my constant companion. OK there's probably some way to customize all these objection away, but I didn't want another learning curve; I wanted a Kindle READER."
mdwho2,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The cat tipped my water onto my old kindle, so I decided waterproofing was a good idea. It is. But - I had several games (Sudoku and such) that I can no longer use, it now takes several steps to wake this thing up, AND to get to my list means I have to touch a small part of the screen -- which, if I miss, takes me somewhere else.

If this was my first kindle, I'd probably love it. It isn't and I don't. But having all my books in one small package is enough to keep this thing, although I'm now reading a lot more real books now."
Jenna Lynn,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded this kindle from my 2nd generation kindle and I’m sorry to say, I greatly regret it. The battery on my older generation would last for up to a month and this one is barely 1 1/2 weeks. Also I often read at night and the older generation was great and would not hurt my eyes. This new one raves about being able to read at night but even the lightest setting is to bright if you’re reading in near darkness. Also the warm setting blinds you with a flash of bright white each time you turn the page.
Overall I am sorry to say that I am very disappointed. I really wanted to like it but I miss my old kindle which I traded in."
Todd L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The size and weight is perfect. No arm fatigue like holding a heavy book. Downloading free books from our local library is so easy as well. Now my wife can cut back on trips to the library except for when a book is not available on Kindle. Purchased this one for my nine year old. She loves it. Now her seven year old brother wants to use my old paper white kindle so he can get library books too. It has definitely propelled both of them to read more. They love that they can see the percentage of the book read as well. Very happy with my purchase. Battery life is awesome and the touch screen is way better than toggling.
Shell J,3.0 out of 5 stars,"There really isn't much of an upgrade from other editions. Sometimes it feels a bit lagging and the battery is definitely shorter lasting.
Also DO NOT trade in your device. I was given this advice but decided to anyway since my Kindle was in great condition. They revised it's worth to $5 and for that I should have donated it.
Really, I'd wait to see if the Kindle changes in the next year or two otherwise, it's just not worth the upgrade.

Side note; I read 3-4 books a week on average so my Kindle is a constant companion."
Val,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the new Paperwhite because my 2nd generation Paperwhite was starting to really slow down. I normally do not replace a device until it breaks however Prime day gave me significant saving on the purchase price; so I caved. I enjoy my new device more than my old one due to the new features and lighter weight. The wait time for the Paperwhite to wake up doesn't bother me at all. Actually, I makes me read the ad rather than just swiping. I since found at least 2 ads for free books of which I was interested. The battery lasts just as long as my older Paperwhite; even with the Wi-Fi turned on. Other reviews were correct about the power button. It all depends on how the device is held while reading. I accidentally turned it off once just a few days after receiving it however, not again since."
Shannon McLemore,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this as a gift and adore it! It was something I didn’t even know I needed or wanted but now can’t put down. It’s easy to buy and look up books. You have access to samples before you buy. Prices are cheaper for several books, plus you don’t have to lug around the heavy hard backs everywhere you go. The paper white technology is fabulous and doesn’t hurt my eyes as I had feared previously. The back light system has actually proven easier on my eyes and allows me to read longer than before. I’m shocked! I’m sold! I’ve even started to buy books I was already reading in hard copy because I prefer reading from the Paperwhite. I highly recommend this product!"
Margo Arel,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After having my last kindle for ten years this is a big disappointment. It is too small. Unlike its predecessor, it does not resemble a bookreading experience. It resembles a child’s toy. The touch screen is constantly turning pages because the device is so small when you pick it up, it’s impossible to not touch the screen. I miss the buttons for both back and forth located on both sides of the device. I don’t understand everyone’s objection to the ads which are not obtrusive at all. It is the device that is really a piece of junk."
craig brotko,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love that it remained the same size as the older ones. It is a bit lighter, about 3/4 oz. but it’s noticeable. I do like that the screen is flat now. Overall if you own an older version it’s not a must have upgrade but I read so much I decided to treat myself to a new one. These things pay for themselves by not having to drive to the library. I can find way more to read online from Amazon. A hint if you live near a larger city you can signup with their library for a larger selection of books online than a smaller one will offer."
Ali Lee,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle. I like most things about it: the size, weight, display, etc. the thing that I wish was different is the screen. Sometimes I have to press several times to get it to respond to my touch. Then the way it transitions from one thing to another appears glitchy. That takes some getting use to. The setup of the kindle was fairly easy to do. I wish the battery lasted a bit longer than it does. I fully charged it and read for about 6 hours and the battery is at 68%. The way the description sounded, it would last several days on one charge. I guess that means if you’re not using it or using it very little. Other than that I really to enjoy it. Oh lastly, be careful when getting books for free using the kindle unlimited service because it not careful you might accidentally buy the audiobook like I did."
Walter,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not like this Kindle. It is difficult to go back to review something in a previous page. It is difficult to get back to the home page. In a book that I was reading I touched the screen for the next page and behold I was at a page that was almost the end of the book. I had to scroll back since I was nowhere near the end. I really like my old Kindle. It was easy to scroll forward or back. It was easy to go the home page or to access the dictionary if I needed it.

Matthew Crist,2.0 out of 5 stars,I received my new paper white Kindle for Hanukkah from my husband. I specifically sought out this one to replace my original that does not have the lighting. This was purchased at Best Buy and I am very disappointed with all the advertisements when the screen is off as well as from the home page. This was unexpected as not indicated anywhere on the packaging and not on any of my other earlier generation Kindles I have owned. Had I known this I might have just stuck with using the app on my phone. Stinks that you pay money for something just to read books on to get bombarded with adverts.
Jason R. Earnhardt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like that the overall format of the new kindle is so similar to the most recent previous generations. The real difference is of course the waterproofing, but I don't see that in my daily reading. The smooth face (no more raised frame around the screen) is an improvement in my opinion. the edge of the frame used to collect grime and lint, etc, and was difficult to clean out. Screen resolution and visibility are equal to the previous generation, as expected. I do feel that the page turn response time is very slightly slower on the newest kindle, and wake-up time takes an extra second or so. Overall, I recommend this new waterproof kindle to new buyers or anyone ready for an upgrade. There is nothing to gain but waterproofing if you have the prior model."
HHopkins,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I still love paperback books, BUT it’s very convenient to slip my Kindle into my bag and carry it everywhere. The battery lasts a long time, storage is not a problem, and I was able to upload the ebooks I already own. I wish the screen was a little bigger— but it doesn’t strain my eyes to read, which is a huge advantage over other devices. Awesome device!"
Joni,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this product. It was given to me as a birthday gift and I haven't had an E-reader since the Nook HD.
I enjoy reading on my paperwhite much more than reading on my phone, laptop, or tablet. I also love the size and it's more comfortable in my hands than books. I love that it has a built in light and waterproof feature so I can read in the bath if I want to.
Other reviewers have mentioned they thought it had a poor battery life but I have not found this to be an issue with mine. I still have yet to charge it since it's initial charge when I received it and I've read approximately 35-40 hours. It's battery is currently at 48% and I haven't had to turn off the wifi either.
Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product."
Nathan R Meyers,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been wanting the reverse light background for ages. I like reading white text on grey / black background when I'm in the dark as it's easier on my eyes and doesn't disturb my wife as much when I'm reading in bed. The flat screen is fine, but I worry a little about fingerprints. I guess we'll have to see how that goes. So far, I've had no problems with it and since I caught it on a great sale I feel like the upgrade from the Gen 7 I had was really good value. I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting to get an e-reader."
sj,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a really great upgrade from my other kindle. The screen surface is very smooth and the overall design is responsive and compact. The adjustable backlight is a great addition and the waterproofing is a bonus. The battery life is fantastic, lasting weeks without a charge. You can save some money if you trade in an older device. It makes a great gift. There is a power button on the bottom of the device next to the charger allowingme to turn on or off or put it to a screensaver mode to pause in between reading. I am really happy with it and its working for me."
L. Hooke,4.0 out of 5 stars,Anytime you get a new model of something you are used to there is a learning curve. Most things work fine. Battery life is not as good as I thought it would be but I don't make an effort to turn it off. One thing I really haven't figured out - on my old kindle when I got a new book it was just there and ready. With the new one I seem to have to click on the link on the kindle to download while I have internet.
lleach,1.0 out of 5 stars,"bought it in December. Read ONE book on it. Middle of February it will no longer charge. Replacement warranty runs out after 60 days. Mine stopped charging after 70 days. Called Amazon and you get routed to a call center in India. They want to send me a refurbished one. Asked to speak to a supervisor as I didn't want a refurbished one. I would expect a Kindle to last longer than 70 days and would like a new one or my money back. They only thing they offer is a refurbished one. No supervisor, no one to make a different call. I would expect a devise that sells for $130. to last longer than 70 days. Customer service is AWFUL.... DO yourself a favor and buy a NOOK"
HARTJO,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OOPS I GAVE REVIEW FOR THE COVER OF THE KINDLE PAPERWHITE OVER THERE....WELL THE TOUCH SCREEN ISN'T SO EASY TO USE I DON'T THINK. AND IT WASN'T SO EASY TO SET UP WITH MY WI-FI....BUT ONCE I MADE IT THROUGH ALL OF THAT THINGS GOT LITTLE BETTER. IT IS SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE...BY THE WAY THE COVER IS NICE TOO. I WAS HOPEING IT HAD COLOR AND AUDIO SO THAT WAS MY FAULT SHOULD HAVE READ THE DESCRIPTION LITTLE CLOSER....OH WELL I'M GOING TO KEEP IT IT FITS IN MY PURSE VERY NICELY AND WILL READ THE BOOK INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO IT, THE PRINT IS ADJUSTABLE WHICH IS NICE."
Jason P. Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this to replace my Kindle with a keyboard. I loved that keyboard Kindle...took it everywhere. I was very sad when it finally gave up the ghost...but having gotten a Paperwhite, I can't believe I didn't upgrade sooner. The Paperwhite is so much lighter and more responsive, and the back light is great. The touch screen can be a bit temperamental at times, especially trying to access the menus by swiping down, but overall I feel it is relatively responsive. Flipping pages feels much more natural when swiping the pages vs the buttons. In short, I really like it, and I'd recommend it as an e-reader to anyone in the market for a new one."
Chewy2476,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Does the job for me. I don't mind the embedded ads as they don't interrupt your reading experience. Screen is crisp and bright. Coming from Kindle keyboard, I'm missing a few keys and sometimes turning the page mistakenly, but overall touch screen is useful. Response rate should be improved and I'd actually like a sturdier body. It feels delicate and I'm afraid of scratching the screen. I'm generally a happy customer who continues with a second Kindle in the last 10 years."
Sam,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The on/off button is on the bottom where I use a finger to hold the device with 3 fingers on the back and my thumb on the side. I frequently inadvertently turn the kindle off while reading.... Very annoying. Please relocate the on/off button to the top or high on a side where it will be out of the way for most readers. Otherwise I really like all other features; lighting, menus, touch screen, battery life, etc."
DSK,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My latest kindle arrive timely and is easy to use. It's a bit smaller than my previous kindle, but still okay. I read at night before going to sleep and can dim the light so it doesn't bother my husband. I also like that I can increase the size of the text. The information that came with the new kindle said the battery would last for weeks. Nope, about 7 days max. I liked that I didn't lose my previously purchased books! That was a huge plus. It is just the right size to fit in my handbag, and doesn't weigh much. It's easy to use and I didn't panic when I spilled my hot tea on it, just wiped it off and it's fine. Whew!"
RT,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Opened up my brand new ""All-new Kindle Paperwhite"" and thought it curious it had a smudge or scratch on my pristine screen. After it booted, it appears to be dead pixels about the size of a pencil head."
Selim Gamer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love reading with my paperwhite and it uses only a little power so I am not always recharging it. But anyone who owns a smart phone will quickly notice the clumsy commands and primitive operating system. I would like to see some improvements for example: You can adjust the character size when inside a book, but when reading adds and other information outside of a book, you have no flexibility. For most people, text vision problems don't go away when they are outside of a book! Also the text roll up outside of books is frustrating for me. I have to tap the screen several times before it works. It would be a five star product if only they would improve the out of book reading experience."
SaseboMeg,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 2nd paperwhite, replacing my original 2012 model. I am extremely pleased with this new one because:
The touch screen is much more responsive
The screen is completely smooth
Wi-fi connection is much faster and so is navigating the Kindle store
I also like that it is much easier to access the settings to turn airplane mode on and off
The home screen has different options to view your books, including your wish list.

I'm still learning all the new features, but my first impression is that this is a great improvement over previous generations of the paperwhite."
D.Miller,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had every type of kindle (I think). I bought this one because the battery life on my previous paperwhite had deteriorated. This one isn't much better. I'd give it a pass.
Update -- I took my review down to one star. My kindle now will neither hold or take a charge. It's 4 months old. Totally unacceptable. Of course, it's past time for amazon to accept a return."
Jon M. Nelson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle. I started with the one with a keyboard and page-turn buttons and had a non-waterproof version of the Paperwhite before this one, which I love. It’s very well-built, thin and lightweight, holds more books than I can hope to read, and the battery life is excellent (I keep WiFi off until I need it). I carry it with me everywhere and find than I’m reading more than I would otherwise. It’s one of my favorite possessions. I highly recommend it. If i had a gripe, I wish they still included a charging block, but I have others to use."
CKIM,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my older Kindle Paperwhite for the new version and completely regret my decision. It's touted as having amazing battery life, but honestly, the battery doesn't last as long as the previous generations. After reading one book (approx 500 pages in one day, battery was already around ~60%.

Also, I have my wi-fi linked to my Kindle and the process to download books is frustrating. I have Kindle Unlimited and books I download to read WILL NOT show up in my library unless I press down the power button to restart my device.

Page turning does not seem to be as quick as the previous Kindle as well."
kygirl,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth kindle, and by far my least favorite. The screen is great for reading, but the power button is awkwardly placed and I shut it down by accident all the time. The touch screen is pretty sensitive- if you accidentally touch anywhere near a chapter heading you’re booted out to chapter list, and if you’re like me you have no idea what chapter you were reading, so you need to to click around for a while to find your place again. I could live with those things, but the battery life is terrible. Mine is set to the lowest light possible and I only turn the WiFi on long enough to download a book. I still only get 3-4 days of life, which is probably 4-6 hours. My older paperwhite was good for weeks at a time."
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Dropped my original kindle, worst day ever! New paperwhite has no phone cell network connection to down load books on the go. It does not respond well to touch and the home page loads up recommended books in preference to my existing library. Touch screen is far inferior to the kindle buttons. Home page choices are terrible and rarely respond to the first touch. And worst of all, there is no text to speech reading. Rarely does a next generation device have less than the original. This is a poor but perhaps deserved substitute, as I was the one to break my lovely first kindle."
Jaq Greenspon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle and I love it. I especially appreciate the waterproof aspect, so now I can sit in the bath or on the beach to read and have to worry about it getting wet. That said, it seems the battery isn't quite as good as the earlier paperwhite models and the screen isn't as clear (and I miss the chapter timeline) of the Kindle 4."
S. Steven Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It worked great and was just what I expected after having read many reviews and all the information Amazon had available.

I was honestly a little surprised at the compact size as I was replacing the much older model with the keyboard. At first I’d thought that the screen was smaller than my old one so I compared them side by side and they were identical. The body just fooled me due to the compact design.

I love the screen resolution and the “paper white” color is much better than the paperback gray color of my ancient Kindle. Back light is great for reading any time and it’s even hard to notice when it’s engaged versus when it’s not. The resolution is very and easy on the eyes.

I bought Amazon’s leather cover and was surprised that it put the kindle asleep when closed and woke it up again when opened. They must have mentioned it but I’d missed that point. Even with the protective cover it’s all still quite compact and portable.

All in all, I love my new Kindle."
Amazonian 1234,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very pleased with the quality of my all-new Kindle Paperwhite. However, I have had a poor experience with the Kindle Unlimited 6th Months free promotion and my trade-in. Purchasing the Kindle when I did (as a pre-release) included a promotion for 6th months free Kindle Unlimited. There was also an offer to trade-in my older model kindle (which worked great). I decided to take advantage of both of these offers when I ordered. Since the Kindle was a gift, I did not try to redeem the free unlimited offer until after Christmas. At that time, it would only give me one month free. I called customer service and after a very long conversation, a ""ticket"" was created and they promised to resolve the problem. I waited three weeks and called again today. The person on the phone was unable to help, so I tried the chat feature. The chat customer service rep was finally able to explain (after I sent him the link for the offer) that I could not combine the two offers- 6th months free Kindle Unlimited and the trade-in. This should have been made clear when I ordered the device. Although I love my device, Amazon did a poor job explaining the fine print and attempting to understand and resolve my problem."
Jordan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an avid reader, and originally I had a 2014 kindle, and it still works well, but the battery life was no longer what it used to be. I would have to recharge it every night. The most important feature in a kindle for me, is the fact that I can read anywhere without the glare. So with my old kindle struggling to get through a full day of reading, I decided to try the new paperwhite. And I do LOVE IT! I didn't even realize that it now comes with a backlight that lights up the screen in the dark! Now I can read anywhere at any time. During the day, during the night, read EVERYWHERE! My only criticism is that it advertises ""weeks"" of battery life, and that may be true, if you never use it. That being said, it is still a good battery. Even with my constant reading I am getting approximately 3 days on one charge, which no matter what beats the 20ish hours on my old one.
Oh yea, the Audible thing is cool too, but lets face it, I bought a kindle paperwhite so that I could read my books."
Linda K,4.0 out of 5 stars,This kindle is an upgrade from a refurbished 2016 model. The screen is a whiter shade which I found easier on my eyes. I also read on an iPad which has a whiter screen. The software is the same and still contains a bug or two but nothing bad. The battery life is not as good. I can read over two hours a day if I’m into a good book so I can really drain the battery. It was on sale when I purchased. It’s worth the upgrade if you read a lot. The waterproof screen feels nice and smooth to touch with quick page turns. I haven’t had a chance to test the waterproof element although it’s gotten splashed and was easy to clean. It doesn’t seem to hold finger smudges.
Inkish Kingdoms,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This device is simply perfect and for the money it is totally worth it! I only connect it to WiFi when I need a new book and that is it! Easy to use long battery, even has Bluetooth for audiobooks. Light to carry around and there is nothing like carrying your library with you! I wish I had waited to buy one with a different color haha"
STEPHANIE L.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you’re buying this because it has Audible, save your money!! It has NO timer so cannot play before bed. In addition, there are NO names of chapters like on my iPhone, so if your book has some meditations in it, you will have NO idea which chapter to select!! Also, there is no earphone port , so you need wireless. When using a wireless speaker, it does not automatically reconnect even when it’s on. Every time you must click on settings TWICE, turn it off and then back on! Just very tedious to use and NOT user friendly. Would NOT recommend!"
laney Starberry,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll probably keep my Kindle Paperwhite 10 because I can sit in the sun and read and it's very light, but when it comes to reading fast and easy my Fire HD 8 ROCKS. They added scrolling reading. You just keep reading down the page and scrolling. So fast. The lighting and fonts are clearer as well on my Fire HD. If I want to read the book titles on the front page in the Paperwhite, I have to have a good lamp. Yes, the Fire Hd is heavier but wow, easy reading makes up for it. What also is better is seeing the book covers of the books I own and am reading. As you've probably realized, my eyesight isn't the best, but the colors and vivid contrast in the Fire HD 8 make everything so clear and beautiful. While I'm not so thrilled with the tablet features, they're available. If i could only afford one kindle and spent a lot of time reading in the sun, I'd go with the Paperwhite 10, but otherwise, I'd choose my Fire HD tablet. Wow! It's so versatile. In the photos, The Fire HD is on the left and Paperwhite on the right."
Queen of Giants,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took me a bit to adjust to this after using a tablet. It felt a little glitchy but that wasn't the case at all. I just had ti remind myself that it was NOT my tablet! I love this kindle paperwhite. I would like it to be just a bit bigger, but the light is good, I can read anywhere at any time. It's lightweight and I can get comfortable with it in bed. I've had it for almost 2 months now and I've charged it three times. I use it every day! I am very happy with this and I recommend it to anyone who loves to read as much as I do!"
Reader,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from the last version and like it a lot more. The shape is more comfortable to hold, the display looks cleaner and crisper (placebo?), night mode is excellent (thought it would be nice if an update made it so you could toggle it on and off in two or three clicks instead of nine or ten.) I also prefer the flush front panel, no edges to catch dust or lint. Nice to know it's waterproof too! Battery life might be slightly less, but plenty if you keep it in airplane mode."
historicalficlover,4.0 out of 5 stars,I really love my Kindle Paperwhite. I love the built-in light and it’s so light to hold. My last Kindle was nine years old and still going. My only problem is with battery life. In the description it stated a charge lasted for weeks. I have recharged mine three times in 2 1/2 weeks. I have not checked to see if it is waterproof and probably won’t but it’s nice to know if you spill something on it. Also I did not have any difficulty with the charging cable as others have noted. It fit perfectly.
WindowKitty14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"**UPDATE** After I posted this review, an Amazon representative got in touch and suggested I try rebooting the Kindle, which I did, and so far, so good! It's now keeping charge very well. I'm going to leave my original review in case anyone has a similar problem, so you'll know what to try: ""I bought this as a Christmas present to myself and it worked really well at first. I do like the lighting. But after about a month, the battery stopped keeping charge. After being charged to 100% at night, it would be down to 15% the next morning - and this happened several times. Unfortunately I'm not in a position to return it, so am stuck with this expensive reader that I can't take anywhere, and actually can't even use at home unless it's plugged in. It's possible of course that it's just this one ... but for anyone considering it, just make sure you're able to return it before you buy."""
Brian C,3.0 out of 5 stars,This is my fifth kindle. I love kindle but this one didn’t download whether I read the books in my library by showing percentages. After calling the representative told me to look at each book and then download each one separately at which point I would find out whether I did in fact read the book already. Let me just say there were a good number of pages with read and unread books in them. It ended up downloading (after doing that) backwards so that the oldest read books came up closest to me and the newest being further away. On the front page or home page my oldest books appear verses the ones I might want to read next that I recently bought. I am not happy. It is a real pain in the neck to find what I want to read.
Lmhaam,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Somewhat disappointed that I cannot set the time to ‘local’. Even after talking with Amazon customer service it seems the only time available is ‘military’ not AM/PM. Also, I’m having a problem with settings holding. I set it to tell me the ‘time to end of chapter’ but it keeps going back to ‘time to end of book’. Can’t seem to ‘save’ it! Haven’t tried to read in the sun yet - guess that will have to wait til summer. I sure hope I can give a good review then! Other then that I like having a lighted background where my previous kindle did not."
Carouselfriend,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The books on my old kindle are available but when I select one, it has to download individually to my new one. I would rather have all the books download to the new one and get rid of the old one, but I don’t know how to do that. I don’t have any interest in good reads but don’t know how to get rid of that either. The new kindle is about 1/16 of an inch smaller than my old one, so the old cover doesn’t work - kindle falls out - so I had to buy a new cover. The paper white itself is great. The tool bar takes some getting used to."
SPK,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The screen is great. The home screen is re-structured so that it is more difficult to search your own books. But of course easier to see the new books for sale. If you used text to speech, That functionality has been hobbled so that you will have to spend extra money on Audible books. The optional speaker dongle is very difficult to use. If you pair Bluetooth headphones, the voice quality has been reduced so that it does not flow as well. If the previous versions were still available, I would have preferred to buy that one.."
Cherilyn J Cleveland,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had my last Kindle Paperwhite for about 6 years. It has traveled with me everywhere and I decided to upgrade after my dog knicked the screen. To be honest I am surprised my last one lasted so long because I have spilled and dropped it many times. I am really happy for the waterproof aspect of the new kindle and with kids around this feature is a blessing. I read a lot and I travel for work so this is an incredible device. The upgrade moves faster when turning pages and is so brighter. The battery life is incredible and even with as much as I read I don't have to charge it that often. I recommend the kindle paperwhite to every reader I meet. Best thing ever invented.
B. Mohr,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They just die and can't be revived. Fortunately Amazon knows what I purchased and I can re-download. But then there's another trick, completely loosing the book I was reading. I have to download that once more and laboriously find my place. Not easy when it's ""50 Classic Sea Books"" treated as one volume. As well, I'll second the poor battery life review. I plug mine in every night just like my phone. Now, the reader works flawlessly on my Ipad but that doesn't fit in my jacket pocket, as I like to read while I stand in line for groceries or whatever in virus world. I guess I'll just keep buying new ones."
Andrew Muniz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been working to disconnect myself from my phone and I wanted to get back into reading. I was on the fence another whether to use the kindle app on an iPhone/iPad or get a paper white. I finally decided to go with it and now there is no looking back!

The difference it makes on my eyes is amazing and it has renewed my love of reading. Not having notifications or distractions pop up helps keep me focused on my reading.

I get some of the negative reviews but I had ZERO issues with my paper white. It worked right off the box and I was up and reading in less than 5 minutes.

The size is perfect the system is seamless.

If you are looking at this and trying to decide if you should go with it... go for it."
L. Cat,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bluetooth failure - Amazon did not test before selling and sells a device that connects but connection needs to be re-established every time you turn on kindle. Endless frustration for me. Has worked 2 x in 45 days . While I started to work w Amazon service before return cut off . Then, kept working w them trying to get it to function and now it’s too late.

It puts me through an endless loop of unsuccessful connections. I set my Beats device blinking to connect directly on kindle and it’s still searching for it. ‘Make sure your device is on ‘

I upgraded to use audible and turned in my perfectly functional old kindle w a snappy off on switch. Now my dilemma is to turn in via warranty for refurbished (only option ) OR keep this one and only do audible w my iPad that automatically connects w Bluetooth w/out a song n dance.

UPDATE 9.19.19

I remembered customer service asked specially if I was using a Bluetooth headset w voice capability, I was at the time. Then yesterday I found an old Motorola 305 in a drawer, I recharged it and on the first try — AMAZING - it connected. Today I tried again to connect spending about 15 minutes and was only frustrated. Will try again tomorrow..."
Colorado Cowgirl,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third paperwhite. I was very excited about the new features like Audible and waterproof. However in less than a month I was having problems with no battery life and had to reset it ( wipe out everything on it) to get battery life, after 2 days with tech. support from some foreign country. I am very concerned!"
Joni Petrillo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bout the paper white to replace my old touch screen kindle. The paper white has a nice readable display but the entire front of the display is very sensitive even along the edges so I am constantly jumping back and forward while I read. It also is difficult to turn off and on with a three step process to turn on and a four step process to turn off.
My original kindle was much more user friendly. Maybe when I figure out how to hold the paper white without constantly jumping pages I will enjoy it more. Until then it has been a real inconvenient device."
JCArcht,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This replaces my old Kindle- which was one of the original Kindles. I like the page turning by just touching the right side of the screen. I like the back light which allows me to read in dimly lit conditions. The wi-fi interface works well, in general. I have to remember to turn it off while reading a book, otherwise the prompt to restart or power off comes on sporadically, interrupting my reading. The settings have great flexibility with font sizes. The reading surface is very customizable. I recommend the Paperwhite."
Ujjwal Thapa,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Kindle. The one device I was hesitant to buy for atleast 2 years with only one reason because I love paperbook. I have read about two short books so far. Really like the options it provided like dictionary. This device is really light land I have been using it for my train commute every morning
Asia Kelly,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a big book person, I love the feel of them I love the pages. That being said, I am also a bit hard of seeing, and I am completely lazy in finding large print books. I've also been having the issue of ruining books by carrying them everywhere. I purchased a kindle so that I could fit the font of any book to what suits me, and in addition be able to carry a book with me without destroying it. I have to say it was a good choice. I love it, it is very easy to work and has all the features one would need. I purchased the 32gb. I have 5 books and still have close to 28gb left, I dont know if that is helpful but the info is there. I have used it in the bath and although I didnt submerge it (not recommended) it did fine with water on the screen."
Lisa,3.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I didn’t want a kindle as bad as I do with as much space as this one has or I’d buy the kindle that has speakers and plays an audiobook as you read. That is my biggest issue here is that I can’t read and listen at the same time. It’s really annoying to pay so much for something that doesn’t do what you’d think it would since a previous version of the kindle did have that feature. The touch screen is not bad but not that good since it stops and freezes and takes a while to scroll or browse the store. Biggest issue is the not being able to play the book as I read it since I really like doing both at once.
F. Herrera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Kindle is a litter smaller than the very old one I had. This makes it a little lighter in weight. Everything is touch screen. No more buttons for turning the pages. I personally liked the turn buttons. But not a big deal. I still do not know why they still do not use page numbers for each novel, but oh well. The book mark seems to work well. I like the new brightness of the paperwhite screen. The only negative is that I had to buy a new cover. I liked my old cover because it was leather. But you can find cheap covers on Amazon for the new Kindle."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything I expected except for one thing: In my previous Kindles (I've had 3 or 4) when I ordered a book, it specified whether I had already ordered and read the book. It no longer does this. As a result, I've ordered two books that I had read a long time ago."
Paula Penariu,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new Kindle. I only give it a 4 star because I had been using the Kindle app on both my iPhone and my iPad prior to purchasing. I read voraciously and love seeing the book covers in their glory. The Kindle just doesn't offer what the i products do, but after a while, you get used to it.

One unexpected thing was the connectivity and speed. It's a bit slow in how it progresses through the pages and does the tasks you want it to do. But, again, had I now been used to a different product, I would have thought the Kindle rocks and given it 5 stars.

Last thought, I am one of those people who enjoys holding up the Kindle from the bottom. I accidentally turned it off a couple of times, so that instinct had to be stifled a bit. Will buy a supporting/origami cover so the kindle can support itself upright on a flat surface."
Allie King,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I am very happy with my purchase. I have never owned a Kindle before and this was a great buy ! I love that I can check out library books on my phone and have them delivered to my Kindle. The battery life has been great so far, I got my Kindle on June 12th I fully charged it and I still had 39% June 19th. I love that I can change all the settings to how I prefer them and the sign in password is fantastic so my kiddos don't buy anything. It's light weight and so easy to use. I am very satisfied with my purchase and love that I can just pic up a book and read whenever and wherever."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a new Kindle for me. My old one just wore itself out after maybe 10 or more years.
The touch screen on the Paperwhite for me can be a little too sensitive and I easily lose your page. Possibly with time I will be accustomed to it.
I like the buttons on my last kindle to turn it on and off and turn pages. I don't miss the keyboard from previous edition.
This new Kindle is easier to read than my old one and I am still getting accustomed to searching for books in my library of 300+ books. Change is tough."
Elkhunter,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If all you want to do is read books, this product is fine. You can do everything this reader does on your cell phone already. It is hard to use, black and white screen, jerky motion, battery life is better than a cell phone, but not what is advertised. The special offers that are made are not worth anything. You get an ""experimental browser"". Not sure why I have to pay for something that is experimental. It automatically down loads ""suggested"" books for you to read, then they are very difficult to get rid of, some I never could get rid of. It has lots of cool sounding features that are of no use to an average reader, maybe in some special cases only. I read the 53 page instruction book that came with it. The operating system is not intuitive, not like windows or any other operating system. You have to start from scratch to learn your way around it. The screen is too small. I spent $200 on the device, a charge and power cord ( no, they do not come with it) and a supossedly leather cover. Not sure what good it is without a charger, but you have to pay extra for that. I would say total value of all items was less than $50 and I am being generous at that. I kept it a few days past the 30 day return period because I was struggling trying to learn to make it work. Finally gave up. Amazon agreed to let me return it, but said I could only ""ask"" for a refund after they got it back. Not sure why anyone would want to return something without getting a refund. I have it in writing so I will see what happens.

Very disappointed in this purchase. I buy lots of stuff from Amazon and don't usually ever have any problems. They need to drop this item from their product line. No one would keep it after paying this kind of money."
Erin Mc,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using kindle for about 8 yrs now but for Christmas I received a Kindle Paperwhite. I love it. it’s so lightweight I hardly know it’s in my pocketbook. I love the features. I don’t know anything about any of the other new generations of kindle, but I’d recommend the paperwhite"
fishonareef,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The reverse lighting (black background with white letters) decided to quit working all of a sudden after only one month. The pages would layer and some of the text was black and some was white and it was just a scrambled mess. It did work in the regular configuration, though (white background with black letters). It took quite a bit of time for me to figure out how to get help. I was able to chat with customer service on the web and he ran me through a factory reset and troubleshoot to no avail. He did authorize a replacement with 2-day shipping, so a happy ending!"
Margie from Florida,3.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Kindle but this version doesn't hold the power as long. When it starts getting low too quickly you have to reset to factory settings and the books you may have had on there ready to read goes back to my cloud account with Amazon. Then i have to find them all over again. I have about 230 books right now so it's a pain
Norma Conner,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The main reason I ordered the new Kindle was because of the longer battery life, but this one doesn't even stay charged as long as my old one did. It was advertised to stay hold a charge for weeks instead of days but I have to charge mine every couple of days! I am very disappointed in it for that reason, every thing else about it works well!"
sm,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this as a gift from my husband. The device itself is fine if a little clunky to use, and it seems to run through battery pretty fast (4% battery capacity used in < 20 minutes, which is a little alarming for something that claims ""a single charge lasts weeks"".) Because the device came with the ""special offers"" option on the purchase, I had to pay $20 plus tax to remove ads. Something my husband never realized because of how misleading Amazon is. Amazon's characterizing ads as a ""special offer"" and placing the description of what ""special offers"" means well below the ""special offers"" choice (in fact below two more settings choices and in small font) is deceptive and unethical."
Photogal,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like that the Kindle paperwhite is easy to read. My last Kindle had the gray backround and was not as easy on the eyes. I also like the touch screen, although it takes some getting used to as it is too touchy at times but at other times, needs to be touched over and over to move along. The night light is awesome. The battery doesn't last weeks; only about one week but it's not a big deal."
Love to read!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love reading on a Kindle. I don't know why but this never bothered me before, but why oh why does the power button have to be on the bottom right? I am constantly turning the device off by accident. It also shuts off when I prop it up to read (like on the shelf of the elliptical machine). It has been extremely frustrating! The only solution I can come up with is to buy a cover, but then I can't get it wet which is the whole reason I bought this one. Super frustrating. Amazon... Please fix this annoying problem!"
Jayhawk94,3.0 out of 5 stars,Holy crap they make this hard. One would think that if you buy a Kindle in December of 2019 you'd get the 2019 release! I'm now having to return the THIRD case in a row. I'm finally cross checking the serial number of the device against a Wikipedia database (no where on my Amazon order does it say this is the 2018 release) to find that this is not the 2019 release. Grrrr.
eve,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had several kindles in the past and this is the only one that have had so many glitches at just 6 months old. What's even more frustrating is trying to deal with getting a replacement. I've had to call 8X because the first call (factory reboot) didn't work. 2nd call, the rep said she'll send me a link for return label. She didn't send me an email. 3rd call, guy was fantastic only I didn't get the very long password to input for the return label. Also, 4 instant calls would not go through to a live person and finally, on my 8th(?) call, I had to use the toll free # and spoke to Eric who was nice enough to fix my link and gave me the password but, he already had my return label ready to go. Thank you for that! Finally, not really thrilled to get a replacement kindle because when I checked on my order list, I found out that I will be receiving a REFURBISHED kindle!"
lindak,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing to dislike; the Paper White is well designed for its purpose, reading books; that is all it does and why it is simple to operate. The screen is lighted from the front by a sheet that is like a flat optical fiber rather than back lighted like a phone of tablet. I can read it is the sun light of with the home brightly lit. the illumination is adjustable; brighten it during the day dim it at night for reading with out a lamp on. I have worn out three paperwhites and am now on my 4th, they actually last a long time; I use mine every day."
Amanda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned an earlier Kindle model, but wanted to upgrade because mine did not have a light, and could therefore not be used in the dark. I was debating between this Kindle (paperwhite) vs. the latest basic Kindle model. I decided to go with the Paperwhite solely because I heard the Paperwhite had a feature that would invert the colors so that a white page with black text would become a black page with white text. I routinely struggle with light sensitivity, and was hoping that inverting the color would result in less light than the traditional white background / black text. After receiving my Kindle I feel I can definitely say that is the case. The black background / white text on the no light setting (which still gives off enough light to read in the dark) is less bright than the white background / black text on the lowest light setting. So if you’re looking for a Kindle that will help with light sensitivity, the Paperwhite is an excellent option. That being said, if you are only expecting to read in well lit areas, the white background / black text on the no light setting is less bright than the black background / white text no light setting. However, unlike the black background / white text on the no light setting, you cannot read in the dark with the white background / black text on the no light setting. So if you are sensitive to light, and expect to do any Kindle reading in the dark, I would definitely suggest the Paperwhite.

My only complaint about the Paperwhite is that changing the brightness of the Kindle is very simply done, but inverting the colors takes several more steps because it is categorized under the “Accessibility” settings. Essentially it comes down to you can change the brightness with 4 taps, but inverting the color takes 8 taps. I wouldn’t say that’s inconvenient enough for my overall opinion on the Kindle to change, but considering the two adjustments seem to be in a similar category, it would seem logical to me to put their controls in the same place.

Having had the opportunity to use the Kindle for a couple weeks, I can say that it is clearly better than traditional screens for those with light sensitivity. If I’ve been reading my kindle for 10 minutes with the black background / white text on the no light setting, even glance at my phone while it’s on it’s lowest light setting comparatively feels like I’m being blinded with light. Overall, I love this Kindle!"
Jes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this Kindle Paperwhite. I had a much older Paperwhite a few years ago and I enjoyed it. It feels pretty similar and still functions very well as a book. I absolutely did NOT want a tablet, just an E-reader and this functions in that capacity perfectly.

The battery life in the Paperwhite is absolutely phenomenal. I am currently 1 Month into a charge and am at 24% with what I consider to be pretty heavy use. Also the screen is very easy on your eyes and the adjustable backlighting is very helpful for reading day or night, high or low light.

If I had to give this reader some constructive criticism I have to say that the page navigation is pretty slow when it comes to the e-readers responsiveness to touch. It is delayed anytime I navigate between pages or menus. This was a similar problem I had on the older version as well. However, this is not a tablet, so blazing fast response isn’t absolutely necessary.

Overall great e-reader. Outstanding battery life. Great screen. Great functionality. I do not regret it at all and will definitely buy another when the time comes."
PCT,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well I haven't dropped my new Kindle into the bathtub or pool - yet. So I can't comment on that. However I can tell you that I love it overall. I have more storage for quick access to books I've downloaded. The screen is very responsive to page turns, bookmarks, searches, etc. Charging seems to take no time at all!
My only disappointment is the LED backlight. In my previous Paperwhite I thought something was wrong as the pages seemed to be getting darker, and I had to crank up the light. Unfortunately this new one is the same . The LEDs are dim unless you go to 14 to start with. Why is that??
Still, this is a wonderful product that brings me much enjoyment."
judy kay stahly,4.0 out of 5 stars,"my only disappointment is that I can't remove books I've read back into the cloud. They are all on my kindle and I have to go through all them to find my next book. Being an avid reader that means I have 2000 books in my cloud, which are now on my kindle. With my old kindle I had 1700 in the cloud & 300 on kindle, much better."
Alex,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to this from the Kindle version that was new in like 2010 or something. It has such a great battery life, and the light settings cover everything I would need.
I will say there's a bit of a learning curve (at least for me). The lists and navigation aren't very intuitive, even after I [actually] read the manual. I'm able to access the book I'm currently reading (which is like 99.9% of what I want it to do anyway) but can't quite figure out how to browse or save books that interest me for later, etc... at least, not yet."
Regan W,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was using Samsung tablet to read at night. I was able to turn the light down on it but never enough. My eye doctor recommended that I switch to an e reader (I am 42 and just now started to need glasses to read). I compared others and went with this one instead of nook or others but mostly because the majority of my e books were on Kindle (and I also have Kindle unlimited) and these would not work on Nook (Nook app does not work on Kindle either). There is a way to do it but it takes downloading things to a computer, changing the format, and reloading on Kindle (or Nook). That just seemed like a lot of work for me. Anyway, this e reader works very well with my only complaint being that you can't change to Sepia, Black, or other shaded reading at night but I am not sure that would even be possible with the concept of the paperwhite and how it works.
Happy Reading!"
Gregory B. Davis,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle (actually, fourth if you count the one I sat on and broke) and it's my least favorite. Ok, maybe it has new technology and is waterproof, but if you're just looking for a good E-reader, maybe look at another model. The most annoying thing is that it is so sensitive, it automatically turns multiple pages at a time when I'm just holding it with my right hand. So right in the middle of reading, it turns pages...very annoying. The customer service rep suggested I restart it which I did...nothing changed."
Tattyy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the small size -- it's like reading a paperback book, just lighter! The screen is nonglare. I just wish it were an inch wider -- right now, it's too wide to hold comfortably with one hand anyway! I opted for the larger GB size, but may not need it... The format is black and shades of gray, like a paperback book! The only books I won't be putting on there are medical references, since color is kinda required for some illustrations, but the screen size would be kinda small for that anyway! I like that it is waterproof, as my backpack isn't... and I can take it backpacking/trekking...."
erpa,2.0 out of 5 stars,"really no reason to upgrade. boots up much slower, screen seems dimmer than last gen pw on equal settings .. more red too. unless one needs the bluetooth capability(and more memory) they probably won't see this as an upgrade.. (i don't need and haven't tried the bt yet). also, as others have noted, battery life does seem less...no quantitative test here tho. it works, but the performance and quality, in a way, actually (except for the bt capability/memory) seem like a down grade."
Cassandra Suever,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my Kindle Paperwhite for over a year now, and have never been more compelled to write a review until a certain incident involving an adventurous toddler made me realize just how durable this product really is. But more on that in a moment.

I’ll start with the basics. I bought this as a gift to myself (and my eyes) after Christmas 2018. I had always used the Kindle app on my iPhone, and figured it was time to take the full leap and commit to an e-reader by taking advantage of a sale price. I have kids, so the waterproof feature was the one that made the decision for me. Spills come with the territory of parenthood.

I could go on and on about all of the features I love with this product, but I’m sure they’ve been discussed in other reviews. I do want to share this, though. This Kindle is durable. Its screen can withstand 5 seconds* of roughly 30 pounds of toddler weight directly on top of the screen while standing on a hard surface (i.e an end table) without damage. It can also withstand drops from a countertop height with no damage. This thing is a book-loving toddler parent’s dream**

Additional benefits of having this Kindle and a toddler in the same location:
- No torn pages or book jackets
- It can change to dark mode (under accessibility options), so you can read in the dark while having a nighttime standoff over whether your toddler will actually decide to sleep
- A password protected unlock option allows you to keep your place much better than a bookmark, which can be removed and hidden somewhere around the house like a twisted scavenger hunt
-Password option also helps prevent unwanted purchases from an unsupervised child who has found the Kindle store

Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this Kindle to anyone, based on its durability alone.

*Time is an estimate, based on how long it took me to cross the room when I noticed this new trick he was performing and removed him from the screen.

** These assertions have not been approved by Amazon, they’re simply my observations from life with a rambunctious toddler. Please do not test these out for yourself. I cannot guarantee that your experience will be the same."
Shane,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had the last paperwhite for years and read dozens of books on it. It's traveled the world with me and continues to be a staple in my pack, whether across the town or country. All the things I loved about my old one seemed to be improved with this one... size, battery life, display quality and durability. Reading on beaches or poolside always left me a little worried so the waterproof feature was also a huge selling point. As one of my couple key travel items I thought why not upgrade. But after two weeks I'm sending it back and hanging onto my older paperwhite. I don't write a lot of reviews but for those of you torn about upgrading here's my main two points for returning:

1) Display quality. This is the main reason for the return. Having both paperwhites side by side I just can't get with the newer screen. I LOVE the offwhite almost sephia tone of kindles. Its the sole reason you can read for hours outside without strain. And while the new one isn't exactly an iPad, its definitely whiter and brighter. Plus the edges are now flush with the screen - giving them a glossy look. Sure it's sleeker but now you have so much more glare and smudges (which in turn reflect even more glare).

2) Battery life. A lot of people mentioned it and its true, this one definitely dies faster. Granted we're still talking weeks of battery life (on airplane mode) but I'm not going to upgrade to a device that just doesn't last a long.

I still give it a good rating because if you havent had a kindle before or don't have one to side by side compare you probably won't even notice those changes. The screen and battery are still great - just not as good as the last gen. And while the waterproof is a great feature it doesn't outweigh the core reasons I own a kindle; a paper like screen and amazing battery life.

Anyways, hope this helps my fellow kindle readers!"
Joe Feline,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first edition Kindle is on its last leg so I searched for a replacement that has a long battery life, easy to operate, and could comfortably and easily fit in any of my purses so I'd have something to read while waiting in my doctors' office, or to meet a friend who is late for lunch. This Kindle does have a long battery life and fits in whatever purse I am using. It is easy to read, easy to operate, and holds my entire enormous Kindle library with enough storage capacity for additional books. I love my first edition Kindle, but I love this new Kindle even more."
Pem,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The inverted color mode is my favorite feature of this device. White text on a black background is a lot easier on my eyes than black text on a white background. Not to mention it emits a lot less light, which is less likely to disturb others around you.

I've read other reviews that have complained about the battery life - I have noticed the battery drains faster than I would like (especially after turning on WiFi and getting a lot of books suddenly uploaded to my device), but I've found it hasn't been too much of an issue and the battery can still last a long time with a half hour or so of daily use."
hlmh,1.0 out of 5 stars,I have not even opened my Kindle Paperwhite that I received for Christmas due an illness in my family. Getting ready to open it today on Jan 27th. So I lost out on 2 months of the free kindle book subscription. It seems like it would be a really wonderful thing if Amazon made it so the recipient of the kindle could start they own free month subscription to the kindle books when they wanted to start using it. Makes me start out using my new 1st ever kindle with a bad taste in my mouth for the gift. Called today to see if that could be done and was told nope. Such a bummer.
Barrett Hansen,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I now split my time between my older paperwhite with pinhole spots from scratches on the screen and this new one because it is nearly impossible to move to footnotes from text or back again. So I use the older one for non-fiction or fiction with lots of footnotes and this one is just for fiction. I'm disappointed because the old one works perfectly, the screen just had some distracting damage, but I suspect I paid nearly the same amount for both. How does a really good product change into a not-as-good product, even if it is waterproof?"
A. H. Wells,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so disappointed that my Kindle has to be charged every two or three days when it is advertised as lasting for ""weeks."" I've already sent back a Kindle Fire for the same reason. I guess I'll keep this one and just charge it every night, but I do hate it!"
Ryan&Kerrie,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased right around launch. I used it for a year and it WAS great, but a few days outside of warranty it quit accepting a charge. I contacted customer service and all they would do was offer me a small 15% discount on purchasing a new device. It's very unfortunate that they wouldn't do anything else for me. I use the device often and take very good care of it. When you purchase a device, you expect it to last more than a year. I don't think I'll be ever purchasing a Kindle again and will most likely buy a Barnes and Noble Nook as my previous Nook lasted almost five years."
Big Pa,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle Paperwhite version 10 was a huge disappointment for me. My experience was vastly inferior to the Kindle app on iPad Mini. I liked the waterproof design and longer battery life. But I can't put up with laggy, flickering touch screen. And the 'Experimental Browser"" reveals how far Paperwhite has to go rather than how far it has come. Sure the iPad costs more but it also does much more. Carrying an iPad with an Anker battery pack weighs a few ounces more but a much better solution for me. Returning the Paperwhite."
David N. Boyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seems to be a little more customize-able, responsive and lighter than my older Paperwhite. I like being able to see what time it is while I'm reading without clicking the bar at the top of the page on and off (can put the time in small print at the top of the page). Not quite the season to try it in the pool yet to try out how waterproof it is, but looking forward to being able to read while soaking. I also like having the ability to connect it to bluetooth, store and listen to Audible books. Nice upgrade after I started having a small screen problem on my 6 year old Paperwhite."
sforwood,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am on my 5th or 6th Kindle over a period of many years. It is one of my very most prized possessions. Fortunately, I have not had to rate the waterproof feature of my Kindle (and hopefully never will), and I have not had it long enough to rate the battery life. But my overall rating of a Kindle Paperwhite is 5-stars, plus! For my friends who tell me that they don't want one because they like the ""feel of a real book"" in their hands, they just don't know what they're missing. I travel extensively, and it's a wonderful security blanket to have an entire library of new books in my purse! I also have a Kindle app on my tablet, but it doesn't compare to the backlight on the Kindle. I can also read anywhere with any any type of lighting - bright sunlight or night lights."
Zorro Publishing House,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from Paperwhite 7th generation to Paperwhite 10th generation to have the benefit of Bluetooth connection for my headset or to play on my speakers, for Audible selections. That is a nice feature to have. Most other functions are identical to the earlier generation.

But the battery life drops significantly, even in one afternoon of reading, it drops from 100% to 30%, even with Bluetooth and Wifi turned off. So I will continue to use the product for a few weeks and will update the review here if the battery life improves during the break-in period.

The second reason for the low score is that the screen back-lighting is dimmer than the previous model. So for example I have to run it at 18 instead of 14 in the same lighting. Possibly this also impacts the battery life.

The current software version seems to be a little buggy, and hopefully that will be updated soon.

The waterproof screen is not important to me but is nice to know the product is sealed."
catsrus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second kindle - could not be without it.....somehow I thought its battery would last longer between charges. Guess I spend more time on it than I think.
11/24/19 After many months use - I do not like that the screen covers the complete front surface.. There is no place to hold it without automatically switching pages forward or backward. My original kindle had a non active perimeter all around the screen that made it easier to hold. Yes it has many updated features but the full screen is a distraction. This feature is on my Microsoft Surface Pro also and I have to be very careful where I touch it."
JB,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a loyal Kindle user. This was my second Paperwhite. For a while my only complaint was the increased fingerprint smudging at the edges until recently when the Kindle locked up while I was reading and the touch screen wouldn't respond. I have a Kindle ereader as well, without a light, and that one has never given me any trouble. It is also easier to read on; I found that overall the e-ink resolution on the Paperwhite was lighter, and a little harder to read, but overlooked this since I could read on it at night, I just had to bold the text. However, I was very disappointed by the touchscreen lockup, so I traded in the Paperwhite device for a new Kindle ereader. As someone who likes to read ebooks for convenience but also for study and note taking on the Kindle, I hope my new device performs better."
MysticalRose,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle and always have it in my purse wherever I go - there is no telling if I'm going to stand or sit and wait for anything. But if I did, I have something to read!
I traded my other Kindle Paperwhite for this new version and except for more storage (8Gb instead of 4GB), I really can't tell much difference. It is also a little smaller than the previous paperwhite version, so my cases ( I have 3) will not fit this one and I just don't want to pay $40.00 for a new case!
I have not tried the audible yet. I did try to load some fonts in it, but I don't see them anywhere When I open the fonts section, only the ones already on there is what's showing."
Jiggin Jay,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First for the like: it is lighter and will hope waterproof. The screen is easy to read and gentle on the eyes.
Now for the not to like: Sometimes it will not turn on and requires manipulations to get it to work (like it wants to update again and again). For those times when a press of the on button does get it started it has to GET STARTED. Something expected from a tablet but the Kindle Reader, Really!! The model traded in did not incur these problems.
Lighter is nice and it does feel smoother. The screen and lighting are very good. So the goods outweigh the bad for me."
Tammy Edge Patton,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my latest Kindle upgrade, but not my first Kindle. I still like everything about it, and most changes since the original have been good ones, EXCEPT.......the power button being on the bottom makes it easy to accidentally turn it off while reading (which is really annoying) and please, please please make it so the pages can be turned with either hand. Also, can you make it so at the end of each book it asks you if you would like to ""remove from device""??? THANK YOU!!! I'm still in love with ereaders though...."
Ulrich G. Weiss,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had multiple Kindle's ... I also have an old paperwhite ...
This new paperwhite is not particularly revolutionary but it is better, an upgrade to a 2.0 version.
I use my Kindle purely for reading for all other functionality I use my laptop or Kindle Fire.
The new paperwhite ... is quicker to react ( starting-up, searching through libraries, downloading books,
etc.) - lighter - the menus are sleeker, more intuitive, and has some additional functionality.
It's very good - so why is it just a 2.0, well if Amazon could have the same technology with color - that
would be revolutionary ... I don'r know if that's possible."
jules0321,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I never did really love this kindle. It was a nice screen for reading, but the touch screen just seemed so “jumpy”. Nothing about it was smooth like a phone or kindle fire. Even turning the pages seemed odd. I’d had it for 13 months and didn’t use it too often, as I actually prefer to read on my phone when the front screen with the book ad froze and it was toast. Of course, the warranty had expired a month ago so I’m just out of luck. Not sure I can spend the money on another one if that’s all the life they have in them"
Randy Ford,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The human engineering on this equipment is quite inadequate (I have a Ph.D. in HCI with 40 years of experience). I kept thinking that I would adapt, but after almost two months of heavy use, I am still ending up where I don't want to be. In addition, the stream of ads is a source of continual irritation. (Do you seriously want me to pay $20 to turn the ads off??? I paid $130 for the unit. That's the dumbest stunt Amazon has ever tried to pull.) Moreover, the unit is having diificulty holding its link to my bluetooth headset. I am about a Pro-Amazon as anyone could be. I love using Amazon for all sorts of things, but you really do need to try a little harder and be more thoughtful into your Kindle readers. I much more prefer your PC apps for this service."
-Den-,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated for Audible player. The player is bare-bones. No sleep timer. Targets in volume control are small and hard to use. Have not found a way to access all the free content that is available on my wife’s Kindle Fire. Player use seemed to greatly reduce battery life.

I upgraded from my 5th generation Paperwhite and discovered that support for my purchased Sudoku game was discontinued. The new Paperwhite is lovely for books, but the discontinued game support is disappointing..

From Amazon support: ""I'm sorry at this time Sudoku Works is not compatible with the Kindle Paperwhite (10 Gen). As of now Sudoku Works is only compatible with Previous generation Kindle Paperwhite."""
J. A. Cotton,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Have been waiting to get the new PaperWhite and boy is it disappointing! Screen very unresponsive. Touch screen almost unusable. I've followed all the directions as to troubleshooting w/o success. I called Customer Support and was -of course- connected to the Philippines where the agent spoke almost no English and was no help whatsoever. At this point, I'm going to return the gift and ask for a replacement to see if the next one will work.

Also of note and this may be just the unit I received, the Kindle does not operate at all like the Kindle Apps I have on my Windows 10 PC's/Laptop nor my iPads. Very frustrating. Page turning is difficult and VERY slow; the screen blinks changing from black on white to white on black before moving. I could go on, but I need to get on with my day.

What is Amazon thinking?

I'll update this when I receive a replacement. Hopefully, it will work!

UPDATE, Jan 2, 2019: Regarding the above, I finally was able to reach someone in customer service based in the USA. This Customer Service Rep was VERY helpful. His name is Doug and he well understood my problem. At the end of the conversation Doug reluctantly said he would have to pass my call to a ""Kindle Expert"" and that he would try and connect me with a USA based Kindle Expert. Unfortunately, I was at some point later (long wait) connected (should I say ""re-connected""?) with the Philippines call center where, I guess, all the Kindle Experts reside. I spoke with a competent rep named Nichole and she was able to help me after I got her off reading her troubleshooting guide from her screen. Subsequent to this conversation, she authorized a return/replace activity.

I've just now received the replacement Kindle PaperWhite 10th gen. Now starting it up to see if it works any better than the original. Will report back later.

---

UPDATE-2, January 3, 2019: 24 hours later and I have been trying to get this new PaperWhite to work as advertised. I can simply say: No Joy. Frankly, I'm so sorry about this as I had asked for this specific gift for some time; although, I have never owned a stand alone Kindle device - only the apps on my computers (as noted above.) This second replacement exhibits the same problems as the original one. It is very slow, the touch screen doesn't work all the time and the turning of pages and/or going to the home screen (or elsewhere) still is extremely laggy with the screen blinking, doing the white/black-> black/white bounce and taking forever. Again, this simply cannot be ""book related"" as this happens with any number of my books INCLUDING the two (2) Kindle User Guides included with the machine.

I'm now going to get back with Customer Service and request a return/refund as I just can't do this anymore.

My recommendation: If you have any type of portable device that will run the excellent Kindle APP use that. My Kindle apps all work flawlessly across all my portable devices including my iPhone. Skip the Kindle hardware as it offers nothing to the serious reading experience."
Julie Swope,4.0 out of 5 stars,I read a lot of the negative reviews but I haven’t had any real issues with my new paperwhite. I had two previous versions of the paperwhite that I traded in because they developed bright spots. The thing I like most about this new version is that I can do reverse with light text and dark background. I find reading it this way is much easier on my eyes. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that there does seem to be a slight lag or transition of the text between page turns. This was a good value as I did the trade in deal and also got it when it was $40 off.
steph,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ll start my review by saying the Kindle Paperwhite is a GREAT device for reading and storing all your books in one place. I love that you can change the light setting to adapt to where you are. When sunlight hits the kindle directly, it sort of gets this “flat” look to it where it looks like a paper book. It’s very readable in any lighting. The only issues are if the kindle is directly under the light source, and that’s when the glare becomes a tad bothersome, but it is still very muted compared to a phone/tablet screen.
I took several photos showing the highest and lowest light settings. I also had trouble figuring out how to invert the colors from white to black, so I posted pictures of how to find it in settings in case anyone else has the same issue. It’s a little annoying that I have to tap a few extra buttons to get the black screen, since I like to use that setting when reading at night, but it’s doable. One other tidbit I’m not a huge fan of is that, even on light setting 1, the light is still a bit bright for my eyes when reading at night. Having the black screen helps, but then the words are kind of bright. And in total darkness, turning off the backlight makes the screen impossible to see, so I must have the backlight on the lowest setting.
Another semi-annoying thing is the location of the lock/power button. It’s on the bottom, but it’s about the same place your fingers would go if you are holding it. I’ve only accidentally hit it a few times, but I almost never do if I hold it with my left hand.
The other part I don’t really like is the lag when you swipe or tap a button on a page. It takes a second to react, and every time you touch the screen it does a quick inversion of the colors for some reason. Now it only lasts a second before it responds to the swipe/button press, so you get used to it. I also understand that the software is different from that of a phone or tablet, so it’s not meant to respond the same way.
All in all, the Kindle Paperwhite is a very sleek device that is small, light, easy to hold, and portable. It is perfect for what it was designed to do, so the “issues” I pointed out are very inconsequential in comparison to its overall performance. I purchased my device with ads, but they are not bothersome AT ALL. The only time you see them is on your lock screen or as a strip at the bottom of the home screen. When you’re reading, it goes away. So it’s worth saving the $20. And the books they advertise might even be something you’re interested in. So I really enjoy having a place to keep all my books and take them anywhere I go. My only regret is not getting the 32 gigabyte storage so I can keep the same kindle forever :)
I rated the kindle 4 stars because of the minor flaws I pointed out that could be fixed, not due to its overall performance."
Chris Casper,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite is probably a 5-star product. I was unlucky to get a defective unit and then double-unlucky to have to deal with Amazon's customer ""service"" rep. So 3 stars and here's why:

I was never able to get the Kindle Paperwhite to connect to my wireless network. I tried rebooting the Kindle several times, I tried rebooting my router several times. I factory reset my Kindle and I factory reset my router. None of these worked.

When I contacted Amazon customer service to see if they could help, I explained all of this in the first chat entry. The rep simply copied and pasted his instructions into the chat window. The block of text ended with ""Can the customer connect to the network?"" Useless.

When I explained that I had already done those things multiple times, the rep told me to do it anyway. I told him I'd just return the Kindle. Then he told me that the warranty had expired. Without using the language I really wanted to, I calmly explained that I received the Kindle in mid-January and the return window was open through mid-February.

Then the rep told me ""I am really sorry but as I have checked the device warranty expired on Wed 20 Jan, 2021"" Yes, that's right. I couldn't return it because the warranty expired (past tense) next year.

Of course, when I went into my account to request an exchange, the only way to get one was to talk to customer service again. So I returned it for a refund and will look at alternatives to Amazon's ecosystem."
Gulliver,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third paperwhite. I bought a new one about three years ago and gave my wife my other one. This time I used the trade-in option to get my new paperwhite. I'm 77 years old and find I can read longer with far less eye strain on my paperwhite than with a book. I also go to the library and a coffee shop to read. I'm certainly never without it when I'm in a doctor's waiting room. Not every place is well lit. The backlight allows me to read anywhere with ease. I'm certain my local library thinks I've died. I haven't checked out a book in about 7 years.
I love the Kindle Paperwhite and recommend it to anyone of any age."
Shelly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought mine at Best Buy a few weeks ago. I had been struggling with wondering if I should upgrade since I already had the previous model paper white and liked it. I'm glad I did. It is noticeably lighter that the previous one and I love the flat screen. I like the lighting and can easily read for hours on it. I do notice it gets finger prints easier but I can wipe it off easily with the same wipes I use to clean my glasses, so not a problem for me. I love that it has more space to hold my books and the water proof gives me peace of mind in
case it comes in contact with water. My only thought is that I wish they had put the power button on the top left side on the back of the device. I have accidentally turned it off while holding it during some long hours of reading. Last thing is they put the kindle logo on the bottom in white. I wish they had done it in black as to not distract from reading but I find I am not noticing it as much as I did at first. I'm very glad I upgraded and truly love this newer model."
Dr. Steve,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What it is: A very lightweight, easy to hold in one hand reader for books.

What it is not: A multiple app and email hardware platform.

I bought the 32 gigabytes without ads, uhh , special offers; and after about a month now, am happy to report that it does make book reading easier and gentler on the eyes than hard copy or heavier all purpose tablet. Battery life is pretty decent if you enable the sleep while not using function.

Overall, I’ve been enjoying it for its intended purpose."
Fywdude,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, I don't plan on testing the water and dust proof, just hoping and will use in the Jacuzzi and at the beach. I had a first generation that I loved, and this one feels the same and is slightly faster. The browser is still labeled ""experimental"" and seems slightly better though I it is too hard to use if you don't have really great vision.

As far as the 2x storage goes, I had hundreds of titles on my generation one and was using less than 25%.

Also, if storage and waterproof are not important to you, keep in mind the battery life of the 10th generation is less than 1/4 of the first generation. I charged my old one monthly or less. The new one must be charged at least weekly (and why I dropped the rating from 5 to 4 stars).

If waterproof and/or dust-proof is important to you, this seems a pretty good option. If not, save yourself a lot of money and get an earlier version in good condition."
Kelly,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It works - I can read my books. If this is your first Kindle, you are in good hands:). But, similar to other reviews... I miss my older generation. This version is actually worse with the following features: 1) ""Waking Up"" the device - this now takes longer?! 2) Maybe I have been reading more, but I do not see any improvement to the battery life at all. 3) I feel that this screen is just not responsive/ precise as my prior kindle. Or, perhaps I was expecting slightly more responsiveness/ preciseness with this model. I find myself accidentally clicking into books when scrolling which rarely happened before.

The Pros: It is waterproof? Who is taking their Kindle swimming? More Space? I did not run out of Space on my prior Kindle but I understand why it is a good thing for many. I just wish these were not at the sacrifice of some of the basics.

All in all, I still devour books off of my kindle, but I do miss my older generation!

OH! One Last Tip - Amazon: Can you make buying a Kindle a little bit more Friendly? For a new buyer, it is really intimidating with what comes up if someone just types ""Kindle Paper white"" into their search screen."
sun2,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We were excited that this new Paperwhite would have the capability for Audible. HOWEVER, once we received it, we could not get audible to pair up with the kindle book text. We called Amazon, only to find out that the audible feature only runs separate and you cannot listen to audible and read along."
Daniel Hollenback,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this kindle! It has drastically improved the amount that I read. If you’re like me, and you read more often on your phone than you do on books or magazines, then you’ll enjoy reading from a kindle. It has really improved the amount that i read. I also like that I can change the text size."
T. Runyan,5.0 out of 5 stars,I debated getting this Kindle after reading some of the reviews. I am very happy and pleased that I did get it however because it performs perfectly for me. We go to the beach and have a pool and I needed something that I could use to read in full sunlight which is not something you can do with an IPAD. This Kindle is very readable during the bright sunlight and quite comfortable to read even when its dark due to the back lighting. I have had no issues with this Kindle and highly recommend it for someone who wants to read outdoors or even at night in bed.
frogpatty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth Kindle, including one Fire. The Paperwhite has all the features that I’ve ever wished for, plus a couple I didn’t even realize I desired. Best is the featherlight weight, which makes it easy to hold with one hand, either sitting or reclining. The battery life exceeds a week, and I read a lot every day. I love the ability to sort “already read” from “to be read.” The setup and usage from the first minute are totally intuitive. And the price is more than fair; no hidden extras to buy; three months free introductory Kindle Unlimited."
black94,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Received this a couple days ago and the screen immediately displayed about 3 dead pixels. Very prominent and highly distracting pin hole lights that make the viewing experience very difficult to tolerate, especially since the whole point of getting this was to diminish the eye irritation caused by prolonged usage of my smart phone for reading.

I was really hoping that this could replace my iPhone and iPad as my dedicated reading device.

I have reached out to customer support and am awaiting their response on this matter, but so far I am very disappointed with the quality control on this item. I expected that paying top dollar for the fully featured, highest capacity with no special offers model would mean that Amazon would care enough to send something that works.

I have documentation/video/and photo.

I have attempted all troubleshooting methods recommended via official Amazon support channels (within the scope of Amazon’s own user agreement and usage policies) and have not been able to fix this issue.

My review may change depending on how this return/replacement process goes. I will post updates on that process here."
Nancy H.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Dissatisfied with the product. Only purchased out of convenience. With today's technology, the book covers should be in color. I can read, and have been reading on my phone and iPad. Battery life is somewhat better than the afformentioed but as far as reading without WiFi, that's doable. Main reason I purchased this unit was to minimize my exposure to cancer. I wish I had not purchased but my credentials are on my Kindle now and don't feel comfortable returning. I've changed my mind. I do like this unit."
Maria Beradino,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got this one end of October, No issues so far. Had to replace my last one because the usb port somehow broke... Glad it did, The battery life on this one is so much better, I read a new book every 2 days (mostly) and I don't have to charge for days, even with the light on bright.
Amazon customer service made it monkey proof to switch to the new one also. All was done via live chat.
I have to get used to the touch screen though, Its a bit sensitive and shuts down if I touch it in the wrong place while reading."
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my 4th Kindle, a paperwhite, since the previous one was frozen. There was no fix for this previous e-reader product. I was told that the new one was 3G, which it is not. You can only download a book with WiFi or if you use a pad or your phone with 3G or 4G. Also, you cannot remove a book from the device if it is in a folder. One would need to delete the entire folder from the device. I was given false information regarding the 3G or lack of it, one either removes all or none of the items in the folder from the device. It appears that the software used is outdated and that customer service definitely needs correct info on the products.
Aside from that, it is lightweight, easy to read, as always."
Jessie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never been an avid reader, I'm generally too busy, but there are a couple of books I have been wanting to read. I had Amazon store credit, and the Kindles were on sale for Amazon Prime Day, so I decided to give it a shot. Ever since I have received my Kindle, I have not been able to put it down. I finally finished a book within a day and a half that I had started and restarted at least three times with the physical copy. When I'm not reading, I find myself scrolling through the goodreads app, discovering books I would like to read, including many books I have seen in the past that I found interesting, and adding them to my wishlist. I have only owned my Kindle for a short time, and I cannot vouch for its ability to withstand water (I'm too nervous to give it a dunk), but I will say I have been inspired to start reading again, something I never thought I would find from an electronic reading device.

As far as functionality, the backlight is easy to adjust to an appropriate setting for the environment. it comes in a very small box, it almost seems like the Kindle will be too tiny to read, but it's a perfect size to fit in my petite-ish hands and is very lightweight. The power cord is not very long, but the battery life hasn't dipped below 80% while I'm reading or browsing for hours. Even if you would like to read while it is plugged in, the plug is not in an obnoxious spot, so the Kindle can still be held comfortably. The Kindle itself is sturdy and the back is very soft, I don't even want to put a cover on it.

I am very pleased with my Kindle purchase, more-so than I had anticipated. For avid readers, I definitely recommend. For those like me, who have difficulty finding time to read, I would wait for a sale like I did. I hardly spent any money, so I knew I wouldn't feel guilty if it didn't bring me a newfound appreciation for reading. In the end, it worked out beautifully for me and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase."
Bonsterblack,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace one I got a long time ago - one of those original models. This does everything better and faster and I absolutely love it. I would recommend it to anyone. I had to use the help option to transfer my books from my old Kindle to this one, but everyone was very helpful and we finally got it to work."
Christopher Waid,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle and I absolutely love it. It's so much easier on my eyes than trying to read on the LED screen on my phone. It's a good size but not ridiculously huge, so I can hold it one hand pretty easy. The backlights are nice and even with no bright or dim spots. It's also super easy to adjust the brightness depending on where I'm reading."
Alan Wood,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a bit smaller than I expected, but the light covers the whole screen, so I can read more easily than I could on my ten year old Kindle with the light on the case. I haven't tested the water resistance, and probably won't, but it has a higher rating than do my sports headphones. I do wish there was an ad free option."
Andi,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's not terrible. But it's not great. They claim it has an updated and faster processor, but I'm not seeing it. Typing has a lag of 1-3 seconds PER LETTER which makes typing anything a pain so note-taking is not really an option. Navigating the store is a headache because the page refresh rate is so slow. The e-ink screen in general is terrible at refreshing and takes a bit of getting used to. The touch screen is also not all that responsive.

The backlight is nice but it gives the display an unnatural blue light and feels like reading from a tablet or phone screen and strains the eyes. I find myself turning it off entirely as the screen looks much nicer that way.

The screen without the back light is incredible. It's so crisp and looks just like a paper book. It is so satisfying to read.

The battery life is 10/10. I haven't charged mine in 3 weeks and it's still at 50% battery with about 15 hours of reading done. That is the one redeeming quality.

The Kindle unlimited store is okay with quite a few pretty good B-list books to read but nothing truly amazing. It's also a headache to navigate on the thing so I find myself accessing it with my phone to figure out books I'd like to read and then searching that on the kindle.

Overall, its okay. But it's way too expensive at $130 and is not worth that price point. A cheap generic e-reader would probably do the same. I wouldn't buy another but this one isn't the end of the world."
JanoSanFran,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ideal for reading in bed. I pasted a pop-up on a book-end, and another on the back of my Kindle Paperwhite, and it holds beautifully for side-sleepers like me. I love the choices of text, and many other options. However, I've called Amazon a couple of times about the very bright light that flashes in my face for up to 4 seconds when it's turned on, and every time I turn a page, unless my finger is very lightly touching the kindle. Answer: nothing they can do. But apart from that annoyance, I love my Kindle Paperwhite."
P. Munson-siter,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle. While I love books, I also like being able to take along a Kindle to read while on trips, at appointments, and so on - when it is not convienent to carry around a whole bunch of books! This one also is capable of blue tooth connectivity for audio books, although I haven't used that feature yet. It is also nice that I don't have to worry about accidentally getting this model wet. For me it is well worth the price. I've had other eReaders in the past and the Kindle is by far the easiest to use."
J. McGrane,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this paper white to replace my 6 year old 2nd generation paper white. This new one is lighter and slightly smaller, a little brighter and crisper, with a different set up on the home page. But one of the most noteabke differences is the screen. The frame is incorporated into the kindle screen so it’s completely flat. It’s also very prone to fingerprints and smudging. It’s not noticeable in the dark obviously, but it really bothers me in the light. I had to buy a screen protector to help minimize this issue. The other thing I don’t like about it is that it takes a much longer time to wake up when I open the cover. My old kindle woke up right away- this one takes so long it actually lets me know it is “waking up”. All in all it’s not really an improvement."
Glenn A. Russell,5.0 out of 5 stars,I also like having many of my books on a lightweight device that I can carry with me. I like being able to read where I am without carrying several books. I can also keep my place in each book I am reading without bookmarks which can be lost or removed. Having my book content stored in a central server with access from different devices on a network makes a it portable library available almost anywhere.
El Gato,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't understand why this was $100. The interface is clunky and reading on it is uncomfortable. I don't care for it honestly. It was smaller then I thought it would be, which is my fault for not noticing but its a bit larger then my smart phone. 🤔 I bought it so I could read outside, its water resistance and battery time. But none of that matters if i don't like reading on it. Switching pages are cumbersome and buy time I enlarge words to my needed size, I'm turning pages every other second. I wouldn't buy again."
C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's my first kindle and I'm loving it. I'm reading way more than before and find it very comfortable. The kindle works best when using it under the sunlight. In medium-light spaces, you can still perceive it as a digital screen, but under the sun it's even better than an actual book. It's extremely light and can grab it with only one hand and read without trouble.
I'm a graduate student and most of the books I should read are not available at Unlimited, so wouldn't recommend it for people in academia who want to use it for work."
Medarisa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Kindle on sale especially for its longer battery life. It is all good, and I think Kindles are wonderful. For my first Kindle (The First Kindle), I couldn't get a battery to replace the original. The other three continue to work just fine, each one coming with a bit of improvement. I've read hundreds of books on them. I can bring any one of those back at any time, but I don't miss the shelves I'd have needed to store them physically. The only drawback is generally not being able to share them with friends without also sharing one of my Kindles!"
phodges0921,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I have been reading from my phone and computer for a number of years and really didn't see the benefit of having one more electronic device. After all, I could read whatever I wanted with what I already had. None the less, when I saw these on sale a while back I decided I would give it a try. Now, I use it to read almost exclusively. I particularly like the battery life and lightness of the Kindle Paperwhite. It feels more like I am holding a book. I should have done it years ago."
Rick N.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using Kindles since Gen 1 and it is now pretty much the only way I read books. No experience is better overall. If you are debating buying your first Kindle, don't dawdle. Buy this one, you will not regret it. This comment is directed mostly to Amazon which made the claim of extended battery life in the new model. Not so; it is the same as my prior model (maybe 1 or 2 generations back, origin 2016). It lasts pretty much my entire extended (3 day) weekend of reading, but then needs to be charged. I do keep it connected to wi-fi so I can use the lookup feature but I kept 2016 on wi-fi the same way. Anyway, I don't use it in the bath or the pool but do appreciate the smooth front and all the other standard features. That said, I did upgrade for extended battery life, so that is something of a disappointment."
ginnyjo armor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i love that i don't have to carry a light i can read anywhere anytime, light wieght and with the cover i got for it opens and sits in your hand like a small featherlight book really love this one and i got the 32 gb so i can have a ton of books with me all the time,also got yhe screensaver sheets just to keep the face cleaner and prevent scratch,very much like that i just get my books but can untilize my kindle unlimited and order anytime without all the other internet stuff they wastes my space for my books,hurray!!!"
Refurb,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got the Paperwhite as a gift and I've really enjoyed it. As a stand-alone reader it's outstanding! Battery life and backlit screen is also outstanding. Had a few conectivity issues (couldn't get it to pair in my car. I just use the app on my phone). The ""browser"" isn't very good either. My biggest complaint is they put the power button on the bottom and I often accidently bump it off while holing it one handed. It would have made more sense to put the button on the top because few people would hold it from the top. Overall - love it and still hightly recommend it."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had spent a lot of time deliberating as to whether to get an E reader or not. Ultimately decided to go with the Kindle paperwhite and I’m happy I did.

I bought the Kindle paperwhite along with the fabric cover that Amazon sells separately. Definitely worth buying the fabric cover. So far it has been durable and it makes the Kindle feel like more of a complete package. There is a magnetic closure on the cover which covers the screen when you’re not using the Kindle. When you decide to use the Kindle, smply open the cover like you would a book and wrap the front cover around to the backside and the magnet will hold the front cover in place. The Kindle turns on automatically when you open the cover, and turns off automatically when you shut the cover. Nice!

As for the paperwhite itself, I was a bit hesitant to purchase it as I had read several reviews indicating that the on off button on the bottom of the Kindle can be very touchy and cause you to inadvertently turn the Kindle off. This is not an issue at all with my Kindle. I can lay in bed and rest the bottom of the Kindle on me, and I will experience no accidental depress of the button. I tested it further by dropping the Kindle several inches onto the bottom of the Kindle, where the on/off switch is at, to see if it would inadvertently turn on and off. Again, no issues.

The paperwhite is easy on the eyes and has a very nice display. The only complaint that I would have is that I would like the screen to be a little brighter for my eyes. Don’t get me wrong, screen brightness is adequate. I would just like to see it a little brighter. I don’t read excessively for extreme long periods. I might pick it up and read for maybe a half an hour to an hour in the evening. That being the case, the Kindle battery life seems to last for weeks. Obviously, if you decide to purchase, you’ll be tied to Amazon’s ecosystem. But, Amazon’s ecosystem is very good. Lots of options for books. If your library is affiliated with overdrive, then you will have options to borrow books from your local library. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and do not regret it. I would have given this for five stars, but because I would like to see the display brightness just a little bit brighter than what it is (yes, it is adequate, just would like it a little brighter) So I rated it 4 stars"
Paul Kochanowski,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My previous Kindle reader stop functioning after about a decade or more. Also, it could only be used in well lit places. This new Kindle can be used anywhere regardless of the level of light, makes it easy to look up words, tells you how much time it will take to finish a particular section, and has a very long battery life. I also found it very easy after connecting it to my internet to download all of my previous reading material. Although with the case for it, it cost about $160 (which I thought a bit pricey), still it was well worth the money."
Eszter H.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I completely missed the part about the home screen coming with ads. If I had realized I was paying a little bit less for that, I never would have picked that option. This way, the screen is never just off, it has ads on it. Pretty much none of these ads are relevant for me and I find them annoying. As for the mechanics of the device, the touch screen works okay, but not great. There are all sorts of actions I have to do multiple times for the machine to register them. Overall, I am happy with the device, it's my first Kindle, but the ads are a big nuisance."
Dorf,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice kindle BUT this was my 6th Kindle and all of my collections simply did not transfer. And it took me repeated calls to ascertain that was the situation. I guess that I created the collections once so I can do it again. Doesn't make me happy, though.
Otherwise I LOVE the concept of a Kindle. I am a voracious reader and have been since childhood. I love having all my books at hand. I love rereading old favorites as well as new. I have AMD, so being able to adjust the print to bigger and darker is great."
BeyerofStuf,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked the device, but an item made today should not arrive broken. I've never seen any electronic device not take a charge out of the box. I suspect the quality control of the entire line now. I'll try to get another one, but I likely won't update the review. I expected to need this for a trip. The trip got postponed for unrelated reasons, but had I gone I would have not had a Kindle for 5 weeks nor any way to swap it out. Just because I got lucky doesn't mean that the device deserves more than one star for severe quality issues."
Emily H,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love my new Kindle Paperwhite. My only complaint, and this is if I am being EXTREMELY picky, is the location of the power button. The size of my hand and the way I hold the paperwhite while I’m reading, I have occasionally bumped the power button (as it is on the bottom of the device). I feel it would’ve been better on the top, although that’s just preference. The battery life is amazing, it is very user friendly, and the built in light up screen is so nice for nighttime reading in bed. Overall I love this device and highly recommend!"
Glenda C. Daugherty,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this item in good faith. Unfortunately I had to return it because the light wasn't working right out of the box. I called and they told me I would receive a new device in exchange for the one I had received.

That isnt what happened. I received a refurbished one instead of a new one."
Tara Danahy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first Kindle I’ve bought for myself after using the Kindle App on my iPhone for several months.

I have grown accustomed to it, and now really like it, but there was definitely an adjustment period.

At first, I was disappointed to find there was no color for the book titles and such...everything is in black and white. And I LOVE color. I also missed, and still do, the ease with which one could move about the app but cannot on the Paperwhite. In the app, you can highlight in different colors, and look backwards or forwards while holding your place, to name just a few is its perks. The Kindle itself is just not as intuitive or user-friendly as the app is. (This is the only reason I don’t give the product 5 stars.)

Having said that, as I use it every night for my reading, I have grown to love it...it is light and easy to hold and easy on the eyes. It is also a treat to travel with as its slim design takes up virtually zero space.

The battery lasts forever! I charge it once a week or so and with nightly use, still have never seen a charge-level of below 70%.

I wish I knew more about all the different models so I could determine which one is most like the app, but I am still very happy with my reader."
J Lamora,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have been using the 2018 Kindle for 2 weeks. Enjoying it so far, but doesn't seem much different than my 2013 Kindle. It is thinner, lighter, bezels are flat....being waterproof is not a concern for me. Purchased the leather cover by Amazon and feel the quality isn't as good as the previous cover. Probably wouldn't have upgraded, but seemed to be charging my old Kindle more often and got the new one on sale. Prefer reading on a Kindle over an iPad, etc."
CriticalButFair,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because I sometimes run into issues with the glare on my kindle (beach, kids athletic practices etc). The size is good and I expect that it will work out fine, but I have to say the lag time on the device is TERRIBLE. Moving from screen to screen I can't really tell if I didn't do something right or if it's loading. This is really only an issue when navigating the home screens etc. As far as when you're reading it works fine but still has a bit of lag, which I was surprised about since this is like the 10th generation and I would expect this not to be an issue with more modern processors."
CynDee,4.0 out of 5 stars,I cant seem to get to the chapter thing that used to be on the bottom of the pages of the other kindle to show up or on one book you could barely see it but you couldnt click the dots to jump to that chapter.. And I also cant seem to get to the beginning of the books or go to my kindles library/list when a book is being read. I have to double tap the screen to bring up recommnded books then hit the store then hit home then hit library to switch books. So I give four stars til eith I figure out whats going wrong or its fixed.
T. Walker,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to upgrade my Kindle 4th generation and finally did it. I like the light in the 10th generation, battery life is good when you don't connect to WIFI all the time an overall great book. I didn't like that my collections did not move over to my new Kindle, that's why the 4 stars. I followed the online instructions several times, and even called to no avail. I had to move books manually one book at a time into collections. Worse part was I had a collection of books on my old Kindle that were in a ""series"" collection to show which ones I had read and keep track of the new ones. It did not move and was not something shown in my Amazon library so it was lost completely. I will say at the time I got my 1st Kindle there was not the option to create collections on Amazon, however none of it ever synced between my old Kindle and my Amazon account so all was lost. :("
Cameron J. Fleury,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The fact it is water resistant is great, but not something you notice (unless, of course, you drop it in the pool, etc.) but it is comforting to know it is not likely to need to be replaced if it gets wet. I am still getting used to the new menu and library. The size is not noticeably different my previous Kindle, but it did require a new cover. I have also started storing my e-books to the cloud, so the additional space is not going to be noticed by me. So, in short there are no earth-shattering changes. But, why mess with something that works?"
Felicia Thorn,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I previously had a Kindle Fire 7 which I loved however the screen broke. So I took the opportunity to upgrade and heard great things about the PaperWhite. Honestly, it takes some getting used to after using a tablet/phone device for so long. It doesn’t do the page curl like the Kindle app offers which is weird to me but that’s what takes some getting used to for me. It seems delayed to touch but I’m not sure if it’s just like that it if it’s a calibration thing. I also miss the color of the covers. The device itself is fine. Battery doesn’t seem like it lasts as long as it states that it does. Also note that it only comes with a cord, no wall plug."
J Dude,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I like the e-reader but have a few concerns about it. The touch screen for the most part works well but does have a bit of a delayed reaction at times. Also after having the reader for only 2 weeks it suddenly started to reboot while I was in the middle of reading a book and then froze. I couldn't get to wake up. Finally found what to do but couldn't believe I had to hold the on/off button for 40 seconds. Got it working again and all seems fine so hopefully this doesn't happen often. Otherwise it's easy to use, was easy to set up, and battery life is decent."
PhotoGene47,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The super lightweight of the tablet [compared to a more generalized tablet that I have] makes it easy to hold in your hand to read material. The font can be changed for both type and size. I did have to make the screen brighter to be able to read the print easily. There are a couple items that could use improvement. The first is that it is a tad bit sluggish when changing pages or using its built-in web browser ability. The second thing is that it is black and white which is great for novels but not as great for reading technical books. Still, I like it and will probably use it mostly for reading novels."
Julie P,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’d like to start out with it’s not that I don’t like the kindle, because I do. My dissatisfaction comes from the fact that Amazon does not include the charging adaptor with the kindle. My kindle arrived half charged and only the charging cord not an adapter. Why should you have to pay extra for an adapter to charge your device? Apple at least includes all the equipment you need to charge your device. Disappointed in Amazon for that. That’s why I gave only a three star review."
Hannah,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Even after reading previous reviews stating the glare was definitely noticable on the newest kindle I thought I could still learn to live with it. I love my 3rd generation kindle paper white. There is nothing really wrong with it I was just ready for an upgrade, but I will stick with what I have for now.

The new features of waterproof & whispersync, while nice are not ones I find necessary. I do not read near water very often & I never use the whisper sync while reading. I do enjoy listening to audio books, but just use the audible app on my phone so this feature is useless to me.

As for the glare free screen that I LOVE on my older kindle this one is horrible. At first I believed I could live with it, but quickly realized how wrong that was while laying on my couch in front of a soft light lamp. I couldn't see the screen due to the glare & eventually had to move to a lower light area. On top of this the newer screen shows every little fingerprint further compromising the readability. I sincerely hope they bring back the original screen especially for those of us who don't find the usefulness of a waterproof kindle.

I realize this kindle also has greater storage, but I currently have 1000+ books in my kindle library & have never had a problem maxing out my older kindle."
Vlad Bril,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The device is great, easy to use and pretty much intuitive except for a few user interface issues that are not well explained even in the user manual. Specifically I had problems figuring out how exactly to use my finger to get a pull-down menu to show up or how to highlight some text or get a note to show up. I even did not know for a long time that there was a User's Guide on my Kindle because I had no idea how to see my full library. You have to make the initial starter education easier and more intuitive. Even the explanations for the user's interface when it comes to using one's finger are not very clear, in my opinion."
D Redding,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle. This is my second one. The first one was starting to act up at times so when Amazon Prime Day came along I decided to get a new one. I do like the smooth surface but at times I have turned a page accidentally. Really, except for the waterproof I don’t see any real difference from the old one. Now, of course, my old one is behaving perfectly, but I’ll just keep it for a backup. I doubt that I will ever need the waterproof feature, but since I use it in the kitchen to read while I’m cooking it does give me peace of mind for splashes."
Didar,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle which I bought as a gift for my fiance. She is loving it. However, the touch-screen response is painfully slow. Also, the refresh-rate when you go to a new page. But I guess that's true for all other versions as well.

My recommendation for first-time buyers is that the screen size is actually smaller than you see on the pictures.

This can be connected with blue-tooth headphones to listen to audio-book which I thought was cool.

The battery life stays for several weeks when not used (hibernation)."
Stacy marie,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got this for my brother for Christmas and he absolutely loves it !! I was really happy to since I got it for a great deal on cyber Monday .. he loves to read and this is a easy way to read all your favorite books and it saves you money since you can buy the digital version versus having to buy a hard cover book ! The battery life is extremely long .. my brother even said he can go a couple days without having to charge it ! It has a built in light which is great for reading in a dark room . Very happy with this purchase
D. E. Shutt,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have never owned a Kindle before you will love this Paperwhite. If you have the last gen, you will know that the Paperwhite has jumped the shark.

I was immensely pleased to have a blue Kindle in my life. Then I attempted to use it. It is slow to wake, slow enough in fact that they had to add another message ""waking up"" to the process. Still though it was blue, and the waking was only annoying when you opened it up. Even though it was odd that the old one was measurably faster, no matter the old wasn't blue.

So I placed in my vertical stand and it started going crazy. Almost as though the power button was being depressed randomly. Yes, that was it, the power button is positioned in such a way that you cannot use it caseless in a vertical stand. Sadly, this is how I use my current Paperwhite 90% of the time. But it was still blue.

So if you use a case, it will just be slower than the old one, and as I stated above, if you have never had a Kindle before
you will have no comparison and you will love it for all of the standard Kindle things it does perfectly well. Otherwise, stick to the 7th gen or a Voyage. I could have made this work, but why bother when I already own a better product?

As for me, in wandering around Amazon I see I can get a Voyage for 79.99 with Prime. Blue or no, it has to go. Profoundly sorry/not sorry for that last line."
Susanson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this Kindle but specifically ordered this with 4G in addition to WiFi and paid the price for it. Box says it has 4G but Kindle doesn't actually have it.
Am contacting customer service about this right now... as this version has been discontinued and the now available PaperWhite with 4G is $70 more. NOT HAPPY."
Urbanus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an e-paper device, this reader performed well. The interface is touch friendly and the backlight is very evenly distributed to provide a comfortable experience even with the lights off. Although it is water resistant I did not test this feature.

I recommend the designers relocate the power button away from the bottom of the reader. This will prevent accidentally putting the device to sleep mode when propping the book up on a hard surface. The weight is comfortable enough to hold the reader on one hand with 3 fingers.

Add speakers so that it is not necessary to use a headset for audio."
Lynda Wadler,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Voyage and I loved it! But, it stopped charging. Seems to be the place you plug in the charger. They don’t make it anymore, so I got the Paperwhite. I’m not happy with it. The Voyage held the charge for 4-6 weeks. I have to charge the Paperwhite about 1X/week. The on/off switch is on the bottom where I hold the device and I keep hitting the switch and it turns off. This keeps happening while I’m trying to read. Using my book list is very unfriendly. I go to the list and books that have expired from the library and book samples come up, but it’s challenging to get to the regular list. I download new books and can’t get back to the book I was reading. It takes a few minutes of trying different things. When you go to library, one page comes up with about 3 or 4 books, the new one and usually expired ones and the only way I can get to another page is to open a box, type in 2 or 3, etc and maybe get that page. But, the place to tap to go to the box is too close to a book and instead of going to the box, it opens a book. It’s very frustrating. I wish I could get a new Voyage!!!. Why would Amazon get rid of such a perfect item!!!"
H. Keshishyan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the first generation kindle e reader and it was great. Came with free cell WiFi and it was just simple. I gave that away a few years ago and regret it. This new kindle isn’t bad but just not as good as the first and you would think they would’ve just improved it. The touch screen is too sensitive. I like to use my fingers to help my eyes follow the sentences and this kindle keeps on changing the page. It’s annoying. Turning off touch screen doesn’t help. It still changes the page. Maybe I have to get used to it but so far I don’t enjoy reading it. The first generation had a larger screen as well although it was bulky compared to this. Oh well, as the saying goes. They don’t make them like hey use to."
Daisy Minton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I noticed that my 4 years old likes to read and she uses the kindle app on her iPad or my kindle, I didn’t want her to hurt her eyes, so I decided to buy a kindle for her. And she loves it! We use it almost every day, This one is waterproof which is perfect for a kid! Kindle is definitely the best device for reading!"
J. Caneday,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using Kindles since the Kindle Keyboard came out almost ten years ago. I went from that, to an early Paperwhite. I've found the new Paperwhite a big improvement. The slimmer, lighter design is nice. But the two features I notice and love the most are the improved screen resolution and improved responsiveness highlighting text.

The battery life is good, but I've still only charged it when I got it a few weeks ago, with only moderate use since then. So I don't have a good sense of the battery life yet."
Greg K,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Where do I start. Same user experience as with my first kindle white - but that was years ago. Same flickering screen, clicking and waiting for an action, twice the price, and - worst of all - getting the “incompatible with your kindle” trying to download a book message. Seriously? I’m not going to buy my books again just because got a new kindle. Big fan of Bezos but I bet he doesn’t use this device - but he should. When you copy kindle on iPad experience but without a glare - let me know and I am getting it. For now - going to iPad again"
Guo Ziyi,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, it's an OK device that I'm happy with, BUT:
- The most frustration comes from that power button below. Honestly, I can't understand who made such an idiotic design decision to put the power button at the bottom and PROTRUDING. I don't think there is any easy way to avoid accidentally touching it, and it's annoying to me.
- The software is said to be mainly written in Java, which is slow and not very responsive.

Being washable is a big plua though."
seventhseal,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me say that if you need a boost to get back into reading, there is no better way. Already reading 5 books in parallel with the new Kindle and it is an awesome travel piece! Now to the Paperwhite 10th Gen. I have a Kindle Keyboard that I still use and love but the backlit display on the Paperwhite 10th Gen is great! Easy on the eyes, no blue light and can read in the dark without distracting others. Touch is responsive, display great even - though slightly updated in 10th Grade with better pixel density. Good weight...battery life doesn't seem as good as it used to but it now has a backlight so I expect some degredation. All in all, 5 stars so far. Great job Amazon.."
Thad,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I misplaced my 3rd Gen Kindle paperwhite, and decided to get the new edition as a replacement. After about 2 weeks (4 books later), I don’t get the 1-star reviews at all! The button location on the bottom has never bothered me, and I have never had it turn off by itself. You have to press the button until it clicks for the device to turn off. The boot up time is exactly like my previous Kindle (almost immediate), unless you CHOOSE to turn off the display, and fully put the device to sleep. This does conserve some battery between uses. The battery life is robust, and the device almost feels weightless. The display is crisp and although seems shiny when it is off (you will see some reflection), it is not noticeable in the direct sun when the screen is backlit.
I haven’t had to test the water resistant aspect of the device, but that is a definite plus for poolside reading.
Great product, I feel as though some negative reviews on here are due to user error!"
Doobie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only had it for two weeks, but I'm in love with it. I had the first generation of Kindle with keyboard and the difference is amazing. The screen is so easy to read and just taping to change page is wonderful. It's taken me a while to get use to the different ways to do things, but I'll get there. There was a small glitch where the screen froze for a minute, but it started again. I read a lot, so the battery needs to be recharged more often than I like. All in all, I'm delighted with Paperwhite. I still have my old one. Want to trade?"
Ryane,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love love love this kindle! The size, weight and everything else. I was afraid of some reviews but I really wanted a kindle just for books so I switched from a kindle fire and it was worth it. I don’t like all the extra stuff like apps and games when I’m reading like on the fire. It synced to my account with ease and even kept all my highlights from previous books I’ve read. I am not having any issue with the button on the bottom as others mentioned, it’s not so easy to press so I haven’t gotten interrupted by accidentally pressing it. I can put it on my lap and hold it from the bottom and it doesn’t get affected. I recommend this 100 percent for e books"
Myra Flagg,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As an e-reader it is OK--light weight, small and compact. The paperwhite has no color on the screen. Everything is grey scale, which means reading the titles of the books is sometimes difficult. Also, the homepage has advertising in the form of ""other suggestions"" for books to read. It is annoying to navigate past that. When I want to look at my list of books, I have to always press ""all"" to get the complete list--why can't that be the default? Even scrolling through my library is slow. Reading a given book is fine and pages advance quickly and easily. The homepage should be set up differently to feature the books in your library. This is the third kindle I have owned but I actually prefer the kindle fire which I only used for reading (not as a tablet), because the layout was better. The paperwhite is light weight and easier to take along, but otherwise not as pleasing."
Lwhitehead,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased my first Kindle Paperwhite in 2013 (2nd gen, I believe), and have been enjoying it immensely for the past 6 years. It paid for itself within the first week! I have carried mine thousands of miles, all over the US, and more recently to the West coast of Mexico, and it has served me well My dear friend (who has become more of a bookworm of late), decided to order one as well. I felt that I was long overdue for an upgrade after sitting out on the Voyage and Oasis. I love the new Paperwhite as much as I loved my first one! The e-ink is noticeably sharper, and I’m pleased to see that the screen sits flush with the edge of the tablet. It still feels so familiar, and I love that I’ve been able to pick up where I left off. I was in my final semester of undergrad studies when I purchased my first one, and as an English Major, I had very little time to read anything other than the required reading for class. My Paperwhite helped me find the joy again, and made a large portion of my personal library accessible no matter where I happened to be. I was a late convert to the e-reader scene, but I can safely say, that you can have both. Having a Kindle in no way changes my love for a book; whether it’s the feel, the heft of one, the smell of an old one (or a new one, distinctly different), or the sensation of turning the pages. If you’re on the fence about purchasing an e-reader, I highly recommend the Paperwhite as a go-to, everyday device. I read on mine daily, and every night when I’m in bed. The backlight makes reading before falling asleep so easy; I also find that I read more throughout the day, as I can find a few minutes to pick up the Kindle and finish a chapter."
Luke,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent battery life. OTOH, blue light (the backlight is closer to green/blue than the yellowish showing on the page) is not conducive for comfortable night readings. The backlight needs to be fixed for a more warmer color. Coming from phones/tablets, the reader painfully slow to navigate. I wouldn't recommend it for reading non-fictions, where cross-reference, search are more frequent.

In any case, don't use it in the evening, as your sleep quality will plummet due to the blue light content in the backlight suppressing the natural melatonin cycle."
Josh Maus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received this new Kindle Paperwhite, and while it has only slight improvements over the previous generation, these improvements are most welcome. First, the new version finally has a completely flat front screen and bezels (like a tablet or smartphone). This new screen also feels much harder and more durable, whereas the old screen felt as if you could tear through it with your fingernail. It is slightly lighter (0.7 oz lighter by my measurement), as advertised, and the waterproofing, larger storage options, and Bluetooth are also welcome upgrades."
Tmax Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was reading books on my iPad or Fire and was experiencing eye strain after a long reading session. The Kindle eliminates that problem. I read a lot about people complaining about the ads when the unit is not being used. Not sure why people are so incensed about it. The ads are on the screen when you are not using the Kindle! Why do you care?
This kindle has made a very positive difference in my ability to read books for a long period of time. I would buy it again and recommend it without reservation."
C. CASH,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle Paperwhite, but am having some trouble downloading all of my library. Some books, when tapped, show Queued, but they are not in my Downloaded files, and they do not show the black dot with the check mark inside. After doing some research online, I discovered that different internet connections may work differently with the Kindle Paperwhite. I do not have internet at home, but we have full wi-fi access where I work, so I tried to download all my books, while at work, and several of them will not download. Therefore I cannot read them at home offline. I originally started out with a Kindle Fire, and had no problem getting all of my library downloaded.
I do enjoy the size and how light weight it is. Very convenient to take with me anywhere."
Dennis,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought the new Kindle Paperwhite mainly because I wanted the screen's backlight. I needed a lot of room light to read my older Kindle. I love that I can read the Paperwhite in lower light. I find it much easier to read. I also really like the longer battery life. I'm retired and read a lot of books (love Kindle Unlimited) so it's really nice having more time between charges. Overall I just love my Paperwhite!
NCuster,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted a device to read books that could get wet as I camp and go boating. This does exactly what I want. The special offers are not a big deal, when the device wakes up you see an offer until you swipe and there are offers at the bottom of the screen. Once you are in the book though all you see is the book until you are done reading.
I had a cook book on the device and it got wet while I was cooking but I was just able to wipe it dry with no issues at all. Downloads are easy and getting books for free through my public library (overdrive) is no problem at all. I normally do all of the checkout on my phone and then the book shows up on the kindle when I start it up.
My only complaint, which isn't even worth decreasing the rating, is that sometimes it seems a bit slow to respond when I open a book. Otherwise great little device."
M. Dencause,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my new Kindle. This replaces a 2014 model with 167 PPI. I will say the clarity is wonderful. The speed of starting the unit is also great. The speed of charging time, wow that is a great improvement.
I did get the model with 'no adds.' Some friends have gotten the model with adds, and then they always have to pay to remove them. Way to annoying.
This model is water resistant, this is nice feature and also one I hope never to have to check.
All in all at great purchase. Highly recommend."
JKillough,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth Kindle, and what these little devices do is amazing. The ability to carry your entire library with you wherever you, search for keywords in any book, access definitions with a touch of a finger, highlight passages and take notes, and all the other helpful things Kindles can do have completely won me over. However, this latest Kindle, (10th Generation-2018), has caused me to drop from 5 stars to 3 stars. But only for one reason: the page turning feature. All page turning on this model is done on the touch screen, there are no buttons. As with previous models, you can turn pages backwards and forward by swiping in either directions. You can turn also turn pages by simply touching the screen. To turn forward, you touch the right four-fifths of the screen. To turn back, you touch the left one-fifth of the screen. The problem is that if you hold the Kindle in your left hand you can't use your thumb to just reach up and turn the page forward because you can't reach far enough over on the screen to touch the turn forward portion on the right four-fifths of the screen. I miss the page turning buttons on my previous model that allowed me to turn back or forward while comfortably holding my Kindle with one hand."
Linda S Rice,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Kindle given to me 5 years ago but never liked it. The touch screen was fussy, the glare was terrible, and I quit using it. Now, with the new paperwhite, the screen is perfectly lit, responsive to touch, goes back to the home screen quickly when I want it to, I can read it in virtually any light. And because I like to read in the pool, I like that it's waterproof. It's lightweight, compact, doesn't take up a lot of space but the font size I have set perfectly so it's very easy to read. I haven't learned all the features yet, but so far, I love it!"
SJD,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My 5 year old Kindle works much better than this version. This Kindle will change pages, back or forward, without me touching the screen. Also I HATE seeing the promotion that I must endure while this one 'wakes up' and the time required for going to the last page I was reading appears to take much longer than the older model. I gave my perfectly good Kindle to my husband and am giving serious consideration to taking it back. My husband has never used a Kindle so hopefully he will not find these new features annoying."
Baturalp,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I regret upgrading to latest generation of Kindle Paperwhite. It’s noticeably slower than the previous generation. It takes 2-3 seconds to wake up the device. It was instant in the previous generation. They slightly changed the form factor so your case will not fit. The only positive thing is waterproof design.

Unless you absolutely need a waterproof e-reader, do not upgrade your Kindle to the latest generation."
TJReads,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my old paperwhite for this new version and couldn't be happier. Not that I really need the waterproof, I don't read near water, but I certainly love the bluetooth using voice view and having it backlight. I first bought the 8th gen kindle with bluetooth but no backlighting, unable to read or see commands without lights on. I also have the Oasis which I use every day, I love the bigger screen but for listening pleasure while doing housework or taking a walk, this new Kindle 10th gen is my go-to kindle. I have an ear bud bluetooth which works perfectly, once you get the double touch commands down, the pleasant worman voice is easy on the ear. Highly recommend."
Michele,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not sure if I have a lemon or if the new model has issues. The screen seems to jump back a page or so for no reason. I will be simply holding it and put a bit of a pressure change on it as I adjust my grip and the page changes. Also, if I have the unit turned on and disconnect from charging, it will freeze. It has to be turned off and the back on to unfreeze the device. Lastly, the battery life does not appear to be as long between charges. I have contacted support and told to perform a factory reset. I did and have not had an opportunity to determine e if that resolved the issue yet."
Cheryl in Texas,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I want to love my new Kindle Paperwhite. It is definitely a great, portable way to always have my books with me. But at least once a week I have to reboot my Kindle before I can continue reading my book. And sometimes the battery has plenty of charge when I finish reading, but then it drains to 0 and it shuts down completely. This happened numerous times before I started using the power button to put it to ""sleep"" just in case the cover wasn't doing it. But it still keeps happening. Sunday night it went from 80% charged to 0 and wouldn't turn on when I tried to use it again Monday. VERY FRUSTRATING."
Amy K,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was pretty excited about this, but it doesnt quite live up to my expectations. The screen is a bit glitchy and periodically freezes. The layout of the controls is not very intuitive and requires entering different menus for text size and screen brightness. My biggest issue is the fact that it will restart when even gently set on end like you might if you were using a kickstand/tablet holder. My previous kindle didn’t have this issue. I really like the backlight and I enjoy reading with the screen reversed (black background with light letters) so I’ll continue to use it, but I hope they fix those things in future versions."
Kate M. Stewart,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought this in early Feb. after my tried and true original FINALLY died after a good 2+ years of heavy use. It has given up the ghost in 5 months😟
Honestly Im shocked. Not to mention sad.
UPDATE: I spoke to a customer service guy who told me what buttons to push and other stuff, and lo and behold he FIXED AND REBOOTED IT!! Has been fine for the past 6 months and still steady on."
Jacob D Goden,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The product is fine. The screen isn’t grainy, you can search and buy books easily, and the battery life lasts as long as advertised. But I’m giving it two stars because of the whole “special offers” strategy. When you buy one a kindle, you have the option of getting it with or without ”special offers”. They’re just advertisements. Your lock screen? Yup, just a rotation of advertisement images. You'll also usually have some kind of banner ad on the bottom of your home screen. Don't worry, you can disable the ads, but only if you pay $20 in addition to the price of the device. I understand advertising on otherwise free products and software, but seriously, I paid over 100 dollars for this, the least you could do is not bombard me with ads for more of your products."
Victor Ximenes,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Touch screen is not reliable, occasionally for reason unknown jumps ahea a dozen pages, and to get back where you were is a pain in the neck. Buttons were crisp and failure proof.
Most important there is NO WAY to fast browse the library ! Revise the software 1 I have 32 pages of library, is I want to go to page 15, I must painfully turn each page Awfull. Very sorry I choose ""special options"" it is a scam I can do without.
I think that will trash my letter white and at grand expence have my kindle 3 repaired."
Jordan,3.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve had it for several days now. Intuitive getting it setup and reading. Surprised at how quickly the battery depletes though and feel like the option when purchasing was a bit intentionally misleading as far as “getting special offer” AKA you always have ads. Apparently you have to pay an extra $20 to not get “special offers”. Didn’t find this out until after purchased and couldn’t figure out how to turn them off. Look forward to getting more reading in though!
G,5.0 out of 5 stars,"**Update, the replacement (right) has arrived today, it’s way better!!!! The tone is brighter and uneven texture is unnoticeable. Compared to the original one (left), I feel the replacement (right) is actually “paper white” but the original (left) one is kind of a grey-ish tone and looks like there are dust or fog on the screen. I put them side to side and now I know for sure the original one is defected. Now I can enjoy my book.

**original review: The middle and lower page is darker than the upper page, it makes my eyes tired and the darker part is just annoying... they will send me a replacement and I’ll do a quick compare after I get it, I’ll update my review then.

I have a 6th generation paper white and that one has perfect screen, so I immediately noticed the issue when I start reading with the new one and I was thinking it’s not a big deal and gave it a try. But Noooooo......my eyes are tired after 20 minutes and I cannot help noticing the dark part.....so I go to customer service and apply the in warranty replacement."
Nat M. Zorach,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this mostly to read a bunch of PDFs and .EPUB books for school. Little did I know that these all have to be converted into Amazon's proprietary file format. This doesn't take a long time and you can find free ways to do it, but it's annoying. Worse is the fact that you can't transfer these things wirelessly, because Kindle only syncs with whatever is on Amazon's website in your own account-- so, while they have a Kindle application for desktop, it does *literally nothing*. Really frustrating and I wasted a lot of time trying to figure this out."
Jamie G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this as an upgrade to my very old kindle. It’s nice that it lights up but still is paperwhite. Doesn’t hurt your eyes or over stimulate so you ruin going to sleep. Light and much more user friendly than my last one. Excited for the waterproof-ness so I can take to pool and beach and not be nervous!
Jerry Weinstein,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Its hard to add anything to what the universe must know about Kindles at this point -- easy to use, easy to read in different lighting situations, super lightweight. In addition to recreational reading I use it at my volunteer job at the zoo as a resource to look up animals in the zoo inventory to get specific information about age, weight, diet, etc. of a specific animal. Its in a large spreadsheet that would be impossible to read on a conventional tablet in full sunlight while on the grounds and is too bulky to carry around in paper form."
Amazonian Customer Carolee,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Newest Kindle falls short on expectations.
“Wake up” start up is much slower- annoying!
Menu isn’t as easy to negotiate( Received this version for Christmas and can’t figure out how to load my previously purchased books from the Cloud) This will be my 4th Kindle. You’d think it would be faster and smarter even more user friendly - BUT NOT!!!!!
My older model of Kindle Light is better. Will be returning the new one."
Sara Reinert,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredibly disappointed. I've had a Kindle Paperwhite for years and it was starting to have some pixilation issues, so I decided to upgrade to the new edition. I've been having nothing but issues with the new Paperwhite. It doesn't hold a charge at all compared the old one, it smudges incredibly easily, and is glitchy/takes a long time to wake up. I hate that I mailed in my old one for trade. I've been stuck using my phone a lot for reading at the moment. I can't honestly recommend this new Paperwhite."
D. Sharpe,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this new Kindle, not because my old one died but because it had slowed down it's response time. This new one isn't any better and actually is a bit worse. I have to periodically do a hard reset because it locks up and I have never had to do that with my previous ones. There is noticeable lag in the response to a screen press/touch quite often. Often enough to be aggravating. The price keeps going up because of new ""features"" but I am not impressed. If I hadn't already turned over my old kindles to my kids, I would go back to them."
Sarah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband bought this for me for my birthday and I'm so glad I finally made the switch from Nook to Kindle. I love that it's water resistant so I don't have to worry about reading in the bath and it's small and light so it doesn't weigh down my purse. The special offers don't bother me at all, they are just a screen saver and go away when you wake up your Kindle. The battery life is outstanding, I typically only charge it once every couple of weeks and that's when I read it everyday and the backlight allows me to read whenever and wherever without having to strain my eyes in the dark. Overall I would definitely suggest this device :)"
John Cotton,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this thing. As someone who grew up with physical books it took me a long time to warm up to the idea of not having an actual book. Finally took the dive when it was on sale. Can't do without it now. I can have multiple books loaded on this thing, screen is nice, bright and crisp.

My only gripe is the position of the button, it's pretty easy to press it and cause it to go to sleep. You get use to it but every so often I still hit it. Still, love this thing and for the price it is awesome."
Sammi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it. I have been using a Kindle fire which is great but not in sunlight. I love my paperwhite.
Benefits: 1- VERY lightweight! Seriously, not even as heavy as my phone. 2- no glare. So readable in sunlight. 3- battery life, battery lasts 3-4 days reading several hours a day with wifi left on. 4-small enough to fit in my coat pocket. 5- best for last...WATERPROOF!
Cons: 1- does not easily switch from white background black letters to black background with white (inverted text in settings) but I am accustomed to reading with blue light removed @ night. For me it is an adjustment but not huge."
Educator,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3 Kindle device (and I gave the oldest one to my sister)!

I bought a new one for larger memory!! I currently have 417 books downloaded. If I had bought the actual hardback or paperback of these books... Can you imagine how much space 400 real books takes up? Kindle Paperwhite is an awesome way to always have your books with you. On vacation, waiting for appointments, the options are endless!

Paperwhite Kindle is awesome! I can read in complete dark without disturbing my husband. In addition the screen in full sun is not compromised by glare and I can read without problems.

I like the idea of waterproof as well, sitting by a pool I now no longer have to worry about water damage!

Amazon you have outdone yourself! Spectacular product!!!"
YB Hoel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is remarkably lightweight! The rubberized back allows for easy, secure handling. I am using mine in a case because I frequently toss it in a tote for commuting.
I like the smooth face. No crumb/dust collecting with this one.😊 The battery life and additional storage make it well worth the upgrade. However, for me, the waterproof feature is the best reason to buy this new Kindle Paperwhite.. Spending a lot of time outdoors and poolside during warmer weather makes this a must have feature."
Jeff,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first one, so far, its been relatively* easy to use *(small learning curve with the functions and linking to your kindle app). Touch screen is can be a little bit of pain as its not as responsive as a cell phone (difference in tech I know, but don't be surprised or annoyed with it).
Im a guy with pretty large hands, its easy to hold in bed and read. Letters are crisp and backlight doesn't blind your eyes.
Battery has been pretty sufficient for on and off use through the week.
Overall, great product for traveling or even having at home."
Marybeth Stilley,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing really wrong with it if you're not used to something else. It's functional. I thought I'd like it more than I do. I like the Fire better, though. It changes font size without my permission and I can't seem to stop it from shutting down every time I look away from it for more than 5 minutes though I've searched for a setting option to stop it. Also, the lack of color on the book covers is weird to me. It's too monochrome and takes away from the attractiveness of the cover and makes all of the books look alike. I wish I'd gone for another Fire."
B. Johnston,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My previous e-reader was a 7th gen paperwhite, and I loved it. I bought this one because the battery was fading on my earlier one, after three years of intensive use. This new one is even lighter and easier to hold, it's actually nicer than holding a mass market paperback, and I never thought I'd say that about an e-reader. Setup was a breeze, I just logged in with my amazon account and all my books showed up in a few minutes of synching. I haven't tried connecting it to bluetooth headphones yet and listening to my audiobooks, but am looking forward to trying it."
KaydeeDee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I took advantage of Prime Day deals and grabbed the new Paperwhite trading on my Paperwhite from years ago. Right now I'm really liking the upgrade, and enjoying my reading experience on it. First, I love the flat screen and seamless bezel. The unit performs well with smooth page turns. I love the lighter weight, and slimmer profile, making it easier to hold while reading. I was also using my Kindle touch in lieu of my older unit. But I find myself wanting to grab the new Paperwhite. I'm so glad to have had the opportunity to upgrade so easily."
Marcus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a bit hesitant to purchase this kindle after having been dissatisfied with my first kindle, the Kindle Keyboard, but Amazon has really outdone themselves with this newest version. The speed and screen clarity have been greatly improved and far surpassed my expectations. Reading in the dark is gentle on my eyes and doesn't cause severe eye strain as looking at a monitoring for a similar amount of time might. The Kindle Paperwhite is extremely light, and I can hold it in one hand for many hours without much effort, which is great for voracious readers that can't seem to put books down, like myself.

The one issue that I've noticed is that the screen and backing are magnets for fingerprints, and you find fingerprints EVERYWHERE after only using it for a day or so. Be prepared to clean it daily so the fingerprints don't interfere with the screen text.

I only wish that I had known how good the Paperwhite Kindle series was while I was in college, as this would have saved me a ton of money and stress of waiting for a book to come in the mail while professors assigned reading assignments within the first week of the quarter. If you're looking for a gift for a college-bound student, avid reader or even if you yourself want to get back into reading I would 100% recommend this item as it has reinvigorated my love of reading and it's discreteness provided by its small black design allows you to take it places where it might be otherwise inappropriate or inconvenient to have a large paperback book.

I have yet to test out the waterproof feature, as having any personal hand-held technology near water gives me instant anxiety. I'll have to test it once I overcome my innate instinct to protect my devices from water.

Tracking my battery life, with 10 hours of use I’ve used about 10% battery life, give or take a bit. Although it’s important to note I’ve stuck to reading exclusively (no audiobook), use little or no backlight during the day and turn airplane mode on when I’m not downloading books. Obviously, the battery usage will vary depending on usage, but I am satisfied with the current battery drain.

Overall, I give the Kindle Paperwhite a 5/5, other than the fingerprint issues and the capitalistic ethicality of selling a product at a discounted price that comes loaded with ads (I digress). I am very pleased with my purchase and will most likely be using this as a go-to gift for friends and family that are avid readers."
Dee,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know why people continue to fix things that are not broke. I swipe up to turn the page and download the book that I had just read and deleted. I have 3 kindles. I finish a little book on my fire. turn on my paperwhite and there it is, downloaded. I didn't want it downloaded on my paperwhite. I share my kindle with my sister, same thing, she downloads a book and there it is on my paperwhite.

When I say I want to see all books. It shows the kindle and audio. Since I often have both.....I just want to see the books not the audios. I have 3 ipods to listen to my books on. I don't need them to show up if I say books. My old fire (I hate the new one), audio is a whole different tab. I might love my old fire......best. It still has the carousel.

I often think I may have to get some of them unread paperbacks I have up from the basement.

Stop fixing things that are not broke!!!!"
Della Bassman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this kindle on sale, and used their pay by the week option so it was a steal. That being said if I hadn't gotten it on sale I don't know if it would have been worth it. I'm used to seeing my books in color on my kindle fire, and having other apps on my kindle in addition to books. This is only in black and white and only plays ebooks and audiobooks which is slightly disappointing. However it's not too pricy and I was looking for an ereader. I've had some small glitches occuring when I change screens or turn the kindle on or off, but these seem to resolve pretty quickly. Overall I'm satisfied with this product, but not enough to give it five stars"
Kindle Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am still really getting to know my kindle. But so far i am pretty disappointed in touch screen, and the way it lags a bit. I am also a bit upset about the fact that i can only swipe left or right to go through the books in my library, which causes me to accidently open whatever book is in the location i am swiping. I dont really like how i can't organize my books by purchased or borrow from kindle unlimited or prime reading.i love that i am able to read in bed at night without disturbing my partner. But i dont like how all of a sudden .y kindle stopped giving me the option to look at what page i am on and is only giving me the percentage of how far i am in the book."
Kindle Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to like this Kindle Paperwhite. I have the other paperwhite and wanted the extra space, water proof etc
It may just be me. but I have ordered this twice and now returning it again. I have 800 books and I properly loaded them a little at a time so they all indexed... keeping paperwhite plugged in. Excited as they all loaded! It remained plugged in over night.

The next day I read for about an hour. It was about 80 percent before I went to bed.

The next morning I opened it up and the battery was at 0.

I have friends who have this paperwhite and doing just fine, however my two have not kept the charge. .
I have other Kindle products as well as Nook, Kobo etc and never had these issues
I really wanted it to work, but for now I will stay with my other paperwhite that been awesome for 3 years and keeping a long battery life!"
caleb,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was disappointed when I found out that certain 'Kindle edition' ebooks and etextbooks are not compatible with the Kindle Paperwhite. I originally bought this product as a means to eliminate the need for extremely heavy and expensive textbooks and reading material in school. I even went as far as to search to make sure ebooks and etextbooks of my subject matter was offered. I should have read the fine print. It doesn't bode well to know the Kindle Paperwhite product is limited in retrospect to any other kindle products, and for relatively the same price; In the end your paying for the aesthetic of the, no glare, paper-like read, with Bluetooth audible and no tablet-like or Kindle app features whatsoever. oh its waterproof -_- Please try and understand what you could be potentially buying here."
Jenna Hayes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good on the replacement for our original 1G Paperwhites. However, I see little to no difference in the old and new. I expected the experience to speed up but it didn’t. The clarity of the words and pictures is deeper but not enough to make a difference. I purchased these using the upgrade benefits on Prime Day, for the large storage in hopes of listening to more audiobooks and Bluetooth in that regard. In the end, I wouldn’t waste much money on this upgrade. However, if this is your only Paperwhite purchase, go for it!"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this device because reading on my cell phone, while convenient, was causing vision problems. The larger screen is a little better on my eyes. It felt a little awkward the first couple days holding the unit but I quickly became used to it. The super light weight is a real plus and the battery life is excellent. I have only charged it once and have read 3 books. The only issue I have is that I am still having trouble navigating to the main icons, especially after finishing a book and getting the ""rate this book"" page which I am sure if I googled would overcome that problem. Overall, a good choice."
burger,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I much prefer the features of the Kindle touch. The Collections/Recent/Title/Author, the My Items/Books/Dock, and the Cloud/Device keys on the home page work much more directly and with fewer key strokes in the Kindle Touch then moving through the menu tree in the Kindle Paperwhite(10th Generation) . The Paperwhite has to be restarted frequently when loading collections with many books. The battery life of the Paperwhite is less then half of the Kindle Touch even when I turn on the Airplane mode when not used. The only advantage to the Paperwhite is lighted page."
Paul,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only been able to download to the paperwhite from amazon, not from Hoopla or any other media. What gives I can do it on my fire and not on this device. If I had know this I might not have even bought it. I after posting this review with a 2 star rating within minutes received a call from a concerned Amazon employee. They asked my opinions,my reasons for the rating, and said they would pass it on. If all your downloads were to be from amazon, I would give it a 5 star rating. I just think that any reader should be more adaptable and not just tied to their product line. Great pad to read on."
Justin Lim,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle is a very good device for reading, that goes without saying. The option of 32 GB is quite good, and it is light. I do really encourage you to purchase one. The good of kindle is emphasized in its advertising materials so there is o need to reiterate them.

The things which are not advertised are as follows:

1. Battery life: I read 30 minutes - 1 hour daily given my hectic schedule, 50% of the time with half brightness and during the day, without. But after 1 hour of reading, I would lose about 20% of the battery life without light. So, that leaves me with 5 days of reading before the device needs full charge, since i first had the device. Impressive? - not really. I have used previous generations of kindle paperwhite, and their battery life can last literally for a month before recharging. for this device, the expectations may fall significantly below than expected.

2. Overall feel: the design is alright, and it can be carried in a hand when reading. But, the feel is kind of cheap. the back cover material can be sticky if left over a long period of time especially in countries of high humidity and weather. so you will need to clean it constantly especially after much use and in contact with your hands. Wipe down your device frequently.

3. White spots - after a few months of usage, you will realize that white spots start to appear on your screen. hence any text or image may be slightly affected by them. If I am not mistaken, the e-ink technology uses tiny particles that turn to black or white to give the text/image its appearance. Perhaps, there are some particles which do not work overtime due to constant changing of the particle white/black colours.

4. Screen response - the screen response can be at times, very efficient (in fact overly efficient) as it can be very sensitive (which is not bad) but it can also be unresponsive.

General verdict:
this is a great device nevertheless. there are constant updates to the kindle, and amazon has been working on them to improvise on its interface and usability. But bear in mind that the battery life may not be advertised, and be prepared to carry a cable to charge if you are an avid reader. Battery does drain even on wifi, but with bluetooth turned off."
Kira,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So this is my first kindle i was confused which one should i buy I didn’t want too expensive but i wanted a good one for a long term. I was so mad cause my macbook it’s broke so needed to figure out how can i put books on it without buying. It was so complicated while we figured out how this email stuff works and we still don’t know everything cause I’m Hungarian and i need Hungarian books and it’s not simple just find some. So i was very mad and disappointed but we figured out i have some book on it already and i love it!
I am very oldschool about books i love the real old books and i used to ordered books from back home and my mom sent it.
It was a lot of money and time now i can buy online and read comfortably anywhere even in the bath! I read a lot aand the battery not longer than one and half week
Except its kinda complicate i love this machine its comfortable for the eyes and i can read anyime anywhere.
Thanks kindle!"
ETW In WA,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed that for the money that I paid for it this would have lasted longer than the one year I had it. Funny that the original kindle I purchase more than 5 years ago is still working great, it just doesn't have the white background and hold capacity but at least it still works! I guess technology is not alway progessing at top speed and functionality in all ways. A little concerned that the ""next generation wonder"" I just bought for my son's birthday will also be a disappointment in a few months."
N. Christian,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted a waterproof unit and when I traded in my last one and got this model, I was starting to think I made a mistake. There were constant problems with the wifi not picking up after the unit had been in sleep mode for awhile. This happened for 2 - 3 weeks solid and after repeated calls with tech support. Finally it seemed to self-correct (which astonished me) because there was also a large battery drain that even leaving in sleep mode would see the unit having to be recharged every few days (I only purchased in early December). Being cautiously optimistic, I wait to give this review but now wifi turns on near instantly when I wake the unit (versus taking prodding that sometimes took hours and resetting) and now holds a charge perfectly. Maybe the unit needed to calibrate, maybe they fixed something with a patch I haven't noticed. But I can finally recommend it, but beware of initial products. I don't normally buy first runs and this is why. But they did help."
Teresa S,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I like the new Kindle but there are a couple things I don't like. First, the on/off button on the bottom has a hair trigger. I have accidently turned it off when read just by brushing against the button. Second, my older Kindle had an option to always show the time at the top of the page. Can't seem to find any way to do that with the new Kindle. These are the only two negatives I have found so far. I bought this version of the Kindle because it is waterproof. I like to read by the pool and in the tub. If I accidently drop the Kindle in the water, it will not be ruined."
karen,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this for just a week and I am frustrated and disappointed. This is my 4th Kindle and so far, the worst of them all. The battery life is horrible. I also had installed the extra ad-free program and yet, I still get ads, so also drain my battery. I have spent at least 10 hours of my life with customer service via chat and on the phone and no one seems to have the knowledge to fix these problems. The kindle also has an update, but every time I try to update it to the new system, I get an error code. I want to love this Kindle, but right now, I hate it"
Mena,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I should have read the reviews before I made this purchase, but I've never had a Kindle I didn't like before. I hate this one. It takes forever to wake up, the touch screen sucks, and I have seen no evidence of the promised longer battery life. If this was the first Kindle I'd ever purchased, I would never buy another one."
Krista,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Received this as a gift from my son!! He knew I was a little frustrated with the weight and size of my tablet for reading books. And of course, on the phone...they are fine on the fly...but to read very long...you become cross-eyed!!
This is perfect. Not too heavy, and compact to easily slip into my purse or briefcase. Easy to adjust the font size...so if you are getting a little tired, a quick adjustment can be made to make the print bigger.!! Looking forward to reading many more electronic books.!!"
Pamela L. Ingmire,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Imagine my surprise - I went to transfer content from my old Paperwhite to this new one and the games didn't transfer. So I tried to manually transfer and that didn't work. Then I got to customer support ... and yadda yadda ya 3 hours and 5 reps later a ""concern"" rep says ""the new Paperwhite does not support games."" I say, why isn't that in the pre-sales information? And why don't your other reps know this? He says, I'll send that to the team. Yea, sure. Turns out, I'll be sleepless in Colorado without a nightly sudoku. First world problem I know -- but still."
Nikki S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had a Kindle since the beginning, right back with the Kindle keyboards. We've had Kindle fire's and I got a first generation Paperwhite when the Kindle keyboard died and loved it. I got this one for my husband and I have to say I'm jealous.

The interface is good, it looks great and I like the text to speech option. You need a Bluetooth device and some patience to get it set up but it does what is needed and the voice is decent for computer generated.

Totally recommend"
JWC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Coming from reading on an older Kindle with physical buttons and a high end Android phone, reading on the Paperwhite has taken a bit of getting used to. I'm finding the interface unintuitive. Simple things like turning the backlight up or down, changing font size, or even going back a page take more clicks than I'd expect or require touching just the right area of the screen and waiting a beat to see whether or not the Kindle responds. I'm sure I'll get used to this, but I was unpleasantly surprised at the awkwardness.

Other than that, this is everything it's advertised to be - light, waterproof (last Kindle bit the dust in a backpack in the rain, so...), and with a crisp, bright display."
Cassandra,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For a very long time I debated whether to get a Kindle Paperwhite or to continue reading on my Amazon Fire tablet. I loved the Fire tablet and thought I would miss having the color covers, the ease of loading ebooks, and the additional apps. To be honest, I really don’t miss the Fire Tablet at all -the Kindle Paperwhite is very easy to use and is perfect for an avid reader who spends a lot of their spare time with their nose in an ebook. The battery life is much longer than the tablet, although for me it doesn’t last as long as I had expected since I use it all the time. :)

If you’re an avid reader on the fence, you will be happy with this one."
Chandler Upchurch,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a 1st time Kindle Paperwhite user so I wasn't sure what to expect. So far I love it. It's small without being TOO SMALL and it doesn't glare like normal screens do in the light. It's also got amazing battery life. My only complaint is it's a bit slower than the traditional tablet, and the screen blinks a little bit when you're in the kindle store. But if you don't mind that and you want a very affordable very good product to conveniently read books on the go, or just decrease your paper consumption then this is for you.

Now onto the shady stuff. The ""Special Offers"" means Amazon is allowed to play ads all over your Kindle. When the screen is locked, in the kindle store, like all the time, except for when you're actively reading a book. And to turn this off you have to pay an additional 20 dollars to Amazon, on top of what you're already paying for your Kindle.
The 1st time you turn your kindle on and get it set up, it will offer you 1 month free to the KIndle Exclusive package thingy, decline it and don't get it. Because right after you accept that Amazon will send you an email with a 3 months free offer. Do accept that one. Only it won't be 3 months free, they'll charge your card after a month. Then you'll get mad and decide to cancel it,and then they'll offer you 5 months for 2 dollars and it SAYS ""You will not be charged until May 2020."" LIARSSSS they immediately charged my card the 2 dollars. Immediately. Like WoW....
Anyway so like avoid all the shady offers and you'll be good."
c,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm coming to this kindle from an original keyboard-style kindle. The backlight and improved screen quality are a big improvement and the slightly smaller size is nice. Battery life is good enough, but not quite the 'forget about it for weeks at a time' good that my previous kindle was.

Two specific things they could improve:
1) The time left in chapter/book is buggy and works inconsistently. This is apparently a long-standing problem with modern kindles. Amazon - how hard is this to fix? Please add the 'pages left in chapter/book' status back - this isn't an option in this kindle and it definitely should be.
2) The page back/forward doesn't work very well to quickly turn pages. You can only change a page about once every second or so - going back 10 pages to check something and then forward again takes an annoyingly long amount of time."
PS,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My older Kindle purchased in 2014 lasts longer in battery life. I only had to charge my old one about once a week and I read daily, several books a week. The new Kindle is false advertisement. Maybe if you never turned it on, left if asleep, it may last a week. Battery drains fast when reading and I have to charge it daily if I read for 2hrs or more. If I only read for about an hour - I can go 2 days without recharging. I personally say - keep your old one if it's fully functional. Due to horrible battery life, I will definitely be taking my older one on trips."
Kalyani,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle Paperwhite is light, does not feel heavy after holding for a good amount of time. I have used it in a cafe(indoors) and in a park(outdoors), I did not have light issues. It is bright. The sound on audible books is high so you do not need to worry about if you are at the airport or outdoors, it is loud enough. I can operate it with one hand, more or less.
The only issue I have sometimes is the touch. The touch is more rougher than the other devices we use daily. But if you want to choose from a screen that looks like paper and okay fine touch, I would choose the screen that looks like paper. That's the charm of Kindle."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned 3 Paperwhites and this was the first one with significant changes. I hoped they were improvements but it has pretty much been a disappointment.
First what is good the screen, I prefer the smooth front. That's the only improvement.

Now for the bad. I was looking forward to pairing it to my headphones and listening to my own music while I read instead of the canned music at Starbucks. You can't.
I was looking forward to listening to my own books. You can't.
I even bought the model with extra storage and so far it is useless. Apparently the only thing you can listen to is Audible. Next improvement will be the only thing I can read is Kindle.
And lastly it is slower and the battery doesn't last as long.

Add: My Advise, if you don't use Audible, just order the 8gb. If I had known that going in I would have been happy with my new Kindle. The smooth face, the smaller size, waterproofing all good things to make it a really good Kindle."
John V.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently switched from an older Kindle model with keyboard and non-backlit screen to the new Kindle Paperwhite. I was pleasantly surprised with the new features. The backlight is great and only shows up in low-light situations. In full sun it’s just like my old Kindle’s display, which I’m glad about because I didn’t want to feel like I was looking at a computer screen on the beach or outdoors. I am now camping in a tent with my wife and the adjustable backlight is just strong enough for me to read the display at night without bothering my wife as she sleeps. I used to do the same thing on my kindle phone app, but that would drain my phone battery, which is hard to charge while camping and bike touring. Battery life of the new kindle is great and I only have to charge it once every 2 - 3 weeks. The smaller size is easier to hold in one’s hand. Small things I would change: making the backlight color adjustable so I could change it from the cool white color to a warmer color at night. Also I miss the page-forward buttons on the side of the device. Touching the screen to change each page is a bit tedious."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Kindle Fire owner for a long time now, however it is limited as a reader in the sun. So I thought a natural purchase would be a dedicated e-reader. Unfortunately I do not like the product. While the product turns on & works as intended, I find the operating programming clunky. I have used the product for about four months now & working with my “Library” still causes me frustration. While the Fire was not perfect when navigating a book, I found the Fire better at it than the e-reader."
Mar,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Other than this is my third kindle and second Paper White.
Very reliable device! but the new one is slower to start: they even have a message ""Waking Up""
I've had pages turning flicker, to the point that I need to go back to make I'm on the correct page.
These things that never happened on my old Paper White.
With minimum care your battery will last a fairly long time between recharge but even several years on.
But you'll need a new case because if the size is exactly the same they manage to change enough of the edges' profile that the old one won't fit.
I didn't test their claim of water resistance."
Sharon,5.0 out of 5 stars,".
I LIKE MY KINDLE BECAUSE I CAN TAKE IT ANYWHERE & I ALWAYS HAVE MY BOOK WITH ME! I USUALLY END UP READING OVERNIGHT WHICH IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT, BUT I CAN READ IN DAYTIME, TOO BECAUSE THE LIGHT IS ADJUSTABLE. I ALSO APPRECIATE THE ""WORD WISE"" TO HELP WITH DEFINITION OF WORDS. I HAVE A DISCOVERED A NEW LOVE OF READING SINCE I'VE HAD THE KINDLE & APPRECIATE THAT I JUST TAKE IT ANYWHERE WITH ME. I HAVE A CUTE CASE FOR IT SO IT WON'T SLIP OUT OF MY HAND. I HAVE MANY BOOKS WAITING TO BE READ, MOST OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FREE!"
ChristieV,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great reader. Transition from dark to light and back is awesome with the back light on. Especially since I work graveyard and stock the house at night. I don’t want to wake anyone up because I need light to read from room to room. Easy set up, easy care, cleans easily with a polishing cloth. I just love my kindle! Just a little slow to turn pages or the opposite happens and it jumps a page. Not a deal breaker though. Doesn’t happen often. Haven’t tried out the Bluetooth yet but will soon."
James D Gardner,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am now on my third new kindle paperwhite since November. I bought the new edition in November having had great experiences with previous kindles, dating back to the original version. Despite being told multiple times by customer service that the problem I am experiencing is not reported by others, I have had the same problem with all 3 new devices. What are the odds that I got 3 successive devices that malfunctioned and it is not a flaw in the product? With returning my first two devices my money was refunded and then I purchased a new paperwhite. When I bought the third one about 2-3 weeks ago I found that I now had to pay $30 more than the original purchase in November. The problem I am experiencing is that while reading, not after a minute or two of inactivity, the device shots down and at times I can just restart it and often the device needs to be rebooted. Very frustrating! Not enough to make me go back to reading hard copy books but frustrating enough to make me wonder if I need to read on a device other than kindle. Until this experience I have done most of my reading on a kindle and have been very satisfied. Also, this is the first time I have been disappointed with Amazon customer service. Requiring me to pay $30 more to replace a device that malfunctioned."
Mimi,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my new kindle (my old one of 9 years finally died)!! This new one is so light and easy to use. Love the built in light! The cover seems sturdy in case I drop it. Adjusting to all the new features but love it so far!!
jfc,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this to replace a Paperwhite from late 2012. This new one's battery life cannot hold a candle to my old one, even after seven years of heavy use.

There is no good way to transfer books from one device to another (that I have found), as content is tied to a device. Last night, starting from a full charge, I downloaded about 300 of my old books. I left the WiFi on and the books downloading when I went to sleep, and woke up to find the brand new battery had drained about 65% in four hours. I thought that was a lot, but I also realized I'd downloaded a lot of content. Fair enough. I fell back asleep and woke up two or so hours later to find that the battery had dropped from 35% to 18% - I had not been using it and no additional books had been downloaded. 17% battery depletion on a new device in two hours with just having the WiFi on...yikes.

Needless to say, I'm rather disappointed. This is my third Kindle (and I've purchased at least two others as gifts), and I felt assured in buying this one given my past experiences. Amazon should work towards a firmware update that will put the Kindle into sleep mode, or at least not drain the battery for no reason. Advertising weeks of battery life (sure, I get it that that's only the case if the WiFi is off and it's not being used) when the actual product delivers about 12 hours if the WiFi is on is pretty bad, especially because Amazon seemed to have this problem figured out seven years ago with its old devices..."
MAHE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first kindle I ever own. I am really enjoying it as I can carry with me everywhere, the screen resolution is great, only thing is that sometimes feels a bit slow to respond when navigating the Home screen, nothing major, only noticeable when compared to iPad or regular tablets -not sure if that's expected on the Kindles or is just mine..."
Carla Castro,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this product at a Best Buy. I was so conflicted because all I did was read the bad reviews, but I love this thing. I don't read six hours a day but about an hour probably less every night and I haven't had to plug it in for like two weeks! The screen is fine and I haven't any delays in turning the pages. I did get the Kindle that the cord doesn't work but I used my phone charger and it was fine. I would recommend this product."
michele,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great little reader. It contains books, has wifi, is light and durable and lasts a long time before recharging. What more could you want?

I really can't figure out why people are saying the battery doesn't last. I read for 2-3 hours a day and have yet to charge it since I got it 2 weeks ago. Like, really I have no idea what those people could be doing to make their kindle die after a few hours. Maybe audiobooks with the screen brightness to 100% while constantly pressing all the buttons on the screen? No clue.

I also find the charger doesn't give me any problems as people claim. Maybe some folks like to jam it in blind and give it a good smack with a hammer for good measure. If you're a calm and reasonable person, these things will likely not vex you.

This thing does exactly what you need it to do. Great product, highly recommended."
Lawrence Ober,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My last Kindle was a five and a half year old Paperwhite with the raised bezel. Early on it developed a bright pinhole in the lower right corner of the screen. Not a big deal once I got used to it. Then, recently, it developed about a 3/8"" tear and bright line in the screen where the last line of text appears. It was my second e-ink kindle to fail but 5 1/2 years was a tolerable lifespan for modern electronics and with the screen tear it had to go.

Enter the latest Kindle Paperwhite without a raised bezel. It is too small and is somewhat uncomfortable to hold. Between the slightly smaller size and lack of the raised bezel my left thumb is constantly drifting onto the screen and flipping the pages back (I'm left-handed). I find myself constantly having to flip through multiple pages, back and forth, to get back to where I was reading. IRRITATING. Holding it by the back without using my thumbs hold the front frame is difficult and often painful (I have some arthritis in my hands). I see no value in the current bezel-less design trend. The older model had vastly superior ergonomics. Smaller is not always better. If I can't make the adjustment to conforming my body to the new design mandate, my days of joyful e-reading will be gone. Going back to paper hardcovers may end up being the best but expensive choice."
Jessica,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When you buy a new kindle you would expect your old books would transfer. Turns out they don’t and after a bunch of tech support you get told you have to download each individually. Also it’s a worse kindle than my paper white that is 7 years old. Screen is less responsive, light is bad and the battery worse."
Priscilla Bettis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm surprised at how much I like my water-resistant Kindle. (I don't plan on actually dropping it in the water to see if it's waterPROOF.) I was never able to soak in a hot bath and read an ebook before. Now I can.:-)

The texture of the case is nice. It feels good to hold, and it's still grippy if your hands get a little sweaty. It easily wipes clean.

My Kindle for PC app is easier to navigate on my touch screen laptop, but other than that, I love my new Kindle Paperwhite!"
Rick Mills,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This paperwhite is now my favorite. The screen brightness is easily adjustable from black to white, perfect for reading in bed (or around the campfire) without disturbing others. It is also readable in full sunlight (unlike the Kindle Fire). I got the suggested flip cover with it, and closing the cover puts the Kindle to sleep, and opening the cover wakes it up again; which saves fooling with screen swipes each time. I also like the ability to email content to it. I downloaded some books from Project Gutenberg and emailed them to the Kindle, and they came in perfectly, images and all. This Kindle is now my go-to device for bringing along on trips, to bed, to camping."
S Wilgus,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Customer service got a hold of me and said they would send me a reconditioned kindle even though I paid full price for this one and I argued with the rep about it since this one cost so much. I finally agreed and they sent me one with different software that worked for two weeks and then wouldn’t turn on any more, I will have to live with the poor battery life because at least it turns on. If they offer you a reconditioned model, be very suspicious. Original post: The battery life is terrible. Frankly, my older paperwhite is better. I turned off the wifi to see if that would help the battery life. It doesn't."
Riverview,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like that it has improved the readability. The first new one I got had to be returned because the charger cable would not fit into the Kindle. The replacement is better but I do worry that it may cause me problems in the future.
Overall, I am a bit disappointed."
Claudia G. Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new Kindle, bought because I lost my previous one. This model is better for me without the page turning buttons on the Voyager model, which I was always hitting by mistake. I may be wrong, but it seems to have a little less battery life - maybe I am just reading more after missing my lost one while I waited to get the replacement. I could not do without my Kindle! I still read printed books, but I love the security of always having reading material right at hand and at night before I go to sleep. An essential for us bibliophiles."
TLM,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My main beef with this product is that the side margins where u hold it are so small that I’m constantly Going to the next page by accident. No matter how I try not to, the sides are just too small to hold properly and not hit the writing and turn to the next page. It also wakes very slowly. Other than those two things, it’s basically the same as the other Paperwhites."
Sione Tuiasoa,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly I would give it a 0 if possible. I love the kindle paper white earlier version and have had and used it for years. I just got the new version and am having troubles from the get. It won’t turn on after a full charge, it requires me to hold down the power button for 40 seconds to turn it on. When I do that, it has to upload as if turning on for the first time. Then to top it off, after being fully charged and coming home, with under 30 minutes of use while at work, it’s battery has been depleted by 30%. I don’t see this as something that will fox on its own, so I’m returning this and the case back. I’ll get the old version, hopefully it’s still as good as I remember."
Justin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything about this device is great. Battery life is very long, performance is snappy, it's lightweight, handsome, water resistant and durable otherwise and the screen and backlight are just wonderful. Kudos to the folks at Amazon that refined their designs to this device, I have no complaints and plan on using it for a long time to come."
Howard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an impressive device, the first kindle I have owned. The digital ink technology is impressive and there is no glare when reading the kindle. The kindle is also very lightweight and I even enjoy looking at the sleep screen ads. My only issue is the screen refresh and touch sensitivity. The screen is almost refreshing every page I change and sometimes I have to press real hard for my touch to input. Also, you need a bluetooth device to be able to listen from the kindle. Overall, I would recommend trying one."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle! This is my third.
However, the claim that a single battery charge lasts weeks is an OUTRIGHT LIE!
I can only imagine that they used an estimate of the number of hours the average American reads a week--which, of course is a very low number as it includes those who do not read at all and those who barely read two books a year.
However, if you are contemplating spending this much money on a reading device--you are clearly a reader!
I am a reader. I might three days out of a charge!"
Shilo S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a Kindle Fire HD 10"" and cannot read on it. But with the Kindle Paperwhite I can read and read and read. I'ts non glare and just like reading a book. I have problems with Vertigo and my balance so my eyes have trouble tracking words. But now i can read again. Had trouble marking the page with the tab and called Amazon for help and they were great. So I love my paperwhite reader."
OldSailor,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Being able to read in the dark is a plus.
The page swipe, especially for paging backwards is sometimes difficult but I have large hands which may be the real problem.
The battery charge of my original kindle was measured in months, especially if not in use. It had a serial number of 199, so was actually one of the very first. It had buttons to turn the pages.
I was told there was zero use of electricity except to change the page. once the printing appeared no more electricity was required to keep it there.

This one lasts about 3 weeks of just setting unused before it requires recharging. I'n assuming the paper white requires some small trickle to keep the page on the screen, and certainly while reading it requires quite a lot more for the light, therefore requires recharging more often.
It's smaller size is quite convenient. It will fit easily in a coat pocket. or a large shirt pocIket.
The original fit in the back pocket of my jeans but accidentally sitting on it broke it.
It is annoying that amazon insist on advertising new books on the screen when it's off.
Most times the selections are not to my tastes, and some are steamy romance novels which is kinda embarrassing when you pull out your kindle in an air port or waiting room with people looking to see what you're reading.
However that's a 'feature' that some people may like."
timbitsandbytes,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that e-readers have become so light, easy to use, affordable, and figured out how to include a light without detracting from the glare-less e-ink screen.

My only 2 issues, which are nits, are this:
1) adjusting the light takes a few taps. It’s not a big issue since I eventually found an ideal brightness and stick with that. I only mention it in case you’re the type to frequently change it.
2) The button to wake it up is on the bottom. I used to prop it up on a shelf but doing so turns itself off."
Lori,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not even close to what I expected, especially for the price! If I was completely dismayed at how low quality the books, store, everything appears. I bought it in a hurry to take on vacation and ended up receiving a Fire 7 from a friend to use instead (and if you are familiar with the 7, you know that even THAT is a whole other bag of issues). Anyway, no, I'm definitely not happy with my latest Kindle. If you are spending that much, you might as well get the Fire 10!"
Dan Hazy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After having it a few days, ONE major problem I would like to see corrected.

the power/sleep button is placed on the bottom, exactly where I hold the device. I need to hold it at an odd angle to not put it to sleep!! this should be corrected!! a very annoying design flaw !! that should have been fixed YEARS ago. Why was it not put on the top? It sounds minor, but for some of us it is a FLAW, there are other places we could ALL agree is better.

Does anyone really use the product before manufacturing it ?? I cannot be that different."
Jeanne Dunn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I HAVE BEEN READING ON A KINDLE FIRE HD FOR MANY YEARS, AND I HAVE LOVED IT! UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS NOT USER-FRIENDLY IN THE SUNLIGHT. THE KINDLE PAPER WHITE CAN BE READ OUTDOORS IN THE SUN, AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO ENJOYING THAT FEATURE ALL SUMMER AND BEYOND. IT IS A PLEASURE NOT TO SEE MY FACE LOOKING BACK AT ME, BUT RATHER TO SEE THE BOOK I AM READING CLEARLY. THE PAPER-WHITE IS SO EASY TO TAKE WITH ME AS IT WEIGHS ABOUT HALF AS MUCH AS THE FIRE, AND IT IS SMALLER IN SIZE. THE SIZE OF THE PAGE LENDS ITSELF TO FAST READING AS THE LINES ARE SHORT ENOUGH FOR YOUR EYES TO TRAVEL QUICKLY DOWN THE PAGE. MANY ADJUSTMENTS IN FONT SIZE, FONT STYLE AND PAGE INFORMATION ARE AVAILABLE. THE BATTERY LIFE IS ASTOUNDING. I CAN READ FOR HOURS WITH NO PROBLEM..STILL PLENTY OF BATTERY LEFT.

THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT OCCURRED FOR ME, WHEN I FIRST STARTED USING IT, WAS THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT PUT ANY APPS ON IT, AND I AM ACCUSTOMED TO GETTING MY BOOKS FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARY VIA OVERDRIVE. TECH SUPPORT SHOWED ME THAT THIS CAN STILL BE DONE ON THE PAPER-WHITE USING MY FIRE TO ORDER THE BOOKS... A PROCEDURE THAT WAS MUCH TOO CUMBERSOME FOR ME. I DISCOVERED LIBBY WHICH IS ALSO BY OVERDRIVE. IT IS AN APP THAT YOU CAN PUT ON YOUR PHONE. YOU CAN ORDER BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY USING YOUR SMART PHONE AND THEN SEND THEM TO YOUR PAPER-WHITE. IT WORKS REALLY WELL. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THAT PROCEDURE. ALL I CAN SAY IS...I LOVE MY PAPER-WHITE!!!"
Trevor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pure and simple: if you don’t want to keep a giant collection of paper books around, and don’t want to buy paper because you’re anti-deforestation, this thing is for you. I love it because if I’m reading outside by the pool, it’s waterproof and doesn’t require a backlight due to the screen design. On the flip side, I can read this at night without having a light on, which my girlfriend really appreciates. You can store so much on this device too; I got the larger 32 GB because it was on a flash sale, mostly so I can store audiobooks, etc."
telcomm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this as a Yule gift this year and it's blown me away! Though I truly loved my 2013 Kindle, the Paperwhite far out classes it. The resolution on it is insane. The letters and diagrams are so crisp and clear that they look like they've been printed with the highest quality laser printer. I love being able to see my book covers in my library, which I was not able to do with my 2013 Kindle. The backlight is perfectly even and is handy for when I don't want to put my book down after my spouse has gone to sleep. I'm excited to test the waterproofness next. It was always my dream to be able to read in the shower but I was never able to do so with a paper book (obviously). I was excited when the Kindle Oasis waterproof came out, but it was way beyond our price range. I'm so glad we get a waterproof device in a more affordable package. It feels sturdy and durable, too. I like the extra weight compared to my 2013 Kindle. It feels more like a paper book that way (because I tend to read large tomes). Now the only thing I have to do is decide what case to get!"
RickW,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a big fan of the Paperwhites. This one is fine. However, my OLD Paperwhite was also fine, except that Amazon declined to update its connection security, and it could no longer reach Wikipedia. This was the only reason I got the new Paperwhite. And while I like it fine, I think it's annoying that it is slightly different in size from other Paperwhite models, enough different to require me to buy a new cover as well. I am usually a big Amazon / Kindle booster, but not at the moment."
Bubbliemom,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really love having a kindle just for reading. There is one thing that I wish they would not have changed, and that is down on the bottom left corner, you used to have the option of just tapping on the location, page, how much time was left in a chapter and how much time was left in the book, all you had to do as tap that bottom corner to rotate through your options. Amazon has done away with that option and I miss it, I used it more than I thought I did while reading. Now you have to tap the top to go into the options for the book to see all that information. The other thing I love is being able to listen to my audible books on it. I also love the bigger storage on the paperwhite. Overall, the improvements are nice."
Lenore S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband bought me this as an early Christmas present along with the leather cover. I have never owned one before and I would highly recommend it to anybody. I can just order another book on Kindle from Amazon and it downloads onto my Kindle Paperwhite with Kindle Unlimited.

You can change the font easily, the back light Is great and the charge lasts a long time if you shut it off and don't leave it open when you're done reading.

December 27, 2019 … I received this as an early Christmas present and I can honestly say that I am truly enjoying my Kindle Paper White still."
Andrea Solanye,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this back in late July, and since it arrived late (2 day shipping prime? Ja! what a joke!) I had to wait to be bale to get my hands on it (I live outside the US and we don't have Amazon here), and I had to pay an additional fee to be able to get the product. I was so excited for getting my new Kindle, I have decided to stop buying paperback books due to environmental reasons and lack of space. Unfortunately this last month I have been very busy which meant that I couldn't use the Kindle as I had hoped (I only charged it once), I was just using it like 1-2 hours a week! Big surprise when this weekend I was going to keep reading my book and the screen was frozen!

I followed every instruction that I was able to find in the help pages and the forums, pushing the power bottom for 40 secs, plugging it to the computer, using the charger to the wall, using a different cable, doing everything with and without the case, waiting more than 40 secs, etc. The freaking light never went on! The screen is frozen with the Kindle logo and doesn't change from there!

I called kindle support and turns out that I need to send the product back to US so a technician can check it and they will send it back to me when it's fixed. The problem is that it only works if you are in the US! So now I have to spend more money in sending this to US to have it fixed and then more money to have it ship back to me. Crazy! Amazon is supposed to be the most customer obsessed company in the world, and can ship a product internationally but can't provide international support???

Now I'm trying to find someone who can take my kindle to a UPS counter in US to have a product that has less than a month of use fixed. LESS THAN A MONTH!!! I should have invested in an iPad instead on this bull***t!"
S’anne,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my second kindle. It’s a bit lighter than my first one and has a longer battery life. I really like the connection with Goodreads. Kindle software is easy to navigate.
Serena,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my first kindle and I love it. I’ve had nooks in the past and haven’t liked anything this much since the original nook. I can read outside or inside with no glare and the battery life so far is awesome. Still getting used to the home page layout but otherwise this is a total winner.
Roadrunner,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Paperwhite is a great improvement on the older models of Kindle. There have been other improvements, too …. but I'm still looking for the reader on which I can get the full value of a serious book that contains graphics, charts, maps, etc. For example, currently reading Ron Chernow's biography of Ulysses S. Grant, there are maps of the military campaigns but these can't be expanded enough to make them legible on the small screen. Until we have that, Kindle is only useful for reading fiction."
E. P. Millard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like it so far, though I can agree about some of the inadequacies others have mentioned. I prefer to think the good outweighed the.bad on this purchase, especially when I received it around Xmas at a very deep discount by trading in another kindle. I like that it’s lightweight and very appropriately sized for carrying in a purse. I also like it for bathtub reading. I like the 32 Gb storage capacity. I tried the audible feature but do not use it yet (so far). I’m still keeping last years kindle, though, in case this one poops out! The battery does seem to die faster but recharges amazingly fast, so I don’t notice that problem very much."
J,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Like the last gen model, this feels great and has good lighting. It's great that it's waterproof now, although I haven't tested that feature. It's very strange that it doesn't adjust for daylight saving time. Apparently only some models can handle that. It's also disappointing that this doesn't have a USB-C port. Everything else (in terms of mobile) uses USB-C, so I need an extra cable for this."
MDP123,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We had a Kindle Paperwhite 4 generations older that was finally starting to slow down. I got my wife this one to replace and it overall she is very happy. Size is just different enough we had to get a new case. VERY happy with the more waterproof aspect as well as the smoothness of the screen (no indention from rim to screen. Good job Amazon on subtle but solid improvements. For us the memory increase was not that big of a deal as we were not even close to using the storage, BUT with the addition of supporting audio now, that could change."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Using this product to download books. Worth about four stars, give or take some decimal fractions. Just too bad that this device is very finicky as to data-transfer techniques. (For examples of data-transfer finickiness: cannot tether or bluetooth-tether / ""hot-spot"" this device to an Internet device that I already also own; also, this Kindle-device doesn't accept either 3G or 4G either. This device only accepts standard WiFi, such as featured in some physical stores and coffee-shops.) Four stars."
toxKyeso,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want good battery LIFE ... then turn on Airplane Mode (it turns off bluetooth, wifi which can use lots of juice). Also, if you want super long battery life turn the brightness down a little.

Some people have complained about not charging right. Well, this model does NOT come with a charger so if you are using a lower powered one, it will not charge right or will take long time.

Also, if you have any problems with the unit, look at YouTube videos to get tips of how to use it and pointers.

I have had it a few months and like this kindle."
JDET,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I treated myself to my Paperwhite 10th generation as a Christmas gift and I'm so glad I did. Although I have several Kindle Fires I find them a little too heavy to hold for hours as I'm reading. I hoped the Paperwhite would work better and it certainly does. It's so much lighter and very easy to use. My only issue is they could have made it much easier to find the invert white/black function. It's under settings, accessibility rather than in the change font, etc. area which is where I think anyone with any common sense would look for it."
bethany,4.0 out of 5 stars,It does not have the features of the app you can download to your regular tablet. That is my big complaint. Battery life is pretty good I can read through a couple of books easily before recharging. I like the size. I like to use it for my reading. I wish I could upload non Kindle docs to it. But then the memory may not be good enough if that were possible I think as I think compression would be less on non Kindle files. The memory for Kindle files is more than sufficient..I read quite a bit...I give it four stars.
Robyn Gordon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle and I am a big fan so far. I am a book lover who has always preferred paper books, but I am becoming an e-book convert just because it's so nice to be able to have so many titles available in a light-weight device that I can carry with me all the time. I only have a few complaints: 1) I wish the page number locator preference could allow you to reference the actual page number in the printed book, instead of changing based on how large your e-book font is set to (even at the smallest font size, the kindle screen is smaller than a book page and can fit less). I don't like seeing the book have 600+ pages when in reality its a 250 page book. This is minor though. 2) I find the screen a bit slow to load - both when you initially turn the kindle on and when you turn pages. It's a pretty slight delay that I'm sure I'll get used to, but I find it a bit frustrating so far. 3) I wish you could go forwards and backwards when holding the device with one hand - currently you touch the left to go back and the right to go forward, but if your hands are small like mine you can't go backwards when holding the device on the right. 4) I wish the library could be organized better. I find it hard to navigate to find the right book and that it's slow to sort through many pages of library books.

Otherwise - I'm a big fan - and hopefully Amazon can change some of these things in future kindle versions."
J Michael McDade,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I generally read over 50 new books a year. The new Paperwhite has increased storage, and quick retrieval. The new model is remarkably thin and smaller, without reducing screen size. The waterproof feature is welcome, since I like to read everywhere, even in the bathtub! The lighting is better than ever, and very easy to read. Only complaint is that battery life is overstated. I need to recharge about every 4-5 days. Truly one of America's great inventions. Particularly helpful for travel."
Eisner U.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Concerning the instrument - Kindle Paperwhite is comfortable for handling and reading.
Concerning the Kindle Unlimited subscription – it is a deception. With the purchase of the instrument I did a 3-month subscription, based on your advertisement “members read free with KindleUnlimited”. I was deeply frustrated to discover that not all books are included and more importantly the list of KindleUnlimited is of null interest to me. I would appreciate it if you allow me to buy books from the general list for the amount of money corresponding to the 3-month subscription.
According to your record the 3-month subscription does not start from the date I registered (October30), but from the date of purchase, which is few weeks earlier."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a Kindle paperwhite late last year (2019) for the sole purpose of reading ebooks from our public library. Nothing in the user manual or anywhere else seemed to address this process, and a number of statements were totally misleading or maybe applied to other Kindle models. Most of the confusion is based on the assumption that you can use your Kindle paperwhite to do this- But You Can’t! Rather, you have to use a computer or mobile device with a fully-functioning browser.

Here is the process that I have finally gotten to work: 1. From your computer/mobile device, login to Overdrive.com; 2. Click “Find Library”; 3. Find/select your public library/branch, and click on “Visit Library website; 4. Login to your library account; 5. Click on Kindle Books; 6. Find/select desired book; 7. Click on “Borrow” for book; 8. Select “Read now with Kindle”, and you are transferred to Amazon; 9. Log in to your Amazon account, and it will open to your book; 10. In upper right, select book to be delivered to your Kindle device.

This process works for me, but you may have to tweek it a bit based on your own public library."
melissa rodriguez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my best purchase of 2019 hands down. I'm the kind of reader that is addicted to fan fiction on ao3 and the built in experimental browser is the perfect place to search up my faves and download them. They work together like magic. And it is so nice to have all my favorite stories stored in one place.

The screen is super nice on my eyes and most times I like to use it without the blue light. The blue light works well and it is not bad on my eyes but I just love yellow lamplight on the screen best.

The device is so light to hold and it is the most comfortable thing I have ever read anything on. Easy to turn the pages from any reading position with either hand due to the great screen sensitivity. The size of it is perfect for novels. Manga could pose a small challenge to read if you have trouble with tiny text due to the way some artists illustrate their pages but it has great integration for manga reading. The only thing I would not use this for is colored comics since you won't get the full experience.

The battery so far lasts anywhere from 3 days to a week depending on how long I read. Going by reviews I've seen I was expecting a bit more but it's still really good.

Without the Kindle unlimited I feel like the Kindle books are a bit more expensive than they used to be before they had the service but all in all they have a vast library with great searchable filters including lgbt+ which I greatly appreciate. The store works well on my kindle but I prefer to browse it on my phone just to see the color in the covers.

All in all, if you are looking for a simple e-reader with a good selection of books and a browser for your online reading, I highly recommend this guy."
Tina,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Paperwhite. I had the Kindle Fire before but I really didn't need a tablet, I just wanted an eReader. The backlight was important to me which is why I went with the Paperwhite. It fits in my hand perfectly and it's easier to hold than a paperback book. I was a little concerned at first about where the on/off button is located because I was used to standing my Fire on the nightstand but I find with the Paperwhite I am more comfortable holding it so it hasn't been an issue. I haven't tried using it to read outside yet but my expectations are pretty low based on other reviews and that's not that big of deal to me."
P.A.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the new kindle paperwhite (2019) after accidentally damaging the light on the screen on my old paperwhite (2013). The updated device is nice, waterproof & lighter than its predecessor. But I *hate* all the ads on the startscreen & off-screen. Even even if you deactivate the ""suggested purchases"" startscreen, there is a ad banner on the bottom you can't get rid of. The old paperwhite had elegant designs on the screen when the device was turned off, now I have a permanent ad for some popular novel 24/7. See attached picture of old paperwhite (on the left) versus the new model. Very disappointed Amazon!"
Samantha Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I switched from an HD8 and I LOVE my paperwhite! The lock button on the bottom is a non-issue for me, even without a case yet. It’s as glare-free as anti glare gets (I had an anti glare screen protector on my 8 that didn’t do nearly as well. I think people are seriously nitpicking that aspect and taking photos at angles they wouldn’t read from just to find some glare. I’ve never seen a device so glare-free). My first two photos were taken outside in full sunlight with the brightness all the way down and all the way up. The reading experience is so much nicer than my HD 8 was. It’s much lighter weight and easier on your eyes because it has lights, but not true “backlighting” like other devices. The screen actually looks like ink on paper. Even in total darkness, I rarely turn my Kindle light above the first brightness setting (I only have to if my eyes aren’t adjusted to the dark yet!)

You can borrow library books online; just download Libby or Overdrive to your phone and set delivery to your Kindle. If you prefer to shop in color, you can do the same with the Kindle store. I do suggest buying this Kindle ad-free because as other photo reviews show, it isn’t just ads on the lock screen. There are banner ads in the store, and due to the smaller screen size, I imagine that would get on my nerves. If you can buy with a free Kindle Unlimited trial, do that too! I already have unlimited, and it’s the BEST! (It’s also half off for 3 months ($30) until the end of 2019 if you don’t already have it but already have your Kindle!)

I don’t have any dead pixels, but that can happen to any device. My 3DS has a couple dead pixels and I’m not giving that a one-star review over it... Don’t trust the negativity!"
Manda Phillips,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loving this! I have had other e-ink readers and non e-ink readers/tablets and this one is my favorite so far! It's the perfect size, feels good in my hand and while I have only owned it a week the battery has a 90% charge with every day use and WiFi on. Pretty good in my book.
I don't have a case for it yet as I heard some bad things about the Amazon ones but I'm not too afraid for it. It feels sturdy and well built and I even take it to work where I am working with dogs and it survives.

With my week of use so far it is a definite 5 star from me!"
Abayas,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There are several nice things about the kindle, sure. It has a nice screen for viewing in sunlight, is waterproof, great battery life when reading, relatively cheaper books, etc etc.

One 'feature' I am looking forward to trying is the ability to (sometimes) download books from your public library- something I had to learn about online. I might update once I've tried it.

Drawbacks I have noticed so far:
1. Probably due to the nature of being waterproof, no jack for earphones. This can be worked around with bluetooth.

2. Screen responsiveness is a little sluggish. Again, this is likely due to the nature of how the device works. By moving liquefied crystal around and letting it set saves your battery, but takes a bit of time.

3. Clunky navigation, but it's not too bad once you've got your books. You don't actually deal with the navigation a ton.

4. This one is a bit strange to me and the main point of my review. I would call it a major oversight or even a flaw. You can change the size of text- and this is great- but you cannot enlarge images. Reading a fantasy book with a map? Better bring a magnifying glass. Maybe a book with pictures? A comic? Good luck. I was investigating the possibility of using the kindle to read piano sheet music, practicing scales, but the measures would not scale at all. (I realize that it was a dumb idea- reading sheet music on something as small as a kindle is silly, but the point still stands.)

I still like the kindle- I just need more time to get used to its quirks."
charles dixon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't believe that after having it for 8 months it broke and the trade in is $5 for the $130 product.
It was used sparingly, less than 50 hours. Kept warm and safe inside, not abused in the least.
I think a 30 day guarantee on this type of product should be against the law."
C,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a second paperwhite I have purchased. The first one I had for almost 5 years. I would still be using it, had I been able to find customer service who helped me turn it back on. I had a problem with my first one and bought this second one, before I fixed it. I like the water resistant feature although I haven't tried it out yet. Have had an intermittent problem when it doesn't stay on while I'm reading. A bit irritating, but easily solved. I will be chiecking with customer service about it. Otherwise I love it."
Daisha,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had this for two weeks and it’s constantly drained and needing to charge.

UPDATE: I went through all the trouble shooting on this and tried every trick to get it to hold a charge, but it never worked as it should. The battery was so bad that Amazon ended up replacing the device for me. That would have been a satisfactory resolution and kept me happy as a customer, except the replacement they sent is REFURBISHED. It's their right to pull something like that per their warranty policy, but selling a bad product that doesn't work as promised and then fixing the problem by sending a refurbished replacement is terrible customer service. The outcome for me is that I've now paid full price for a refurbished device and Amazon's customer service response is basically, ""Oh well."" Just the smallest offer of a concession (a credit to my account, a waiver to unsubscribe from special offers, a ""we're sorry"" gift card...) would have kept me as an Amazon Prime customer instead of reminding me that I really don't want to be one."
P. Harlow,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I miss the color that was on my old Kindle Fire reader. Some book covers are not easy to view in black and white. I miss that I can't turn this e-reader into a horizontal position to read. I could leave the cover partially open and it would balance on any surface. I can't navigate around the book as well on this reader, but maybe it's because I haven't had it long enough.

I do like the fact that it is lightweight."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the new waterproof Kindle including special offers as a Christmas gift from my husband. I had been a long time NOOK user but really like the waterproof aspect of the Kindle as well as the non-glare screen for reading outside. Have been getting used to using it and am very happy. The only thing I don't know/haven't figured out, is whether or not there is a way to organize the books I download, i.e. setting up possible bookshelves. Also, is there a way to transfer my old NOOK library over to the kindle? Overall, the new Kindle Paperwhite was a 'win' as far as a Christmas gift! Would recommend."
Audrey48,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using the app in my tablet for years, lately that meant charging it everyday due to how much reading I am doing. I decided to purchase the Kindle Paperwhite because I wouldn't have to charge it as often. I have had to charge the paperwhite about once a week since I bought it and I appreciate that. I read at night mostly, thanks to insomnia, and it is perfect for that. I can control the brightness.
It is lightweight and a nice size for carrying around with me if I choose too."
courtney,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrible for reading PDFs, worse than the hard button version. When you use inverse lighting, it flashes back every time you turn the page like a potential seizure trigger. Even on lowest brightness setting, the backlight never turns off - this means awful battery life. My last Kindle would lasts weeks. Even on airplane mode, lowest brightness setting, this thing lasts a couple of days. Good thing I kept the old Kindle. The touch screen response is so slow, they should return to hard buttons. Also harder to organize and view than old Kindle. This was a sad buy. Hold off for a much revamped version."
J. A. Shuster,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using Kindle products for years now and I just love this new waterproof version with a nice smooth screen. My favorite version of Kindle has been the Paperwhite because I really love that there isn't any glare in sunlight and I can use it in any kind of lighting situation without eye strain and it is the closest to reading an actual book. My 13 year old son also uses Kindle and I have to say that he reads a lot more because he has it (he has the previous generation which I also love). You really can't go wrong with Kindle and I'm super excited about this new waterproof version and love how slim it is.
LOnerom,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Only had it a week and I'm replacing my first kindle which I loved, but am a little disappointed in this newer one. Doesn't hold the change in font size or bolder font. I'm 75 need larger font. Doesn't seem lighter in weight either."
Sue H,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I moved up from a Generation 5 Kindle to the newest Gen 10 so there are some differences in navigating my library that I am still learning. I do love the back-lighting so I can read in bed without any light on. I already have 212 books and I believe this Kindle has more storage space than my old one. Although I still read paper books a lot, I love having so many books at my disposal, especially when traveling."
"Claxon,Bill",5.0 out of 5 stars,"an excellent upgrade with something for everyone.More storage,audio capability thru bluetooth headphones , slighty improved screen contrast, waterproof, smaller ,thinner and easier to hold with one hand ; battery retention up to one week or more and a flat screen with easy swiping page turns and five lights( from four) to brighten even more of the screen for reading.There are many other internal and technical reading improvement additions that I have not mentioned( or used) and to understand in time.Upgrade?If only for that fifth light and flat screen that make the contrast just a notch better than the PW3."
Peter,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have you had the experience of buying a new one after your 10 year old car could no longer be repaired? The improvements and function are too numerous to list ..... and the same for this Kindle. Everything about my new Kindle Paperwhite (gen 10) is better than the Kindle (gen 4) which was finally done after many years (seized up and no trick would bring it back). The operation of the Paperwhite touch screen, the features for customizing the reading experience, and especially the built-in and adjustable lighting are all superb! Don't forget to add a cover for protection .... the magnetic flap catch is a nice touch that adds to the clean design and convenience. No regrets on this purchase, and everything is good."
ETPopp,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the fact that the Kindle goes to sleep when closed, and, when opened, it is a simple matter to wake it up.
The sides of the newest Kindle Paper White are very sensitive, and, if distracted or nod off a bit, you could move ahead or behind by several pages, if your finger hits a bit too far onto the screen. Not the best idea.
Also, the Kindle is a tad smaller than my older generation, so, the case for my older kindle is larger and the newest Kindle does not fit as tightly, which will mean spending more money for a new case. Perhaps that is why the new Kindle is a bit smaller????
The newest features are advanced, and, when I have figured them all out, would make it a great advancement.
All in all, I am very pleased w/ the newest Kindle Paper White."
MW,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect. Size is excellent for travel, type is crisp and clear, and in document font size adjustment a great feature. Plus, reading on my phone using the Kindle app was draining my phone battery. I have only charged this kindle once since I got it, and I read from it almost every day.
Also, the leather cover Is a great addituon, front snaps back and held in place for one hand reading. And it adds almost no bulk.

Ordered a second one today as a gift."
David B,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The page advance, if not a sharp single straight hit TAP, will result in a random set of pages advanced. (forward and sometimes backward).
Then it is difficult to determine which way it ""advanced"" and how many pages, so finding where you were is hard, time consuming, and frustrating.
Reported, but Amazon has no SETTING, nor offered and software bug fix, to fix the problem and document the multipage advance as either a feature or a bug OR it is a screen problem, but again, no setting to adjust sensitivity."
Mark Calvin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been using a kindle tablet to read, but I but I realized that it was hard on my eyes-especially at night. Got this e-reader for my birthday. Now I can read in bright sunlight, by the pool or in my jacuzzi tub without eye fatigue. Best of all it is water proof!!!
I wish that it had an auto rotate screen and I don't like that the on/off is on the bottom right. When I'm holding the device I have accidentally turned it off on more than one occasion."
gtjohn,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the leather case with it. However, this device is not very easily held - at least the case should have some sort of pocket or handle to it so you could slip a finger in it. My Nook is a little bulkier and sometimes it will turn multiple pages but at least I can hold it easier with the case it has. With the Kindle, I end up activating page turns, going back to home, etc just trying to hold on to it. Not real happy with it now but maybe I can get used to it. Maybe try another case but this one was pretty expensive."
Lori,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always thought I preferred to read from a book, but this is so nice and compact. No more lugging huge books around. I love being able to change the font size. Being able to look up a word quickly and easily is also a plus. The only negative so far is sometimes when I try to go back or forward it will skip several pages. Doesn’t happen often but can be a little irritating."
mbrkelley,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this to replace my Paperwhite from a few years ago. This was very easy to set up. However, I noticed that the pages had a yellowish tinge to them, unlike my current Paperwhite, which is very white. I worked with Amazon customer service, but nothing we tried improved the quality of the pages. Amazon even sent a replacement, but the same thing happened. Very disappointed . . . ended up returning the replacement, too. Decided I'd just keep what I have until it stops working."
Christine H.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this for only 6 days and it's already needed charging so the ""weeks of battery life"" seems false. I hope this can be addressed with software updates, as for now I have turned off bluetooth in hopes that will help extend the battery life. So far the battery life is noticeably worse than my 7th generation Kindle I traded in for this.

Otherwise I like the smooth front of the screen and border a lot. Customized page settings is a nice feature. Otherwise it's largely the same as my previous Kindle as far as usability."
BritePenny,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Kindle reader replaces the stack of books that I would normally order every month. It makes reading in bed convenient. It is supposed to have a long reading time without recharging. It seems that I have to recharge often. Perhaps I am reading more time in a day than most people. It is easy to order new books, especially those in a series where you simply click on the icon of the next book in the series. In all, I am very happy with my investment."
panterazero,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My Kindle is something I use every day and would not live without. I appreciate having 8 gig of memory rather than the one gig of my old one. But the new one has to be booted up with the power switch every time I use it, instead of just being awake when I open the case. It's an annoyance.

Update: I noticed that the battery life of my new 10th gen was significantly worse than my old 7th gen and thought it was a problem specific to my unit. It's not, the charge duration of the 10th gen is universally rated as poor, or at least as worse than the 7th gen. I need to switch back."
Concept User,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Right after one year of pucahsing (Dec 2018), the unit died: battery icon with exclamation sign. Unit is not chariging (ligh didn't turn on even after overnight charging). Reset button doesn't work.

Probaby doesn't make sense to have it repaired, as the new one cost only $85. I saw people replacing battery and usb connector themselves?

We have two paperwhite units used by the kids, those are almost 4 year old, and with no problem. Is this just an immature product or what? Very disappointed."
Louis Sherwood,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the Kindle Paperwhite. It's very easy on the eyes and can be read in bright sunlight. I like being able to close my Paperwhite with a compatible cover and have it go to sleep, then wake up, automatically, when I open the cover. It's much lighter than carrying around a book and stores easily in my vest pocket. I'm impressed with the fact than I can, now, read audio books with my Kindle Paperwhite, using a Bluetooth device. I, thoroughly, enjoy my Kindle Paperwhite and recommend it to everyone."
juniebtonedeaf,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle ever. I’ve been reading books since I was 5 or 6. I’m 21 now. I was always skeptical of kindles but I have an upcoming trip where I’ll kind of be in need of books to entertain myself and I can’t lug all of them along. I didn’t know what to expect of a kindle, maybe something similar to an iPad but simpler. Sometimes it feels like the screen lags in its movement—particularly when scrolling—I feel like I’m using an early 2000s computer when it comes to using the store but when it comes down to reading it’s great. I lost my love for reading but not for book collecting (seeing that I still buy books whenever I can) and I’ve read more on the kindle than I have in the past few months alone."
David M. Corbin,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the new one to replace an original paperwhite that I had had since they came out.
I thought that the extra battery life would be good.
Not so !
Had problems almost from the beginning.
Even though I had turned off the kindle, the battery drained almost all the way down between uses.
I had to buy a micro USB charging cord for $10 when I was on the road just so I could read my books.
NOT HAPPY.
I called and a Amazon tech helped me reset it and it has been working fine.
My advice ?
Keep your old one until it dies - I see NO advantage with the new model."
trampslillady,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved my original 2013 Paperwhite. Still worked great. Would not have really considered replacing it if I hadn't run out of storage - I was constantly having to remove books from my old model to be able to add new ones due to lack of storage. So, ofcourse, I upgraded to 32gb. I've had this new one for about 3 weeks now. I've only had to charge it once! And I read CONSTANTLY - average about a book a day. So, I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about as far battery life complaints? Baffled by that. We have a pool, so the added bonus of waterproofing is great too"
cknouf,5.0 out of 5 stars,"like that this one is water resistant one suggestion get the magnetic charger and leave the plug in my last kindle I had to replace as the charging hole stretched from plugging and unplugging it over the years, nothing else wrong with it. Wish they came with a sealed magnetic charging spot built in."
Kaye S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The reviews alone are what got me sold. I took the giant leap and bought myself my first ever e-reader. I used my saved up money and I’m a teenager so that’s a huge decision for me. I bought the 32gb, even though I know I could trade it in for new releases, but on the off chance that I didn’t like the new release, then I could just keep using this Kindle knowing that I won’t have to worry about the device’s storage limits. I can just keep on using this Kindle while waiting for a new release that I would like to trade in with. I did get the “with special offers” though they don’t seem disruptive. They only appear on the lock screen which you can just ignore and save some money and when in the future you get annoyed with it, I’ve read that you can just pay to get it removed. NO REGRETS whatsoever. For anyone looking to buy their first ever e-reader or looking for an upgrade, look no further because the All New Kindle Paperwhite 2018 is for you! Buy it! You will not regret it! I AM SO IN LOVE WITH IT! And you will be too!
(First picture: lowest brightness setting. Looking pretty clear)
(Second picture: highest brightness setting. Still looking pretty clear)
(Third picture: inverted screen with no brightness. Looking good.)
The case: Amazon water-safe fabric cover in Blue

UPDATE: It’s been more than a week, approx. 8 days, since I first bought the Kindle Paperwhite 2018. I HAVE NOT yet charged this and it is still just on 40% after more than a week! With the Wi-Fi on the whole time and with the brightness being changed up and down. When reading before or in bed, I turn the brightness all the way down and invert it to the black screen and white text and it looks clear for me without the harsh light disrupting my circadian rhythm. That’s a win for me. I usually end up having to charge my other devices after just 2 days of full use but this one is a winner for me!
So glad I bought this one instead of the Oasis, which is a lot more expensive. This does everything the Oasis does plus it fits right into your bag and it’s super lightweight. The Paperwhite has a page orientation of landscape and portrait view which all anybody really needs. I’ve heard that the Oasis has a sensor page orientation that rotates the screen and no rotation lock which is a plus point towards the Paperwhite.
GO BUY THE ALL NEW KINDLE PAPERWHITE WATERPROOF 2018! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"
Johnny J,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good. First e-reader, and I heard for the most part it it’s your first e-reader you won’t have any complaints( compared to the previous generation) does what it supposed to, clear lighted up screen, good battery, easy to read. The only thing I can say about either generation is that the special offers don’t bother at all, it’s not like they’ll pop up or get in the way, they’re just there when your screen is locked, then you swipe to unlock screen and they’re gone. So if you wanna sabe yourself a couple dollars get it with special offers, if it really bothers you then you can pay and take them off later."
RM98104,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased to read periodicals. I wanted to reduce deforestation and find an easier way to read: WSJ, NYT, WA Post, Seattle Times, Economist, NY Daily News, and Bloomberg Business News. Perfect!

Holds charge for several days, lightweight, easy on the eyes, much more economical since you’re not paying for physical delivery.
The only downside is the difficulty saving/sharing articles outside of the Kindle device. Have not invested too much time is researching how to export the “clipped” article file, but this is a small downside."
Stephanie,2.0 out of 5 stars,"For a 13 year old product, Kindle has barely advanced. I’d broken my old one (kindle 2 from ~2010) several years ago and never gotten a new one (used iPad instead) so it’s been a while since I used an actual Kindle. I bought this because the backlighting was starting to annoy me the more I read and I kept reading about how blue light at night is bad for your eyes and for falling asleep.

The weight of the Kindle is light, and the paper white is much nicer on the eyes, but that’s about all I can say that’s nice. The touchscreen often lags. The Library screen has become super confusing jumble instead of a straight up lists of my titles since most of the screen is taken up with book recommendations Amazon is trying to get me to buy. To do simple tasks requires multiple clicks. When highlighting for example, you have to click several times - first to select the text, then to choose what you want to do with that text, then dragging the highlight to end in the right place. Getting your highlight to capture the right lines is itself an art form, particularly if you go onto another page. Why can’t the kindle just have highlighting mode so I don’t have to belabor each highlight? Taking notes is excruciating because of the keyboard lag; the export highlights function is marginally more helpful if you can tolerate how annoying it is to highlight anything. The battery life is fine but it’s not as good as my old Kindle, which wouldn’t die for weeks. This Kindle will die, after fully charged, without being used, which means Amazon is running some kind of background software on it while it’s at rest. Overall I am not impressed."
Brenda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it all! the built in light is awesome, my original kindle did not have the light and this is a HUGE improvement !
The touch screen works perfectly and I am amazed at the battery life.
I also love that it is so thin and light weight, I purchased a cute cover for it and I love that I can stick the kindle in my purse and take it out anytime, anywhere. My favorite Christmas present this year"
Big T,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by saying I purchased this paper white back in Nov of '18. I have used it on a limited basis in the 1 1/2 years that I have had the device. I could guarantee it hasn't been 50 times. Anyway, after putting it down for roughly a couple months, I was set to take the paper white on a trip that I would be doing extensive reading. I charged it overnight, and I keep getting an icon in the middle of the screen of a battery with an exclamation point inside the battery.

I have gone up on youtube to try every different remedy suggested to fix the problem. 1. keep holding the button for 40 seconds. (Done multiple times) 2. Charge overnight (I let it stay on with multiple chords on numerous nights). I interacted with Amazon customer care, and they stated that they could give me a discount of 15% towards buying another paperwhite. Or, I could get a whopping ""20% off"" if I gave up the Kindle.

I did like the product when it actually worked. My problem is this is an Amazon product and their remedy for a faulty product is excessively punitive. It's out of warranty. I get it. I paid $159.00 for this ""paperweight"", and now I am being told that I have the privilege of getting $23 towards the purchase of another one of these. I'll bet anyone on here that they won't sell it for that much. Just sayin.

I have been a huge Amazon supporter through my Prime Membership, and it leaves such a bad taste that they won't handle their own product deficiency. If they said, ""We will swap out for a refurbished unit"", I would understand and be happy. Instead, I have an Amazon brick to look at on my shelf. Buyer beware!"
Linda Dunne,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a Paper White kindle with 0700 on the back that seemed to be getting a little slow so I ordered this model.
I find the the battery life is about 1/2 to 1/3 of my original model and ordering books from the store in the Kindle is very annoying. I have to search out 1/2 the purchases on my computer and have them resent. Also, one day all but six of my my purchases simply disappeared from my screen overnight. I had to go back and reload them. I like the screen but the rest of the Kindle has been an infernal nuisance!"
Diana Book Choices,3.0 out of 5 stars,Have problem with the connector that came with it to recharge and ordered a new one because it was suppose to be free but never received the new one. Now there is a charge for it. Don't like that I can't get through a whole book without recharging the kindle. Wish it had the option to plug it in like my old one because difficult connecting to external speakers and can't get it to work in my car blue tooth. I keep working with it but it has been slow process getting use to it. Like that I can see pages much better than older model I had. Disappointed is this kindle but some it may just be me.
Beni B,4.0 out of 5 stars,"i have only 2 issues: 1st im not fond of the plain black and white seemingly exo-sketch style format (yet i understand it helps with battery life) 2nd i'm not fond of the fact i can't plug in headphones, i shouldn't be forced into buying bluetooth when i have 100+ $ turtle bay headset and an adaptor being wasted. i love audio books but haven't listened to many sense i got this and had i realized this i may not have bought it, however the device in its reading function is perfect i sit and read for hours now and its crazy relaxing and waterproof as well :)"
dreaming_days_away,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to buy the Kindle because I had been reading on the Kindle app on my Amazon Fire, but the glare was bothering me. I am so happy I decided to go ahead and buy this (and on Prime Day with the great deal!) There are some frustrating glitchy things that I feel technology should have fixed by now - the screen sort of resets every time you move to a new screen, and the response time from screen to screen is pretty slow and sluggish. But honestly those are such minor issues in the grand scheme of things, I can't even fault the rating and my overall enjoyment of this product. I read SO many books, and I'm happy with this."
Brian T,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I debated back and forth for a while about buying this kindle. I've never used an Ereader before and wasnt sure how I'd feel about reading from a screen versus reading an actual book. Well let me tell you I absolutely love it! I've had it for about a month and the battery is still on its first charge. It honestly feels like I'm staring at the pages of a book. The best part is that I'm starting on my third novel and didn't have to leave the couch or wait for it to show up in the mail. Thousands of books at the touch of a finger! I definitely recommend this kindle. It's small, lightweight and has a great, practical design."
Mimi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Paperwhite to replace the Fire HD 8, which was too big for me to hold easily and has a battery life that I found too inconvenient for reading purposes (it took too long to charge and the battery drained quickly even on airplane mode). So far I like the Paperwhite in regards to weight and usability. I'm still used to using a tablet so I had expected the speed to be quite fast but that is not the case. The photos attached compare the new Paperwhite to the Fire HD 8. I will provide an update once I use it for a few months."
Empress of Prose,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The kindle is not as easy to use as my Nook glowlight. The light is harder to adjust, and the print has fewer options. I have still got to figure out how to find a bookmarked page if I am on another page. The pages do not turn consistently. I may simply want to go forward one page, but it may take me ahead five. All in all, it's disappointing. The kindle app works much better, though the bookmarks are still funky. But if I want to read myself to sleep, a bright, colorful device is a poor option."
R. P. Grigsby,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the size. Fits in my pocket so I always have it. Much easier to read than my original Kindle. I haven't found anything to not like except the battery appears to not be good for 25 hours as advertised. I spent a few hours reading starting at 100% and power had dropped to 51%. Could be because of my WiFi connection so I will check that out.

The combination of this Kindle with bargain Kindle books is deadly. Too easy to hit the ""Buy with One Click"" button. But I've found some really awesome books for cheap. Much more practical than my first generation Kindle."
Cedar Dell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really love my new kindle reader. Just love that it weighs like nothing, although the leather cover does add some weight. This is my fourth kindle, which I will use for just reading all my books. Love that it is somewhat waterproof. Will take along for sure on my cruise vacations ( beaches and pools). Live very close to Lake Michigan and will enjoy reading on pier in summertime. Just wish that it was available with more space (64 not just 32). Would definitely recommend to purchase. I love all of my kindles.

Ery"
Register Me,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We had such high hopes for the kindle having been avid iPad readers seeking a light weight easy-on-the-eye device, which the kindle promised both of. Unfortunately, these came at the cost of a blinking screen that flashes to black with every touch. The experience is so jarring and unacceptable we were astonished a company could release such rubbish to the public in 2020. If we were not traveling for the rest of the year this device would have been returned the next day.

Advice to you if you’re, considering purchasing, abort!"
Dianne Stronach,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this kindle as a replacement for my older kindle that had both the ability to connect through wi-fi and cell. The description said that this model had both of these capabilities. After receiving the product, I could not see any cellular connection and connected product support. After researching the model, they told me indeed that I should have had both accesses. They tried software upgrades and then declared that the product was flawed and that they would be sending me a replacement. The replacement arrived and still did not have the cellular capability. Again I tried product support and again they told me it should have both wi-fi and cell and could not understand why it would not work. They recommended that I try the software upgrade and then they would have this go to technical support if it still did not work. After the software upgrade did not work, I contacted product support for a third time. This individual told me that the model did not have cellular capability despite the product description on Amazon. He offered me a $25 credit for the hours that I spent with product support, but I never saw any credit. I was told that I would have to spend an additional $150 to get the cellular service. I still don't know what to do. I am very dependent on my kindle and it appears that the own that I have, that I love, is not repairable nor replaceable. I am in a difficult position because I can not switch to another vendor since I have an enormous catalog of digital assets that I have paid for through amazon. Amazon Cloud is not convenient to use. What a terrible mess!"
Bilgewater,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th Kindle (my wife is on her #3). Being without my Kindle would be hard as I love to read and paperbacks and hardcovers take up a lot of space, and the weight adds up, especially when traveling. My Kindle, which doesn’t weigh as much as most paperbacks, has over a hundred titles on hand awaiting their turn, and all within a footprint I could slip into a pocket. And the backlighted screen is great...no external light (not always available) necessary that might also serve as an irritant to others who might be attempting to sleep."
Old Fashioned Values,5.0 out of 5 stars,"SIMPLY LOVE my new Kindle Paperwhite 2018 e-reader! It came to me pre-registered to my account and my library was already there when I powered it up! I have had all the Kindle e-readers, including the more expensive Voyage and Oasis. The Paperwhite is my all time favorite and I have found it to be the easiest to use. I am especially happy with the double storage capacity upgrade! HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting this one!"
Margaret Bonds,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I read. My old Kindle broke so I ordered another. I read A LOT. When it came, I was disappointed to see that the books from the broken Kindle were not there. I thought that it was an oversight and called your customer service, It was as if I had requested the Holy Grail. Finally somebody told me that I needed to get Household. Why in the world fid you not send me step by step directions? Why didn't you all tell me that my bought and paid for books, not to mention my 10 kindle unlimited ones} were gone forever. Amazon used to be a consumer friendly company. Did you get so big that your customers don't matter? Margaret Bonds"
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am coming from a Kindle DX, so I thought this would be too small to read from, I was wrong. It may be small but it is really nice to read my books. It is also very easy to just pop into my pocket and take it along to read when I am waiting at appointments. I lucked out when I purchased it during the holidays and really saved money with a trade in and upgrade, along with the reduced price of a bundle. I LOVE IT!!!"
G. Love,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I got this and booted it up and began to use it I was very disappointed in it. It was very slow and appeared to freeze a lot. I learned that by restarting it, it ran a lot faster. This is because if you download books and try to read at the same time, it just does not have the muscles needed to multitask. Once I learned that I started doing one task at a time and it was much more satisfying experience. This is not a tablet!!!! But it is a very nice book reader. I love the size and battery life. Go for the 32 G with no ads."
Tanner nelson,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So I do think theres some real value in this device, especially at the price point, but there are some issues that have left me feeling pretty sour.

Pros:
-long lasting batterylife
-affordable
-lightweight and small... I.e. its easy to transport
-the screen is nonreflective

Cons:
-Advertises to you when imactive. whenever the device is shut down or has just been powered up it is advertising to you, for me I only see books being advertised but still, the fact I cannot customize the lock screen and that the content on it is advertisments really makes it feel as though it isnt MY personal device.
-the settings are pitiful. There just are hardly any settings or forms of UI custimization which sucks. You cant change how long before it auto locks on you (which is awful for me as i use math and chem textbooks which contain problems on it and it takes a few seconds to reboot the page each time it auto locks)
-this is minor as its an expected trade off at the price point but the processor is slow, zooming and turning pages is slow and feels displeasing."
B. Lawyer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I feel like I fell for Amazon's marketing machine that makes you think their devices are the greatest since sliced bread. With all the advertising I'm subjected to daily for Amazon's products, I thought I just had to have this stand-alone Kindle for the reading experience. After years of already being accustomed to eReading on my iPad Air via the Kindle App, I was immediately dissapointed when I first laid hands on the cheap kindle. It looks, feels, and operates like a device that should be sold at a $49 price point (thankfully I bought on Prime day for $85). Amazon went probably an inch too small on the screen. I think one added inch on the screen might make a difference. Navigation was clunky like using an IBM computer with floppy disk in the 80s compared to what I was accustomed to on my iPad Air. I thought maybe I just need to give it time, but I've given it a few weeks now and wish I would have just saved my money to put $100 toward my next tablet rather than this stand-alone eReader POS."
Terri L.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for reading, lightweight, comfortable for an elderly lady to hold vs. the thick paperbacks or ""heavy"" hard cover books. The improvements could include a scroll feature instead of waiting until you finish the screen to swipe or tap to turn the page, and also it's finicky about getting to the menu and library. If I could arrange the home page to just include her library items, it would be easier for her to find her own books to start reading, but the suggested reading makes it confusing to her when the library is a smaller icon to hit to get to. Other than those things, win! The battery doesn't seem to last a week as indicated, but she does read a lot."
Carroll Schoenhals,5.0 out of 5 stars,My only problem is that it will not transfer a Sokuko game from my older kindle because of updates in the kindle. Otherwise the features of the Kindle are amazing and I appreciate the light and ease of the touchscreen. I find some real good things done on the 4th paperwhite Kindle from the 2nd paperwhite Kindle.
AZ212,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own a Kindle Oasis, which I absolutely love. I purchased the paperwhite as backup, but to my surprise I sometimes find myself using it more often than the Oasis. It is light, beautiful and most importantly clear. I love the color of the screen as well as the back lighting. Highly recommended and it is absolutely an excellent device."
STS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Originally I used one of the 2nd generation kindles. It was good for reading in bright light and had a great battery life. But, nighttime reading was akward using a book light to illuminate the display. Then I switched to using the kindle app on my iPad which was ok, but there are the normal distractions like notices from various apps and mail. I decided to give the Paperwhite a try and I really like it. Lightweight, excellent battery life (over two weeks with nightly reading), great backlight for both day and nighttime reading, and no distractions. Highly recommended."
Victorina W,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So I traded in my previous gen paperwhite to get this new one for only $65! Well it was terrible! The battery life dropped from 100 to 18 overnight on airplane mode! So I contacted Amazon and got a replacement. The replacement came Thursday, this is Saturday. I read for a bit last night, it was at 98%; I turned it off, still in airplane mode, this morning it was at 17% :(

I'm returning it to buy the same paperwhite I had. I am so sorry I bought this one. I've never had such a subpar product from Amazon. Very disappointing!!!!!"
DebT,3.0 out of 5 stars,"it’s small, lighter & easy to carry but the switch to turn this off is in an awkward spot so accidentally easy to shut off. Also mine has not synced all my books from my kindle account & can’t figure out why?
Battery life is good but if you’re like me & sometimes read for hours at a time especially on vacation it does not last for weeks just a few days. It is much better on that than my previous kindle however. Do not like that you can’t charge this by a wall charger though ."
Kara Richter,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle so this review comes from someone with a fresh opinion unbiased by comparison to previous versions. I love this thing. It’s quite customizable - brightness, font, spacing, measures of progress in the book.. a lot more than I was expecting for the price. I really enjoy the dictionary feature where you can simply press on a word and get an immediate definition. It’s a bit slow when highlighting a section or changing screens but nothing that takes away from my reading experience. The battery life is PHENOMENAL. Also, unpopular opinion but I actually kind of like the ads on the sleep screen. They’re all book recommendations and I’ve actually seen a couple titles that interest me. I got the kindle to save money and space on my book shelves and it has done just that. My only negative is the location of the power button is right where my thumb likes to rest when I’m holding it, so every now and then I accidentally turn it off. Not a huge deal, but it would have been much more practical to have the button on top in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this kindle for someone who is just interested in the reading and not all the bells and whistles of the pricier versions."
ArtR,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything I expected. The reader is really easy to use ... and read. Very well lighted, fairly easy to navigate and the battery lasts a really long time. I'm upgrading from an original Kindle so the home page is a bit busy, but the touch screen makes it really easy to get around. Only complaint ... and this isn't the product's but Amazon's problem, they need to be more specific with magazine/newspaper offerings. I like to read magazines on the reader ... just text, no pictures ... but if you scroll through the offerings it's hard to tell which ones are 'Paperwhite' or 'Fire'. Otherwise, very satisified."
Joe I Palmateer II,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my kindle readers I am on my third now and each was a little better than the last. Don't plan to read in the shower, but being water resistant can't hurt. My only issue with my new kindle is that there is almost no way to hold it comfortably without flipping a page from time to time, and some times don't know which way it flipped. Even getting too close to the screen will flip a page, a button on the bottom turns it off, and little more than a half inch border to hold on to without flipping. Always was a bit of an issue, but this one is even more so."
KLG,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th Kindle. For some reason books are completely deleted and not just removed. To find books, I can’t just look on my Kindle. I have to go to my Amazon account to find them because they don’t appear in my library. I can’t add to collections. I keep getting an error message that says it’s because I’m adding the book from a computer even though I buy and add right from my Kindle. Really frustrating.

The battery life is not as good as in the past either."
Charles Peterson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the main reason I purchased this was due to the down fall in quality of the Nook. Now that I have purchased the Kindle I am upset that it took me this long. I have had many versions of the other brand but they only got worse. The last one the battery lasted tops two days and the customer support was deflection at best. Now that I have the Kindle and kindle unlimited I am truly happy. I read extensively and the combo of those two have been wonderful. I have been an Amazon Prime member for years and now I know I waisted money at the other place when I could have had it all right here. Convenience, great customer support, selection of reading, and all around quality. I am glad that I made the switch, truly."
Madelyn Sprunk,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this kindle. Before I got the paperwhite I was using one of the older kindles with a book light (I do most of my reading before bed). Needless to say, it was heavy and bulky and I was using a ton of batteries for the light. The backlight on this kindle is my favorite feature. It has adjustable brightness. You can also invert the black and white to make reading in the dark easier. I like the touchscreen but I wish you could turn to the next page by tapping on either side of the screen, not just tapping on the right side. Battery life is surprisingly good considering it has the backlight. Overall, I like this much better than my older kindle and I would recommend this."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read a lot. I used to say that my favorite sound was of the book hitting the floor when I fall asleep reading. Now, I try not to drop this kindle, but I still fall asleep while reading. I take this on my long commute every day. It is light to carry, the battery never dies. It holds enough books that I can switch between 3 books, depending on my attention level. I like that it starts up very quickly and the touch screen is responsive."
Tiffany M Marquart,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been a Nook user for ten years and just switched to Kindle. I do like the Kindle, however, I think it has some usability issues. Nook had a nice 3/4” frame around the screen which made it comfortable to hold. Kindle only has like a 1/2” frame which makes it difficult to hold while reading without flipping pages at the same time. Also, I’m still getting used to the home screen. The pixels are great for reading the books, but the pictures in the store and library screens aren’t great for online shopping experience. But maybe most people buy new books and shop while on laptop or other devices."
JEN,5.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t read much books but tend to listen to audible mostly. I read often from my iphone but perhaps not as good for my eyes. This is my attempt at reading and I only bought one book thus far. I find reading and listening beneficial. I got the kindle with ads and the ads only appear on the initial screen while the kindle is on idle mode. It doesn’t disrupt my reading. The navigation is still getting some used to. I would like it to automatically sync to the parts of the audible when I purchase both the book and audible. I get discount when I buy the book first and then the audible. I wonder if this is true for all audible/books.
AKGirl,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a wonderful e-reader. However, it is only in black and white text. I should have read the description more closely and ordered a new Kindle Fire. I'm an artist and many of the books are resource texts which means color theory, composition, and fine art books....in color. So, this wasn't a failure on the part of the Paperwhite. It was a failure on the part of the person purchasing it....that be me. If you're after an e-reader that has ease of use, great font sizes, long battery life and tons of storage, this is your pick."
Dane,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Device worked alright for the first few weeks. Extremely awkward to navigate, and while I understand this isn't a high end tablet with cutting edge specs the speed and fluid use of the device is a joke. Even simple things like text entry, ""turning a page"" and loading things like the home screen or library are very very slow to the point that I often have to click the screen multiple times to get the entry to actually work. That aside I continued using the device as I got in on sale and it's a basic device until one day I went to turn it on and my library had magically vanished from the device, a few gb of library between kindle books and audible books that were downloaded that just poof disappeared for no apparent reason. Spent 30 mins on chat support with zero help and over an hour of support time on the phone with no results, rep was friendly and helpful but appeared to have no actual technical or troubleshooting knowledge as I repeated the same steps over and over again until I finally told them that they needed to replace or return/refund the device. I have a replacement device on the way and will update or provide a new review if the second device is any better after some use time."
"""aimee_myers""",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the product. It is lightweight and ultra-clear, easy on the eyes.
I am currently reading a number of periodicals and enjoy having a couple of reference books on it as well.
I ordered it without the advertisements as I hate these, but still had to find a menu item to turn off suggestions in my library.
I have also begun to use highlighting and the note feature, which is not bad. The only thing I could wish for further would be the voice-to-text for the notes.
Books are easy to buy both from the unit and from Amazon.
I am not sure that I would need or utilize the waterproof feature.
The corners and the edges are rubberized, which would seem to help with banks bumps or drops. I chose a sleeve cover, as I didn't want the awkwardness and extra weight of a book type cover.
Overall very pleased and recommending to others."
Dwilli,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my 10th Kindle. Yes, I bought the very first one. I received my latest one a few days ago and it was defective. It would go to the dictionary randomly at least once a minute. Customer service kept giving my assignments to complete and test the reader again. When a test failed I was to try again and again. For example, they asked me read a different book. Same problem. So I was asked to try a third book. It was clearly not the book! Amazon refused to exchange my book unless I completely their endless tests. So I just returned it and ordered a new one. Wow! they raised the price 30%. Old unhappy customer."
Dan Miller,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love it.

I had been on the fence about buying a Kindle for a while. It just didn't make sense. I rarely had time to read. I have a small collection of physical books collecting dust. I've even had the Kindle app on my phone for ages but only used it occasionally. But one day it hit me: it's not that I didn't have time to read, it's that the times I do have to read make physical books a burden, and my phone too much of a distraction. So I broke down and bought a device with the single purpose of reading, and to my surprise, found myself reading more than I had in perhaps a decade.

The screen is a bit easier on the eyes than a phone screen, which is great for folks like me who like to read before bed. It also displays clearly out in the sun, if you're more inclined to read during the day.

The battery is fantastic – with a catch. With airplane mode on, I get weeks on a single charge. I took my Kindle with me on two week trip without needing to charge it. However, if I forget to switch off the network connection, it eats through the charge pretty quickly, lasting maybe a few days worth of reading. Which is still fairly impressive, to be fair.

Overall, I'm quite pleased with the Paperwhite, and highly recommend it to anyone else who may be on the fence like I was."
Pati Mooring,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was using my kindle fire for reading and though I love it because it has the ability to turn the background black, I really like the ability to read during the day light with out having to turn the screen up to bright white. It just auto shifts into to back lit and not. It's really great. I have only fully charged it once since I got it at Christmas. It maintains a charge for days on end. I would have to charge my fire daily. I can't wait for pool weather to read in the pool."
Dianne,5.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't really want a Kindle because I liked the feel of a book in my hands. My husband has been a Kindle user since they hit the market. He bought me one for Christmas & I reluctantly followed the tutorial (although very intuitive to figure out) and downloaded books and a magazine subscription. Took the Kindle on a cruise and loved it!! It fits in my purse and I could read multiple books during the cruise without them taking up suitcase space. Could also read easily in low light conditions and adjust the font so I didn't have to wear reading glasses. I don't have a single negative thing to say!
Michelle Eriksen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When you read as much as I do and have a very busy life this is the perfect reader for me. It doesn't allow notification or offer the added distraction of other apps, it had great battery life and it's easy to throw in my purse and take with me. The light lets me adjust the brightness so that I'm not disturbing the husband when I read at weird hours of the night or hurting my eyes. This is my second Paperwhite, I upgraded for the waterproof feature and my old one was handed down to my daughter so she can enjoy it, I highly recommend this product."
Gary Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always been a reader and I never thought that I would like a kindle. I like to hold the book and turn the pages but, I
Thought I would give it a try. I have to say, I really like my paperwhite. It's lightweight and size is great. It fits in my pocket and I take it everywhere. Thank you Amazon."
patti l. myner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m not sure about the battery life yet but this is my 7th Kindle & by far the best!! I just “dropped” it into water & no bubbles under the screen or anything. That is marvelous! I am trying to find out about ocean water though. I so hope I can take it out, close to shore of course or it will sink, but I really love this one. I started with the 1st one that came out many years ago, cost $399, but my granddaughter is still using it! Wonderful price for this & wonderful product!"
Corina57,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is my third kindle and I love the lower weight and the water-resistant feature . However I traded my last one in because the battery wasn’t holding a charge as long only to see that the new one’s battery drains even faster . Not sure I would have bothered to upgrade if I had known that in advance
JMP,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a kindle fire and had an old paper white. The battery life is awful on the fire and it's impossible to read if i'm outside.

I decided to upgrade since this is water proof. It's nice being able to read in the hottub with out using the bulky plastic cover and being able to read it on my deck or on the beach. Battery life is great. I use this a lot and only have to charge it every six weeks or so (and it's usually still at 20% when I recharge it).

The trade in offer of my old Kindle made this a great deal along with the six months of the prime library."
R. Smelcer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The 2018 Kindle paperwhite 32 GB, now waterproof, is so light you almost can't tell that it's in your hands. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. Even though I have a cover on it, I'm always afraid that I'm going to drop it. I love how clear the text is, it is so easy to read. I wouldn't dream of ever buying another brand of E-reader. I had been using my Kindle 2nd generation keyboard for 10 years and I really hated having to retire it, but it's been years since it would hold a charge and I couldn't have WiFi turned on without having it plugged in to a power source. I also love the Moko case I bought to go with it. It's a perfect fit at half the price as the Amazon case."
Georgia Girl,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Neat device. Makes reading in bed much easier, fits comfortably in palm of hand. Day/Night adjustment with wide range of light intensity. Soft light, easy on the eyes. Convenient for travel eliminating book toting. Holds charge for very long time. I have only charged it twice in two months and probably did not have to with it being at 40% each time. With the leather cover it feels complete and does not slip from your hand. I like that you can see how long it takes to read the book. User friendly features in tool bar. Huge capacity for downloading books. I have not tested the water feature and probably will not on purpose. I take it with me when I leave the house like a friend.
Cons: No page numbers! Whoa! Percentage of book read is not helpful to me. Big disappointment. Some areas of the screen are very sensitive to touch and changes page numbers when you do not want to. It took me a while to learn to avoid the power button. I wonder if it would be better at the top but no biggie.
I would like to see two updates to the Paperwhite - change location of power button and give me page numbers please. I like this device overall. Thank you to the manufacturing staff,"
DG,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was excited to trade up my Paperwhite for the new waterproof one. I regret doing it. Being waterproof isn’t enough to justify the terrible battery life. I recently charged it to full, then removed it from the charger and kept it closed and off for a week. When I turned it on to read, the battery was dead! Totally dead, with a battery symbol on the screen. When I am reading normally the battery drains super fast too. I missing my old Kindle that worked great and the battery lasted forever."
P. hall,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like it. I got the bundle with the head phones. I can walk around the house or sit and listen to a audible book. I can crochet or sew while listening. I would recommend the combo.

It does not come with instructions but I have used a nook for several years so had some idea.

I can also download audible or e book from my library to the kindle. That is great and no trips to library.

Would recommend."
Molly,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased my Kindle Paperwhite in early January 2019. By April 2019, half of the screen was fading out and flickering. Not only that. Even though I followed the instructions on Amazon, it would no longer stay charged. I'm trying to get it replaced and have no idea how to get Amazon to replace it. At this point, I'm not sure I even want to replace it. I guess it's back to regular books for me."
Chandra,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Did not like the experience of using Kindle. Additionally, the trade-in program is not useful at all. I would advise against any upgrade options with Amazon devices- the team is poor at keeping their end of the deal. I just wasted more than 1 hour talking to customer service, only to realize there is no call support for trade-in! Overall, 1 of 5 experience of going through the Kindle upgrade program."
Dorothy Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm happy with this new Kindle. I had one of the older versions and I wanted more options with the font size. I got with this one. I also got a fun little button that lets me return my library books directly from the Kindle. That was a pleasant surprise. Other than that, this Kindle is very much like my old one, and I loved my old one. I was glad that it wasn't that much different. Just a silly thing, but I also enjoy that it's blue - my favorite color. I'm glad I upgraded."
Marjay's Reading Blog,4.0 out of 5 stars,"In general, I am very happy with my new kindle.

I noted some of the negative items others spoke of:
I do not think there is a huge wait before it opens
I do not think it takes too long to load a book

Positive items for me that are key
It holds all my books
and it is easy to hold and to read.

My ONE real negative comment: The battery life listed is not real. At least not for a reader! I still have to plug my kindle in at least weekly so I do not run out of power."
design,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very hesitant about getting a Kindle because being over 70 I like the feel of a book! Also, I am one of those people that can manage to find a problem with any electronic devise I use (as a patient in ER, 3 EKG machines failed). My one saving grace, my husband is an IT guy. However, after using it for a little over a month I love it. I love the following features that lets you choose the print size, the background lighting, dictionary, page save. The one improvement I would like to see is a pronunciation feature. With the help of my husband I'm becoming more confident in using the different features."
Juan David Sánchez,1.0 out of 5 stars,"That's one feature I was really expecting in this new kindle. With audio capabilities, it should include the immersion reading function, but strangely it only allos to read or to listen the books. It doesnt allow to read and listen at the same time."
B Howard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the new Kindle Paperwhite. I was previously using the Kindle Voyage but decided to purchase the all new Paperwhite because of the waterproof and Bluetooth features. With the Voyage, I missed the audio feature.

I have enjoyed using my Bluetooth headphones with the audiobooks through my Kindle. I can listen to a book without disturbing my husband while he is sleeping. I also enjoy the audio on days when it is uncomfortable to hold my Kindle - which is extremely lightweight.

Another great feature is the size. My Kindle, even in a case, fits perfectly in a front pocket of my backpack. I do not have to dig inside of my back pack to hunt for it.

Thanks Amazon!"
LeeAnne,5.0 out of 5 stars,Battery lasts forever and the fact I can sit and read in direct sunlight with no glare made this thing worth the purchase. I'm so excited!
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this version because the comparison chart said it had WiFi and cellular connectivity. It doesn't. It only has WiFi so get ALL your downloads done BEFORE any trips otherwise you'll be disappointed to find yourself unable to open your books as they are unavailable as they are in the cloud rather than on your device.
Jami,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish it was easier to turn the backlight on or off. And since I only use the very lowest setting at night or in low light or not at all, I really don't need the scroll bar of light settings. But when I turn it on in the dark and then can't see to put it my unlock passcode or see the settings button to turn on the backlight, I get frustrated. I had the very first original kindle and I had the second generation twice. This is my first of the touchscreen and backlighted versions."
VWat,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like it. My last paperwhite had started having battery issues and shutting down randomly. The new paperwhite is basically the same,a little smaller, the screen is flush and seems smoother to the touch. It's supposed to be waterproof which I have yet to test out. Battery life is ok. I guess it will last about a week for the average reader if you turn off the wifi. The ability to hear audiobooks is a great addition but. It is only blue tooth compatible. Having a headphone jack would be nice. But overall im not disappointed with my purchase."
Lynnetta4096,2.0 out of 5 stars," For some reason I get a black screen when I turn the page. It happens randomly which makes me think it’s a glitch. The touch screen is sensitive in some places. In other places it doesn’t seem to work well. I am going to call product support this week. With this being over $100, I am expecting it to run smoother than this. Unless this is how it works. If that’s the case, it’s unfortunate. Battery life is great. Lighting is perfect."
Lael Beckwith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: While the power button placement is still annoying it is now overshadowed by my recent experience of putting this through the washing machine and sustaining NO DAMAGE! Kudos to Amazon for your waterproofing prowess.

My only complaint on this device is really the placement of the power button, which is regularly pushed by accident due to it's location on the bottom right hand of the device, right where I hold it or rest it while reading. I love the waterproofing - Great for a the hot tub or bath tub!"
Sonny spencer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had a few kindle’s and also have the latest Nook from b&n. To compare the two, I love both. The kindle has a light for night reading and it’s a great feature. I’ll spend the extra couple bucks for a lighted screen. The double the space is helpful. It was 4GB now it’s 8GB. The weight is great and it’s easy to hold in one hand. I like the screen is flat now all the way across and now bezels. I just need to find a case for it. I love the packaging where it’s simple and thin. Amazon did great adding the Audible to this. You just need Bluetooth headphones or Bluetooth speaker to use Audible since there’s no speaker."
verirh50,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded my old Paperwhite and original Kindle into get the newest version. Because I do take it everywhere with me, I wanted to have a waterproof version as I carry mine with me in all kinds of weather and this was a feature that was important to me. I really like my kindle and use it at a minimum of two hours per day. The screen back light is very adjustable for all kinds of lighting situations. I have no problems reading it, day or night. If you have an older Kindle, this version is a solid upgrade, especially if you trad in your old Kindle."
Christopher Miller,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I almost didn't notice that I was getting the version ""with adds"" - OK, but don't force me to use a lock screen!?! I want the button to simply turn off the screen then bring me back to my book, I don't want an extra step (swipe, after pressing button) - either let me just swipe (without pressing button) or let me disable lock screen.

But even more upsetting is that I can't actually disable ""Buy now with 1-click"" - I tried, but it STILL shows that stupid button when I look at ebooks.

WTF Amazon?!?!!!"
mdh,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like being able to take my books with me anywhere and with a decent battery life. It is easy to turn the pages and I like that you can enjoy the fonts. I am used to reading on my iPad which I like better because it is bigger, pages turn more easily and I can get into the iPad quickly. I always have to put my code in each time, no fingerprint or face recognition. The Kindle is also as heavy as my iPad although it is half the size. I am glad to have it as I can throw it in my purse easily. I do wish it was easier to find my books and wish the book covers were in color, but for the price, how can I really complain."
Fairfield 54,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant about purchasing a Kindle. I love books and everything about them. I love the Kindle. you can adjust the light, sit in the sun (no glare) turning pages is easy. While I will never give up my books completely, my Kindle goes with me everywhere. The battery life is great and the size is perfect. I now can take a 500 page book and have it be as thin as my Kindle."
yilmaz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a very nice tool to read books. Backlighting makes reading easier. Size is very nice to hold. That is the second time i bought it. First time i mistakenly stepped on it and broke it but this time i will be extra carefull while using on bed. Battery is strong, you can use it for a whole week without charging.it has also wireless connection that makes easier to download books from Amazon store."
Dave Broadbent,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Every time I use my new Paperwhite, I want to write another negative review. I really hate the recent interface updates. I definitely find myself using my iPhone Kindle app A LOT more since purchasing this (to replace a stolen Paperwhite 1st Gen).

I'll say it again. It's almost unusable to use. The interface design is complete rubbish. And yet, its the best screen on the market in its class and I want a good screen for outdoor sunny reading. So - I'm stuck with an interface that makes reading difficult... so as to have a screen that makes reading easier. In the end - it's a wash. I rarely use it. If/when it's stolen, I can't imaging even caring (I was really sad when my 1st gen disappeared)."
Nancy Solak,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So mad at myself for putting my water bottle in the same bag as my Paper-white! This new water-resistant one is awful. It turns on when I put it in my purse. So, before leaving to go somewhere, the button on the bottom has to be pressed until I can turn the screen off. It wakes up when I pick it up just move it. It takes hours to recharge. If I leave it alone for a day it loses it's energy--down to zero! If you've got an older version, keep it. This one has no additional benefits."
E. Foster,4.0 out of 5 stars,I must say I was extremely disappointed to find that the Bluetooth only works with purchased books with the audio option and Audible books. Books that you haven't bought the extra audio premium doesn't play with text-to-speech. So nothing but Amazons more expensive books can be listened too. I would never have bought the new Bluetooth kindle and Bluetooth speaker if I had known that.
Pat W,3.0 out of 5 stars,This is my 4th Kindle and I’m very disappointed with it. The quality seems down and the touchscreen barely works. The battery was at 86% before I went to bed and is down to 68% after reading for an hour. My other kindle has a great battery and much better touchscreen. I’m turning this one.
Mark Lindeman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite is a great eBook reader that is easy to use and has a few excellent features. I like being able to look up words, and the included Word Wise feature is nice, however a little elementary. I had to disable Word Wise as it would automatically give me definitions for simple words even after I turned down the setting to display minimal hints and was distracting to what I am reading.
The screen is easy to read in all lighting that I have experienced so far, even outdoor sunny weather, which is nice. It is easy to put books on it you already own, I have checked out books through OverDrive and that process works very well. The multiple ways of getting books is easy and straight forward, it is easy to browse through Kindle Books.
The touchscreen is sometimes finicky as far as registering touch inputs but it is not too bad and only slightly interferes with my use. It hasn't given me any problems with page turning, but sometimes selecting items requires a second tap.
Overall I am very pleased with the Paperwhite, the main reason I got it was for school eTextbooks, and the highlighting feature is nice, as well as looking up words and taking notes.
The battery life is good, and I have only had to charge it once so far, but it seems to charge quickly. I do not use the Experimental Browser so I can not comment on that.The layout of the home screen is nice but I wish there were more options to customize that and for sorting books."
Kim,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't planning on trading my Kindle Paperwhite 3GB in for the new waterproof 8GB version but so glad I did. I usually use my kindle outside at the beach or by the pool so the waterproof caught my attention. But after having this almost a month I'm amazed at the battery life. They say it holds a charge for 2 weeks and I thought ""sure"" but I haven't plugged this in for over 3 weeks and it is still at 79%. Seems my other kindles, whether I used them or not the battery would deplete. So happy I have this new latest version."
Mr. Stephen S. Hendricks,1.0 out of 5 stars,Of course it was to be used for reading books. I just hate it. I have had at least 4 other kindles (DX) but this is just plain poor for use by elderly and to everyone on my floor I simply do not recommend it. It can not tolerate a shaky hand nor broad based finger tips and the instructions are sheer hell to navigate. You could never sell me another device.
FCGal,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Kindle. I finally upgraded from the keyboard Kindle, and I'm so pleased. The built-in light is easily adjusted, and makes reading in any light so easy. The battery life is good, but to conserve my battery, I use airplane mode. The touch screen is a bit quirky to navigate, though--I haven't decoded how to highlight on a page without moving to the next or previous page. Sometimes I can do it; other times, it takes three or four attempts to get the highlight done without changing pages. All in all, I'm thrilled with this new Kindle. It's quite an upgrade from the keyboard version!"
Windy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that it's waterproof because when I really need me time I jump in the tub with a book. The waterproof case is amazing as well, it comes in fun colors and feels great in your hands. Another upgrade is that the screen doesn't have an edge for dirt and pet hair to get trapped in. My first e-reader died from too much cat hair so I'm happy that won't be a problem. It's great having my audio books in the same library. I am on a mission to cut down my phone time as an example to my son so this is a lifesaver. Comics even look great on this device. Oh and did I mention that you can now sync your reading to your goodreads account? Kindles are awesome!"
Z. Weiss,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The kindle paperwhite has always been the best kindle, both for price and form factor. The back light has always been perfect, able to be adjusted for high or low light situations. Literally the only thing that was missing was waterproofing it, and they have done. I was considering buying a kindle oasis, but the price tag was too high, and now that the paperwhite has waterproofing, I am so satisfied. The only thing I don’t like is that the screen goes all the way to the end now, and there is no rubber bezzle surrounding the screen. I am happy to say, however, that is not enough to take away one star. This new version feels like the old one, except lighter and quicker. Oh, and you can change fonts on this one, which I don’t think you could do before"
amazonreview,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited to write a review for a couple weeks to make sure I could clearly think through my disappointment over this purchase. I have high standards for technology and was really excited reading about the newest kindle, the specs, and all the glowing positive reviews. I bought this kindle as a Christmas gift to myself and was let down by the quality. The whole thing felt a bit cheap and the screen refresh made the device unusable in my opinion. Every time I scrolled or flipped the page the whole screen would flash and pixels would refresh at different rates. To add insult to injury the cord that came with the device wouldn't plug in to the kindle; I tried another microUSB and had no issues. Due to these factors I decided the kindle wasn't going to be something that I would use. So I started the return process. I shipped the kindle back on 12/27/18 and I understand that because of New Years the package delivery was delayed. I checked the tracking number for the return and it arrived on 1/4/19. Today is 1/9/19 and Amazon's return tracker still says refund will start when package arrives to facility. Overall I'm just really disappointed in this whole process."
BoyMomX3,3.0 out of 5 stars,"While the Paperwhite itself is nice, light weight, great screen, easy to read in the sunlight..

The actual job of getting books on there is the problem. Navigating the local library website to borrow a book was like using a cellphone circa 1999. I returned it- for a kindle fire instead. Yes, it’s heavier, bigger and less visible in the sun (I don’t read in the sun anyway), I have no problems getting books from wherever I want! And in the end, that’s most important to me!"
Wes,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say this is the absolute worst piece of tech I've ever purchased. Not intuitive at all. Further, the support for this device is absolutely atrocious. The ""free"" 3-month unlimited subscription that comes with the device cannot be applied to a child account, and has been permanently registered to my account, which does no good at all, as the Kindle is not mine. I really didn't think I could find a piece of tech worse than my wife's MacBook, but here it is...."
SuzAnne,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the new Kindle Paperwhite with its audio Bluetooth and waterproof/resistance feature. Now I read or listen to books while floating in the pool, without any fear that the Kindle might fall into the water. I would put my older Paperwhite inside a Ziploc bag for protection, and I would only be able to stay in the pool for a few minutes before my anxiety got the best of me.

The only thing I can say is the touch screen on the newe one seems to be a bit difficult to line up with the icons."
Marshall,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First, let me just say that this is one of the best purchases I have ever made. If you wait for a bit, there will probably be a Kindle sale and you can get it for $99.99 or less. That makes this a really good deal- $10 more than the basic Kindle

Positives-
- water resistant!! I’ve already had it in the rain so I’m glad it has this feature!
- the screen gets lit up!! This is AWESOME! Because of this, I can read at almost any time of the day, without ever needing a clip on light or anything like that!
- high resolution screen

Negatives
- BLUE TINT!!! One of the only things that I can complain about is the blue tint of the screen!!!
- Micro-USB. We can move on to USB Type C or even a proprietary port, but let’s just not use Micro-USB."
Bibliophile,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a Kindle Fire but found it was difficult to read in the sunlight. Since we were about to take a trans-Atlantic cruise and anticipated a lot of reading time, I decided to get this Kindle Paper-white. The battery life is excellent, and I can read the Kindle in bright sunlight. I do have a little trouble with the touchscreen, but perhaps that will improve in time."
Katya Zaimov,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable size, easy to carry around and easy to read, but only suitable for certain books. Don’t ever buy it if you read how-to books or field guides! All the illustrations are black and white! Completely useless for the kind of books I like to read. So, I ended up reading this type of books on my small phone, where all the colors are amazing and the pictures can be enlarged. But the battery doesn’t last like the Kindle and is straining my failing eyes. I wish that anywhere in the description they mentioned this simple fact! I may have chosen different device. If you read fiction or nonfiction without illustrations, this is the device for you. Really non-straining and easy on the eyes."
Peylix,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Huge improvement over my Paperwhite from 2013. I loved my old one but it's battery was finally showing its age. So I finally replaced it.

Love the bigger storage, water resistance, improved backlight, and design. The flush face really makes the new Paperwhite feel more ""premium"" over the inset design of older models.

I do wish they kept the same dimensions of the old though. I have a leather mag case for my old model that is JUST barely too big. Had to shell out another $40 for another OEM case.

Already enjoying the fresh battery. I've knocked out 6 hours of reading first day after a full charge and the battery is still in the 90% range. My old Paperwhite would be dead on hour 5.

Overall, nice step up. Looking forward to using this for years to come."
Landmarks Notify Humor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’d held on to my 5th generation Kindle for a good while, but after a friend’s recommendation, I decided make the leap to latest version of the Paperwhite—and I love it. The touchscreen is terrific, a truly nice step-up from the buttons I’d been using on my older Kindle. Of course, I’m thrilled with the reading light that I don’t have to think about it, and I could not be happier with the clarity of the screen. It’s super-lightweight, too, making reading comfortable. I haven’t had an opportunity to test to waterproof nature of the new Kindle Paperwhite, but I’m glad to know it’s there. I’m happy to recommend this product."
Love2read,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the battery life on this. I review books and often I read from my computer. Now I don't have to and don't worry about killing my battery life.
The lighting is good. I like to read outside and this is so much better. I fit it in my back pocket and carry everywhere now.
The touch seems a little off to me but touch screen has always been hard for me. For some reason, nothing ever wants to work with my fingers. This is not different.
Next time i buy a kindle I think I will go for a more costly one and see how it works."
Monte K,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle ever. I intentionally bought it because I felt it would be better for my eyes (as tablets and other devices can signal to one's brain to wake up). I LOVE this device. I DID have trouble removing a cover I had bought with another cover, so I Googled how to take it off, which helped. I love that it is waterproof since it is somewhat expensive. I also love how easy it is to navigate. I DID buy a screen protector (there are several to choose from, so I bought one that is actually made of glass). I would recommend buying a screen protector as well as a cover to protect your investment."
Bruce Tracy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like everything about this Kindle so far. It is super compact, waterproof, and the print reads like a paperback. The backlight works great and can be adjusted, depending on how much light you need. I am getting eight to ten days on the battery, depending on how much I read. I turn off the WiFi when I am not using it, and that saves on battery life. There isn't anything not to like about this Kindle."
Aaron Evans,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to this from the kindle dx. I made the mistake of not noting the size. It's much smaller than my old broken DX!

But after using it for a bit, I became immersed in the book. It works 100% fine. It's like reading from my old sci fi books as a kid.

Waterproof. Backlight. Touch Screen.

I was in the dark ages with the DX (clicking the noisy distracting next button).

Planning on hooking it to my bluetooth headphones soon..."
Kathy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The touchscreen has changed from previous versions. I used to be able to hold the device in my left hand and turn the page with my thumb. The fields are different and I now am using two hands. Not used to the wake up feature. I also would like the books in my collections to be hidden unless I want to access them. The most surprising thing is the number of times I have had to restart the device since I purchased it less than eight weeks ago. Hoping that this doesn't continue. Otherwise, I enjoy the convenience of having several books in a lightweight container."
J. Willmore,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The features of this model were great while the device worked. The battery life was not “weeks” long like Amazon claims though, and if the device was left unattended for more than a month I would come back to a dead battery. A month after the warranty expired a dead battery resulted in a dead device. Battery drain protection is pretty standard on electronics but the kindle doesn’t seem to have it. I may buy another kindle refurbished at some point but I won’t pay full price ever again."
Marilynn E. Bearss,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Although I like the new Kindle (this is my third and I am an avid reader), I had to return this one less than a month after I received it since it was not holding a charge. It would be at 100% charged and by midday, it would be at less than 45%, and that was just sitting, not in use."
Kyle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have read ONE book this year, so I am not an expert, but my wife, on the other hand, is a literal speed reader. She has read 361 books so far this year. 332 of those books have been read on this device since I purchased it for her AND SHE LOVES IT. So, take it or leave it, the thing works for her. She doesn't complain about battery life, so I think it lasts as long as she needs it to before plugging it into the wall (total first-world problem!!) She loves it... that's all I can say."
Jennifer Swiger,2.0 out of 5 stars,"While I like the waterproof part and the way it reads but turning pages drives me crazy! It constantly skips pages, “jumps” or doesn’t turn the page when I want it to. There’s just no in between. Not to mention it takes it time to “wake up.” I’m really rather disappointed as I’ve been wanting a paperwhite for years. My wait wasn’t worth it."
Dshopper,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved my old Paperwhite & was devastated when it finally gave up the ghost. Fortunately the timing was perfect to get the new version 10 during Amazon's Cyber Week. I do love that it is waterproof, although not planning to test that feature :) I know that the product information says that it is lighter, but the new one really does feel somewhat heavier than the last. A fine tradeoff for the water resistance IMHO. The downside however is the battery life. I literally had weeks of reading time with my last Paperwhite. I have to charge this one every 3-4 days. This is a serious drawback and inconsistent with the product information provided by Amazon. Overall a great device - easy to use, more intuitive commands & great capacity. Had the battery life been the same as the previous versions, it would definitely rate 5 stars"
Robert Llamas,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a Kindle Paperwhite. 2 days after I received it, it stopped working.
I returned it, and was sent another one. After the first day, IT stopped working. I returned that one, and was sent a third one. NOW, it does not work properly. I need to return the 3rd one. I don't know if they are all bad, or I am just unlucky.
These were to replace my Original Kindle. which I had no problem with. I was offered the ""opportunity"" to upgrade, and that is when the whole then started."
V. Gibson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Quicker, brighter, waterproof and less buggy than my very old 2gb Kindle. I don't see how I could possibly use up the 8gb on this new Paperwhite. The waterproofing on the new ones may be important to you but wasn't a factor for me.
I only upgraded because my old Kindle was acting weird.
None of the newer Kindles we've owned had a battery life to last ""weeks"". Only the very, very, old keyboard Kindles we owned have had battery life that truly lasted weeks."
Brandyn Lessman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the size. It is easy to carry, does not slip in-hand. It is extremely late I often forget I even have it with me until I find it in my purse! I love the optional settings with the backlight to paper white screen. There is a slight delay in changes which I believe is expected with this sort of technology. The one thing I dislike is the delay in screen-prompts, but thats minimal compared to everything else. I also cannot get my library to sink up if I purchase from another device without dedicating at least a solid 30min to figuring out the process each time. Simply selecting ""Sync Library"" on my kindle hasn't worked yet, and instead I have to go to whatever device I purchased from and sync it then get back on my kindle amd try to sync the library again, so I wait until I have several books at once to sync before I do so."
Y. Werde,3.0 out of 5 stars,"On/off switch protrudes on bottom side causing the device to shut off when it is stood or leaned up for hands free reading. Device sometimes even reboots. Switch should be recessed

Ok for sequential reading. Not useful for research type reading were you need to jump between topics.

The built in browser is substandard. Sometimes you have to authenticate to a WiFi portal to connect. Pages are illegible and browsing is real slow

Kindle Reader should have page scrolling & searching just like in the pc and iOS versions"
ira,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The entire Kindle customer service department is outsourced abroad where the call quality is awful and other calls from within the same office drown out the representative's voice. The product itself is average and not worth the cost. I wanted an e-reader without the intensity of the typical screen, so I was drawn to this. But it's often slow, and the lagged response to stimuli results in unexpected interactions. The UI could be more intuitive. Between the lack of quality in the product and the service, I am transferring my shopping elsewhere entirely."
Teach Philly,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned a few kindles in my time and this is by far my worst ""upgrade"" The only thing this paperwhite has going for it is that it is waterproof. However I don't even fit in my bathtub and underwater reading isn't a hobby of mine. So the waterproofing is just a gimmick really.

The thing that kills this kindle for me is that it is so damn bright! My previous non waterproof kindle paperwhite version could get much dimmer such that I didn't feel like I was staring at a bright rectangle when I was reading in bed.

Pros:
- Its a kindle. Any e-reader is better than lugging around a paper version of any George RR Martin novel.
- The totally flat front face is pretty nice
- It is super light
- higher screen resolution is cool too

Cons:
- It is SO BRIGHT. When ever would you need it on the brightest setting. And the lowest setting isn't even feasible when trying to read in bed in a dark room.
- The bottom power button juts out and is very easy to press. I commonly hold the bottom of my devices with my pinky and I've accidentally turned this damn thing off more than a couple of times.
- Turning it on takes quite a bit longer than my previous kindle paperwhite.
- Turning it on flashes the screen to full brightness. So if you wake up in the middle of the night and decide to read a chapter of your book you better put on your sunglasses first.
- The home screen interface is getting so much more annoying. Amazon stop trying to sell me more stuff. We all know you're going to take over the world soon anyway, and the paltry money you make from my book purchases is not going to make that much of a difference.

Additional notes:
- Don't tell me I should read with my bed light on anyway. I know about your blue-light hatred, and I agree, but I'm not switching over my library to that yellow nook rectangle.
- Don't tell me I should invert the colors of my kindle to make it less bright. That's just dumb. I did it and I hate it.
- Who the hell needs 8 gb of memory for books?
- The only reason I had to get this latest generation is that I'm an idiot and lost my old one on a plane.
- If the waterproofing feature changed your life for the better. Please let me know, I'm curious about the conditions you read under."
Diego Hernandez,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good upgrade from my basic Kindle bought like five years ago.

What I like:

- Waterproof
- Good PPI quality
- Finally Audiobook capable
- performance is okay
- lightweight
- Battery without listening Audio book is all right
- backlight at night is eye comfortable

What I dont like

- I cannot read and listens to audiobooks at the same time. Thing It can actually be possible from the kindle app on smartphones and tablets. I loved doing this as a person who is still learning english.

- Battery duration gets a bit compromised while listening audiobooks only.

Overall, it was a good purchase and I'm happy with it."
William,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an engineering student and bought this to read pdf and amazon rentals of textbooks. While it did this alright (better than a computer monitor), I found it really helpful in reading assignments. My professors give coding assignments through pdf files and the first thing I do is email them to my kindle. They are easy to read (I am 21 with decent eye sight so I can see the small text), and are a lot easier on my eyes than the monitor. My only real complaint is that it doesn't really have much support with other eBook providers such as VitalSource (textbook provider). If it would have supported VitalSource eBooks I would have given it 5/5 stars.

It does, however, do really well with the content it was designed to read. I subscribed to a newspaper and read it right before bed. The e-ink display does really well and the adjustable backlit screen makes it really nice to read at night. I would easily recommend it to any casual/recreational reader and would consider it for students, given it fits with how they like to study."
jp,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The new paperwhite Kindle is ok to read books on, but the touch screen is touchy. Sometimes it will turn more than one page and if I am not careful how I hold, it can go back a page.
The home page is way too busy. Can’t seem to get read books off of home page.
Don’t want to know about all the books that that I will not read anyway.
Just because a device has the capability to do virtully everything that doesn’t mean that that makes using the device better."
D. Causwell,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only had this kindle for three days, so I don't know how it will work.
Got my first Kindle in 2012, that one lasted about three years. I am now at number 5.
All I can say is they must be very poorly made. I also have a kindle fire, maybe two years old and now has a battery life of only three hours. Don't want any more kindles. Can someone suggest what else I can buy when number five dies??"
Sarah,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the 3rd kindle I’ve owned now. My first was the original back in 2011, second was a paper white in 2014, and now this one! I really love it BUT after reading the booklet that came with it I found out it is NOT WATERPROOF but water resistant! The battery also doesn’t last weeks for the avid reader like myself. The battery life doesn’t really bother me but the false advertising as “waterproof” does. Overall I love my new kindle and look forward to using it!!"
Lucero Z.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am in love! I love reading but having two kids ages 2 and 10 months leaves me with little to no time to sit and read. Having a kindle I can hold in one hand in the dark while breastfeeding has been the best thing ever. I love book holding them but for now I can not realistically do that the kindle provides me with a way to still do and enjoy what I love reading.
It’s slick and lightweight I can take it anywhere. The pages and the color look like a real book! I can carry multiple books in one sleek kindle that fits practically anywhere versus carrying only 1-2 books for the lack of room and hands to hold them. Also my nephew split seltzer water on it and all I had to do was wipe it down nothing happened to it talk about the best thing ever! I must say I am converted. Do yourself a favor and get it you will not regret anything other than not getting it sooner."
Kelly B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Kindle paper white as a gift and it is the best gift ever. I read a lot and have trouble with pain in my wrists and thumb from holding a traditional book open for any length of time. The kindle has solved this problem. I love that you can adjust the screen brightness and text size. I bought a case so i can prop it up or leave it flat while reading. The battery lasts a long time before needing to recharge. My first charge was with the included USB and attached it to my computer, it took a few hours but that may have been because it was its first charge. I bought an AC adapter for it and charged it when it had 12% battery left and it charged in under an hour. Love it!"
Jen S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After going on Amazon to order yet another book, I decided to look into an e-reader because it would be convenient to have many of my books in one portable place. After comparing different models, the paperwhite emerged as the right choice for me. It is a comfortable size to hold while reading and the battery lasts me 2 weeks. Sometimes the touch screen lags a little but it’s not too bad. I prefer to browse for books on my phone or computer and then send them to my kindle versus browsing on the kindle but it’s fine in a pinch. I don’t believe mine supports our 5G wifi, so that’s another consideration (we have 2G as well and that’s the only one that shows up). I wanted a reader and not a tablet so none of these things are deal breakers for me. This kindle meets my needs well, such as reading in the sun, the dark, and on the go, and I look forward to using it more."
OUTDesigns,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Rediculously horrid processing. The home page and subsequent book pages turn in ""chunks"" (like an old Blackberry). This may have been acceptable 10 years ago, but is completely outdated now. Additionally, the screen never gets bright . . . Never.

I'm literally stuck with a piece of junk hardware . . . and this would be an embarrassment to give as a gift.

I cannot believe this is actually for sale. All these ""positive"" reviews cannot be real."
Matthew E Melley,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took me a long time to finally convert over to E-books. I like the paper feel and look over anything electronic. That being said, the convenience of an E-reader cannot be argued. The Paperwhite is honestly the best of both worlds. Minimal eye strain and perfect amount of light for all environments. After reading for a short time it is possible to forget that you are reading on a tablet, your brain being convinced that what you are looking at is actually made of paper. This is an excellent product for anyone interested in a tablet for reading purposes only. I would highly recommend this reader to anyone that loves to read."
Denstl,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Went from using the Kindle app on my iPad to the Kindle. Overall, love it. Just one design feature I really do not like. The power button is on the bottom of the device. When reading in bed I all too often press it while trying to hold the device. It turns it off so I have to re-open it. Wish it was on top instead. Other than that, it's perfect. Wish I could give a 1/2 star so I could rate it 4 1/2 stars. Can't give it 5 stars with that design issue, but it really deserves more than 4 stars."
Anna,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Kindle products and have had (probably) 18 years of total use between 3 Kindles in the household. We have never had an issue with the screen, until now. This Kindle lasted all of 3 months until the screen broke. Now it’s completely unusable!
But rather than an “accident” or “misuse,” the issue here is poor quality or a design flaw. This “new and improved” model was replacing my son’s 5-yr old Kindle Paperwhite that was not holding charge anymore. So he got 5 years out of old model but only 3 months out of this “new and improved” (and he was even more careful now.)
Save your money— look for a different e-reader. (Who reads under water anyway?!?)"
Stephanie Mason,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited to write this review.
I've read 64 books on this tablet. When you're actually using it the charge doesn't stay as long as you would think.
I use my Samsung tablet to browse books on store. Because it's hard to do on reader. If you're trying to decide between one with internet abilities the internet super slow there's no processing speed.
I do like to read outside with it. And late night.
But I find a used my tablet more for reading still."
Ken,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all the machine works fine. The only thing is it is just like the one I have had for three or four years. I do not use the blue tooth feature and I do not take it boating, swimming or in the shower.
I there are many features which I have not explored because I use it as a reader.
The battery does last longer.
I may had been expecting something thinner and lighter because of the hype. I cannot tell the difference between the new one and the old.
Check the features before you trade up."
Susan P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My only concern is not having the ability to highlight in different colors. When I read on my IPhoneI can do that, but not on the Kindle itself. I share my Kindle with my husband, so it would be nice to be able to differentiate between our markings. That is such a small thing that I don't believe it's enough to take away from the 5 star rating."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wouldn't recommend the Kindle Paperwhite to anyone looking for a good Kindle to read on. I was hesitant to buy it after having had a Kindle Fire for years but I figured I didn't need the Fire anymore since I don't really do anything other than read on it (no playing games/using apps/etc...). I have only had the Paperwhite for TWO MONTHS and it takes forever to download books, hesitates to turn the pages and as of last night the pictures on my home screen are burnt into the screen so that while I'm reading a book I can still see the pictures of my home screen behind all the words. The only thing I like about the Paperwhite is that the battery lasts a long time. I can fully charge it and read for at least a week before I need to charge it again. Other than that, it's awful and was a complete waste of my money. I should have just replaced my Kindle Fire!!!"
kstraughn,3.0 out of 5 stars,I like the light weightless of this Kindle. However it does not hold a battery charge like my hold one. I charged this morning and the battery drained to 16% after reading for 2 hours. Twice it has automatically turned off while I was reading.
twilightmom33,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I moved from another very popular eReader to the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite eReader. I worried about the change because I have used the other brand for so long, but did not want to pay the astronomical price to update to a newer one. So I talked to some friends and did some research and decided that I would try out the new paperwhite and I DO NOT regret that decision. It is easy to borrow books from the library or kindle unlimited. Also buying them from Amazon is a breeze. I love, love, love, that you can also listen to audio with a Bluetooth device. If you will put the Kindle on airplane mode when you don't need it connected to WIFI the battery will last for days. This device by far is my favorite device and I have even personalized it with a case of my own taste. It is easy to modify the settings to fit your reading needs.
The next big challenge for me is converting my other eReader books to my Kindle. :)
If you are looking for an affordable, easy to use, awesome eReader I highly recommend the new Kindle Paperwhite."
David J Gill,2.0 out of 5 stars,"A wonderful product, BUT.
Text can be enlarged for those with vision problems, BUT your list of books on the device can not be enlarged and the book cover thumbnails are low resolution/grayscale images that are equally illegible for someone with vision problems. The person I bought this for found this to be an insurmountable problem.

It's a pity Amazon can't test these products (I'm sure they do, but it is obviously inadequate) with readers and make the product completely accessible for someone who needs to use large text.

We are returning it; what a hassle!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Been going back and forth about buying one of these for years. Glad I finally did it! The backlight is perfect at night and in the sun. The storage (even the smaller one) is plenty. The battery life seems to last forever. The touch screen is not super sensitive and sometimes takes a few clicks... but I'm so used to phones being extra sensitive. Also, it's smaller than I expected. I'm a lover of real paper books, but this is perfect and convenient to travel with!"
dawn keith,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ended up getting this as a gift and my husband joked around that it was Dawn proofed because I tend to drop a lot of things because my hands don't work as well as they used to and the screen is durable it's waterproof I even got a case that my hand can slip into a strap be able to hold it so I won't be dropping it and the light from it actually doesn't bother my husband's eyes when I'm reading while he's asleep during the night when I'm having trouble sleeping and it's super lightweight and it doesn't fatigue my hands to hold
Mars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had bought the first gen Paperwhite, back in 2013. Since then, however, I had put off upgrading to the later versions. I decided to go ahead and trade my older Kindle in, when they announced this newer model. I love that they got rid of the bevels, since it was always so hard for me to clear out the dust and debris. The audiobook feature was also pretty neat, perfect, given I had both a bluetooth speaker and earbuds! I feel I've gotten the most use out of them from my audiobooks. The battery life seems as good as my previous model (but I suppose heavy or lighter usage is a factor, and varies per person). Definitely way thinner, even with the water-safe, fabric cover. Haven't tested the water-proof (resistant) feature, but don't plan on dunking it in a bowl of water, either lol. Overall, I am very happy with this new model!"
HilltownRoots,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My 7-year-old Kindle just didn't have the battery life that it used to have, so I figured I'd upgrade to the latest. A sale price and a trade in allowance was incentive. But, I don't notice all the new features - like thinner, lighter, better screen resolution, etc. And the Home screen is different and it took me a while to find my saved books. Battery life is better as expected, but I'm disappointed that the improvements aren't more dramatic. The dimensions are subtilly smaller requiring a new case - an added expense."
Yangsian,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I already bought this device, and I buy dozens of e-books every year. Stop selling me stuff! The Kindle interface will not stop giving me recommendations and special offers. I don't want to live in a hypermarket. Stop! The touch screen functionality is also poor, slow to react and not nearly as feature-rich as the Kindle software on an iPad. Good things:
glare-free screen
lightness and portability
battery life
surprisingly easy to read on despite the small size"
Nichole N.M. Nash,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The New Kindle Paperwhite is a great purchase. I love that it’s small enough to fit in my purse, it’s easy to travel with, it’s water proof, I can connect to goodreads & all my magazine scriptions/audiobooks. It has a longer battery life and the lighting is a whole lot better. Also I especially love that it’s just for reading without the other apps etc. However, I would love for this device to be in color with the option of adding a SD card for extra storage space. Overall I’m glad I purchased this."
MaryLaura,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never really thought about buying one of these. I loved a book rather than reading on a device such as this although I bought my husband one when they first came out and he loves it. However on a recent plane trip, I had difficulty reading because the cabin was dark and my overhead light was very dim and aimed wrong. I thought then I needed to rethink a Kindle. So glad I did. This one is small and does not take up so much room in my bag. Easy to read and also easy to navigate. The lit background is easy on the eyes. Charge lasts a very long time. Good purchase on my part!"
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I wasn’t sure about this Kindle. This is my fourth Kindle. I was not prepared with how small it is, not sure why.
Then I reminded myself why I purchased this Kindle. I take it when I go the Doctors office or anywhere I am sitting and waiting. It fits in my purse perfectly and doesn’t take up a lot of room. I really like being able to adjust the lighting and size of the print. Also it recommends books based on my tastes. I really like this Kindle and would recommend it."
Raoul,5.0 out of 5 stars,When I first got the package I thought I had made a mistake and it was too small. After using it for a few weeks I couldn't be happier with it. It's very light so long evening reading sessions don't get tiring at all. I don't miss the hardware buttons a bit I was reading on my phone before so taping the side of the screen to turn pages is natural for me. If I wanted to be very picky I'd say they should have put the power button at the top instead of the bottom. Sometimes when I'm holding it one handed I accidentally turn it off with my thumb. But it's fast to wake up so not even worth knocking down a star for that. My biggest problem now is to decide that it's time to stop reading and go to sleep.
landshark1210,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was expecting it to be a bit faster but there wasn't much of a difference. Also, touch screen sensitivity could be better. In MN during the winter, you hands get dry and the screen doesn't sense it as well. But overall, I love my Kindle Paperwhite.
Caution: they do not put any packing material in the box and the box is huge compared to the Kindle. There is a lot of room for it to bounce around so make sure you take it out and put it through its paces immediately!"
Deborah Adler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband bought the Kindle Paperwhite for the both of us to share and it's working out wonderfully. It's a great device and holds SO many books. We discovered we check out eBooks from our local library and read them on our new Kindle Paperwhite. The battery life is great, the readability of the screen is perfect and it is easy to navigate from book to book. I gave the touch screen only 4 stars as there is a little delay when touching the screen from one thing to the next; otherwise, it's GREAT!"
Cecly Ann Mitchell,2.0 out of 5 stars,Nobody show buy this device. It is the absolute get on my nerve device. I am really upset with this item..Disappointed does not even come close to how I am feeling right now. The interface is choppy. I dumping this and sticking with the Kindle App for Ipad.. AMAZON SHOULD GIVE THIS AWAY FREEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Chi-Wen Tiao,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was pretty hesitant before I made my decision to buy. I already own an iPad, and owning another reader seemed unnecessary. The advertisement was so nicely made, and the thanksgiving deal was way too tempting, so I ended up placing the order, and now I am soooo happy with this purchase! It's so much lighter, smaller to carry, but so much easier to read. What makes it different from reading on an iPad? No need to worry about the reflection under the sun. It's so thin and light, so it's very gentle on my arm and my shoulder. Not to mention the battery life is so much better, and it doesn't overheat even it's constantly on under the sun. Kindle is made with simple functions---for reading, and this is surprisingly one of the best quality I like about it. I really get distracted too much when I read, and I love how there is zero notification popping out.

As a constant traveler, I love having 1 or 2 books with me in a lounge or in a flight, but my choice of books just become limited to those thing and light ones. Now with this thin and light device, I no longer need to battle to decide which to bring. I still love the feeling of flipping actual paperback version, and the smell of the books. The experience can't be replaced by a kindle, but I am contemplating this with the convenience of bringing several books with me in a pocket."
Turkiye,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Paper white gave up after 13 months. Wouldn’t charge. Amazon employee indicated cable was bad. Ordered cable. Did not fix problem. This is the third Kindle I’ve owned. The longevity and quality of the product is very poor. Technical support is also seems to know little about the product, except have customer order a new one. I’ve foolishly done this because my wife likes this size of the Kindle. A product should last over 13 months. DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED!"
Cee Gee,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Tried all the recommendations. Restarted device and WiFi, double checked WiFi password, manually put in connection information, went to Amazon forums, called Amazon, went to McDonalds and used their WiFi to see if device would work there. Nothing would work. Paperwhite still will not sync or connect to WiFi. Device is registered on Amazon. Frustrating experience. What worked for others would not work for me. After 4 hours of trying to get device to work Amazon sending me a new one."
Thomas H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to begin 2019 with spending more time reading books that would not only expand my knowledge but have enjoyable reading. I haven’t been a reader but wanted to change that and I enjoy the freedom a e-readers provides. I didn’t want a tablet reader but one basic and just did books. The kindle paper white is just that! I chose the paper white for the added benefit of night time reading. I wear glasses and have no troubles reading and love the no glare aspect you get with tablets and I’m a die hard Apple guru, but let’s be real you can’t read very well with a glare off an iPad persay. But love the basic kindle and the ability to read in the go and not having to worry about storing books etc. Buy it! You’ll be glad you did!!"
Marvin Edwards,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not sure why, but it wouldn't turn on this morning. It was (and still is) displaying the background image. But when I pushed the button, nothing happened. I tried charging it, and it wouldn't come on while plugged in. I waited until the light was green, then unplugged it and pushed the button again. Nothing. I tried holding the button for a few seconds. Still nothing. Oh well. I'm charging up my Kindle Fire that I haven't used in a long time, and will use that to pick up where I left off in my book."
Claudia Glaser,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I should have read the description. The touch screen is also not as responsive as my iPad. However, if I fall asleep in the bathtub reading or I’m near the pool, the waterproof qualities are lifesaving. Back to the screen size... it is fine for reading a book, but studying in a textbook, going back and forth between chapters, it plainly... sucks. I do like the non-reflective screen. So overall I’m ambivalent about the purchase. Sorry Amazon. Normally, I’ve got your back"
Ronnymancr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using Kindle readers for more than 10 years and this version is just great!
The shape, the flat screen, the light control.
The battery life is not perfect but you can play with airport settings and backlight in order to get a longer use between charges.
The price is also fair.
There are also many covers for this device so you have tons of design options to buy.
5 stars! Thank you Amazon!"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The most difficult and disappointing thing about this purchase was the trade in offer. Amazon offered me to trade in my 2 older Kindles and receive in return a monetary offer for each device and also a 25% discount on my new device. I sent in the older generations and received only the credit for the cheapest one. They Never credited the money they offered for my device that I was using before I sent it in for the trade. I asked for it to just be returned, but they couldn’t locate it. I was even told that it was my fault for sending in both devices in the same package even though the packaging slip from Amazon showed on package containing both. I had to call Amazon 3 different times. The 2nd and 3rd times I had to go over everything all over again. It was so frustrating! In the end, I did finally get all that I was offered and an additional $5 off of the purchase of my new device and cover. Despite the $5, I will never do the trade in again! $5 was not worth the hassle!

I didn’t rate the battery life because I have only kept it on the charger when not in use.

This new Kindle is a little slower to start than my previous version. This new one shows “warming up” before it opens my book.

Overall I love reading on my Kindle!"
mirmK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally caved and got an e-reader for Christmas. Running out of shelf-space and trying to bring more than 2 books on vacation will convince you, it's time! It is lightweight, does not irritate my eyes, holds 10 books at a time, has a long battery life, and fits in my purse. Turning pages by swiping or touching the corner is easy and intuitive. The interface is easy to use. I don't even mind the adds - some good recommendations for future reading and no accidental purchases. I'm very pleased with it and the Kindle Unlimited program is great so far, too!"
Nana,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I almost didn’t give this a chance. I received it as a gift but I’ve owned a nook from the day they came out. I had it in my head that I wouldn’t like this. After the battery on my nook died I had no choice. I really wanted to read a certain book. Of course I didn’t like it at first. But after a few days I really started to enjoy it. It’s the perfect size. It fits in my purse easily and I have a small purse. The lighting is great. It doesn’t hurt my eyes at all, I like the fact that I can read in the tub without worrying about it getting splashed and I totally love how long the battery life last. I can actually read the whole book without having to charge it. The battery life is so good that I have actually read a few books before needing to charge it. My only gripe is that the battery icon doesn’t show up on the display while your reading. I really prefer having the time and battery life at the top of my page. Honestly there may be a setting for that but I couldn’t find one. Overall, I really do like this kindle."
TomK2,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Would get a 5th star if it had page buttons and the ability to rotate the screen 180 degrees instead of just 90. The power button is on the bottom, and while holding it one handed your pinky will push it off to sleep mode while you are reading it. No hardware change needed, just update to software so we can put the power button on top !"
CIO65,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The menus are not as intuitive as I would like...shutting it down is a bit of a pain...would like a button that I could quickly just tap a couple of times rather than holding the start button for what seems like ten seconds. But, I think the screen is great, downloading books is incredibly fast, and being able to easily hold it one hand is a real bonus. I enjoy taking this on trips...it goes through scanning without having to remove it from my backpack even though it's bigger than a cell phone. Great product!"
Taye Arted,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it. I held on to my second gen kindle for so long; it had been through too much and was finally coming apart. I was nervous about upgrading. I am so pleasantly surprised by this device. The backlight is super convenient, I’m getting used to the touch screen but I do miss the page buttons, and the storage capacity is exciting. All the complaints about battery life appear to be rooted in an inability to lower the brightness. The only thing that I truly disliked(I’ve adjusted) is the button placement on the bottom of the device. I really want to put my pinky there."
Jeffrey A. Phillips,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was excited to get the new kindle paperwhite as a gift. My son damaged the screen of my old kindle and it now has a small crack where light leaks through. It still works fine and holds a charge for a month straight. The new one barely stays charged for a week. I can literally watch the battery life drop while it downloads a book. Amazon is clearly making these as cheaply as possible and all the defects show it.

I’m probably going to just go back to using my old kindle. It’s lasted a few years and is still going strong. I can live with the small crack in the screen easier than I can the new cheaper defective kindle that’s only days away from needing a charge. So much for the longest lasting battery yet.

This is kindle’s “jump the shark” moment."
Lisa G,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to love my kindle whitepaper and I do love having the convenience of having all my books in a small place and able to carry it with me everywhere. That's when the pages starting turning all by themselves, pages flipping while I was reading, I contacted Amazon, and since my kindle was only about 8 weeks old they said after I complained I wanted a new one, they said they would send a brand new one, ""make an exception for me"" but I received a refurb...how stupid do you thinI am...the label said refurbished. I was disappointed but was in a middle of a great novel..i will update this after I see if this one lasts..I hope so..like I said..I want to love this kindle."
Rachel Paskett,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have loved my kindle! It’s really nice that it’s waterproof, I’ve enjoyed reading in the tub and at the beach. Also, I love how it almost feels like reading an actual book because of the way the screen looks. Also, being able to send yourself PDFs or ebooks through email and have them end up on your kindle is awesome. Another really convenient feature is how light it is. It’s not heavy carrying it around or holding it while reading, even with one hand. Finally, the battery life is amazing! It has lasted me for 2 weeks of heavy use on a charge, and even longer under light use.
The only complaints I have are the following:
Sometimes the touch screen is a little weird, like it won’t sense that I’m swiping and just think I’m tapping, which can change behavior. Also, it tends to just automatically do software updates without asking first. I’ve had problems with this where I literally got in the car, brought my kindle so I could read during the trip, and then it decided that that moment would be a great one to update. Other than that, the kindle is really convenient and great to use!"
Evan Lampman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is definitely my favorite Amazon purchase of all time. The Kindle is perfect for reading any time of day or night and the adjustability of font size and brightness are great controls to have. However, the best part of the Kindle is never having to worry about what book I'm reading right now because my Kindle has all of my books and the places I stopped reading them! That might not sound cool to people who don't read a lot of books. For those people: THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR YOU!!!! You don't deserve this amazing technology if you can't appreciate it. Go back to the stone age you monumental fool."
P. Moran,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had 4 Kindles starting with the first ever offered. I've loved them all. My original finally isn't what it used to be. I ordered a Paperwhite Kindle several years ago and loved the features...i.e. backlighting. Somehow I lost the second Kindle had bought and since I like having two current and working models I ordered the newest Paperwhite. It's working like a charm.
ko103576,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Some of the reviews here put me off of making this purchase, but the sale price was too good to pass up and I have missed my Kindle touch since I broke it. This is an excellent replacement, and I haven’t had any issues with the “pin hole” lights that others have seen thus far. It’s possible I’m not using it as much as others did before seeing them, but I’ve given it several weeks if not a month before submitting this review.

It’s a great upgrade to the touch, which was several years ago so that’s to be expected. The backlight works as much as it needs to (if not, you can crank up the brightness, I’m keeping it decently low to conserve battery), and barring using it at full backlight the battery life is fantastic. I haven’t charged mine since receiving it (I will need to soon obviously). I also don’t use Bluetooth so that could be something others run into that have complained about battery life. I do wish they’d only offer Bluetooth in the more expensive model to drive the price of this one lower, but maybe this is something I’ll make use of in the future.

Overall, I just wanted to share my thoughts in contrast with some of the complaints I saw that held me off somewhat until I decided that my satisfaction with my original Kindle outweighed any complaints and went for it."
R. Christenson / Lunamation,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Apparently there is no way to import collections from my old kindle to this new one, though there used to be a way. I spent many many hours organizing over 2,000 books into 16 collections (sci-fi, mystery, history, etc..) Many of these books don't have an author name or other information than the title unless you open them to look, so it's a painstaking task. Now I simply want to copy that work to my new kindle, and their customer service doesn't know how."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I do want to say that I have enjoyed the actual experience of reading on the device. However, I have used the device very infrequently, likely less than 20 hours of active usage in total over the span of a year. After not using the kindle in probably a few months and finding the device out of battery, I tried to charge it overnight and had no luck.

After a few more nights of tinkering (different wall chargers, micro usb cables, soft-resetting the device) and attempting to charge the device, I've come to the conclusion I'm not gonna get this to charge again.

As a result, I'm left with a dead Kindle that I barely got to use. Surely this doesn't happen to everyone, but my takeaway is that this sort of issue COULD happen to anyone without warning, regardless of frequency of usage of the device, or how well you take care of it.

If this does happen then hopefully your device is under warranty, because it seems that otherwise all you will receive is a 15% discount code for a new Kindle from Amazon support at best. And I'm very hesitant to purchase a new device given this experience. What guarantee is there that this issue will not happen again without warning?"
maria gordon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use it just for reading. I love the way u can adjust the print size and light, it doesn’t do the amber light, but the light is perfect! It can adjust from high to low. Perfect to handle. I can really go a whole week without charging it n I only charge it because all of the rain we r getting don’t want to lose my battery."
H. Lapo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had several Kindles over the years, including the Voyager which this device replaces. Is this version ""better"" than previous versions? Nah...but it's certainly no worse either. Fact is, in regular use there is little to differentiate this from it's predecessors unless you use Audible (which I don't). Beyond that, it looks and functions pretty much the same as before. Probably wouldn't pay full price for this, but if you can catch a sale or special promotion I'd recommend it."
Alan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchase this newest generation Kindle Paperwhite, mostly because I like to have the most recent up-to-date gadgets. It is an excellent ereader for Kindle books. However, I found that it performed almost identically to my old Kindle Paperwhite that was several years old. Although it's a nice device, I don't think there's a compelling reason to upgrade unless you will use the bluetooth audio connection, which the older generation Paperwhites don't have."
Aldo Adamo,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When I bought this product, I expected an improvement over my previous Kindle Paperwhite, which I was absolutely delighted with.

For the most part, this version works well, except for one thing: THE BATTERY IS AWFUL. Leave it unused for a week and the battery will be drained. Use it for an afternoon and it will use up a third of the battery. It is absolute disgraceful.

And it has only gotten worse as time has gone by, to the point that I feel compelled to write this review now to warn people about it."
S. Morris,4.0 out of 5 stars,I'm not convinced that this is much better than my old Kindle. I bought it because it is supposedly waterproof. I haven't tested that yet. It has more storage again supposedly twice what my old one did but tech companies count differently from ordinary people and either the amount of storage in my old kindle is wrong or my new one is wrong. This boots slower and is less responsive than the old one but I seem to have fewer errors in random location jumping. I guess the paper white is worth the upgrade but not by a lot.
Michelle E. Nelson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle product. I was using my phone but the battery couldn't keep up so I made the plunge and got a Kindle Paperwhite. I love how light it is so it doesn't hurt my hand. It is fairly easy, even for an ""old"" person like me, to navigate and buy or download books. I find the light is perfect for reading in any condition. My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is the ad that is constantly on the screen when turned off. That can't be good for the screen in the long run. Even a screen saver of some kind would be better. Overall, not bad for what it is."
Kevin E.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ended up being a perfect Valentine's day present. My wife has not been able to put it down. She compliments it and its ease of use daily. I haven't heard her complain about her eyes hurting since she started using it and I can for-see a few years of use out of it, for sure. I can mention that it is a little ""slow"". Sluggish, if you will. But, it is not meant to be a tablet. It is a digital book. And for that use, it is perfect."
francis r. tyburski,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So this is Kindle 6...second floor knewel post...just old...lost...and previously I packed boxes of books for my wife to take to the assisted living library because our library (two walls of shelves were overflowing.
E book, not me! I received my first as a gift....yeah, not so shure...fall down stairs and bust up quads...surgery...kindle...any book I want without walking or driving?
So this new Kindle is ""clean""... Really pleasant look of the page..nice lighting...pleasant fonts. I like it like a book...(I have found myself reading the New Yorker and touching the margin to turn the page!!!
I really like and feel comfortable with this rendition...enjoy."
Judy Dew,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My battery stopped holding it's charge so I looked online and saw that a new paperwhite version was being released. I ordered it before the Nov release. I traded in a couple of older kindles to reduce the price. The new kindle's battery lasts about a week when my older paperwhite lasted for two. It's supposed to be better. I chatted with amazon and they had me reset it and recharge it. That didn't improve performance. I chatted with amazon again. They agreed that my performance was not as good as expected. I factory reset and made sure I had the most recent version of the software. There appears to be no improvement in performance. I was told me that I had to send my Kindle to them before I received a replacement and my replacement would be my repaired Kindle or a refurbished Kindle. What? I paid money for a new working kindle but I didn't get one and they won't replace my not working Kindle with a new one? Saw in the reviews that someone got a replacement easily but having asked, I was told no. The only way I can get a new kindle is to return this one by Jan 31 and order a new one. I've loved all my kindles. I've worn out two. I don't understand why replacing my faulty paperwhite with a new one is a problem. I'm not happy with this purchase and never expected poor customer service. On a different subject, there was a recent update that made all the icons across the top menu smaller. I hate that. As mentioned in other reviews, when I try to read when I exercise the kindle keeps turning off."
Gerri A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased May 2019 and have waited for almost 30 days to post a review.
The screen is glare free. Pages turn easily. The size is very nice and is comfortable to hold. Charged the Kindle to 90% on the first day and have not recharged it since. It is used everyday.
I have no experience with moisture so far. Overall very happy with this Kindle."
Kim Perrino,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my kindle, the last kindle lasted only 14 month I changed the battery and it still doesn’t work. The only thing I don’t like wasn’t fixed with the newer model, the charging cord is wobbly, I tried several that finally didn’t wiggle, my new cable already broke and the metal inside the kindle where you plug in already bent, I pushed it back and hope it stays there. Kinda upset about this as they are not cheap."
BGA,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Burned out after about five months. We’ve been charging it about once or twice a week, and a few weeks ago we connected it only to see a disconnect graphic on the screen. Checked everything including the charger and all’s fine except this thing doesn’t want to take charge. Emailed the customer svc and was replied that I need to either chat or call in to return, and I haven’t had a chance to do that. They will replace since still under warrantee but I am not happy about the hassle and expected higher quality from amazon."
trinis81,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle PaperWhite. I have purchased the Kindle Fire in the past.
Pros:
-The PaperWhite is small and compact.
Cons:
-Battery life is not as long as advertised. At the most, maybe 8-10 hours.
-Swiping is very difficult on this product. Can barely move any of the pages forward, sometimes the pages go backward when swiping left. Very annoying.
-Same with the swiping, getting to the homepage is very difficult. I have to touch the screen several times before the menu bar pops up
-Library display is a crap shoot.

Would not recommend and will NOT purchase again."
Melissa Mule,3.0 out of 5 stars,This kindle is nice for reading in sun or in a dark room but it’s glitchy in that an accidental soft screen touch can fast forward many pages or forward toc the end and other weird things. Don’t plan on shopping for kindle books from this and have your library well organized because moving through screens of titles is not easy to do- it’s very slow and too easy to accidentally open and start downloading a title unintentionally. I’m frankly shocked that this is the quality of product sold in 2019.
James B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had some misgivings about buying this because of the battery life complaints, but I have not had any problems, and I love the higher screen resolution vs. my previous paperwhite. The user interface is a bit different but still very easy to use, and the ads are not intrusive. Being waterproof was certainly a plus when I dropped it somewhere unfortunate. No harm! I carry batteries with me but I have not needed them so far. My old version had a cracked screen and a dead battery. It was time, and this model is great."
Nicole,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love love love. So happy with the updated features. Brightness selection is greater, text is finer and sharper and more font options. It’s faster and smoother and the flush screen feels great in my hands. I upgraded from a model I bought in 2014 so my experience is over a number of model upgrades. I love not worrying about water near it, especially since I take this backpacking with me. Would recommend to voracious readers! I appreciate the feature (which I think is standard on kindles) that allows me to open my kindle app on my break at work and pick up where I left off before I fell asleep the night before."
Theresa,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really do like this one but my old one holds its charge longer. It is not a deal breaker since I can easily recharge but it is a point to consider. I did notice that if I turn on the airplane it seems to last a little longer. I read A LOT so the kindle is on for hours each day. Also I have macular degeneration so I keep my font size higher and my light high too. All of that likely contributes to the battery loss. My husband is happy with my older paperwhite so not a chance am I am getting it back. I would definitely buy this again
Charlotte M.,1.0 out of 5 stars,i HAVE VERY LOW VISION AND IT SAID LISTENING TO AUDIO BOOKS WAS EASY. iT IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE HAVE TO CONNECT TO BLUETOOTH EVERY TIME AND i CANNOT SEE TO GO THRU ALL THE STEPS
Thomas F. Kravec,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not like the (much) smaller screen since it feels like I have to turn a page constantly, even with smaller print chosen. So far, the battery seems to charge ok and stays charged. It's hard to judge since I had to purchase this reader because the battery ran down on the old one. I imagine that the small screen would be easier to travel with, but I don't care for it. Also, it isn't 'instant-on"" and I really miss that feature. I will get used to it but I don't think it's an upgrade in any way."
MaineFlyersFan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everyone needs a Kindle Paperwhite in their life. Seriously. If you are a reader, you are making a huge mistake not having one.
This newest generation is the best one yet. I have a 2nd generation which I still use to this day and now this new model. I love them both.
I especially love the new features including the brighter , crisper screen and especially the water resistance.
Seriously, if you are a reader stop hesitating and just buy one. You will not regret it."
CourtneyD,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I think the new Paperwhite is great! I upgraded from my 1st gen paperwhite due to the slowness/delay in just about everything. I am very happy with the upgrade so far. I did see some comments about battery life so I’m watching that and can’t comment about it, I’ve only had mine for two days. But is it really that bad when you can charge it overnight and and not have to worry about it for another week?
I also read comments about being waterproof. Now I’m not going to go swimming or take a shower with my kindle but it’s comforting to know that a little bit of water won’t hurt/ruin it.
Another topic I’d like to cover is the audible. It think it’s super cool that I can listen to a book wirelessly from my kindle. I’m not one to do so often but since it is now an option for me, I think I just might try it out. I’d rather waste my kindle battery than waste my phone battery. That’s just me though.

I’m sure as time goes on I’ll find things to adjust to but that’s what it is, an adjustment. Just because it’s a little bit different than what I’m used to doesn’t mean it’s a bad product. I am very happy with the switch."
anon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First, the positives: I love having a Kindle Paperwhite--being able to cart hundreds of books around in my purse and to read at night without turning on a light. I would have given my first Paperwhite five stars, no question. The only reason I considered a trade-in/upgrade was that I had used my original Paperwhite heavily for over four years and didn't want it to go out on me unexpectedly, since I do use it frequently. No signs of it failing, but . . . .

I also have to give full credit for a smooth process in the trade-in process. I received a 25% credit off the sale price toward the purchase of a new Kindle and gift card credit for the trade-in (contingent on the trade-in being shipped and in the reported condition) at the time I ordered the new Paperwhite and thus was able to receive my new Paperwhite before sending off the old one so that I didn't have to go a day without my Kindle. I received a pre-paid label to ship my first Paperwhite in at no expense to me. The trade-in was processed quickly and fairly. Great service there.

So, why the three stars? Well, my new Paperwhite is still a nice product, but it is actually inferior to my original in several ways and thus is a complete failure as an upgrade. It presumably is waterproof, which would be nice if I ever spilled a glass of water around it or some such thing. However, it seems to have a shorter battery life rather than the longer one I'd been led to believe it would. I used to have to charge the old one about every three weeks; this one goes through 10-12% battery charge per day. The old one took maybe a second to wake up; this one can take up to five seconds. The old one would ""wake up"" at the light intensity I had set for reading (fairly low, so that I can read at night if I wake up and can't get back to sleep, without waking my spouse); this one comes on BRIGHT--to the point of waking my spouse from sleep, which had never happened with the old one and which limits my middle-of-the-night reading. I'm still using my Paperwhite regularly and am glad to have it, but I wish I had just stuck with what I had until I saw signs of trouble with the original unit."
M D,2.0 out of 5 stars,"March 2020 update
STILL really disappointed that Amazon is not supporting immersion reading on the Kindle Paperwhite. Please have some of your app developers work on this to enable it for all the kids who are now at home due to COVID-19. You have the technology. Kids should not have to read on an Android or iPad device just to be able to see the pictures in the book while listening to a story with Audible, and they ought to be able to support learning to read by reading along. PLEASE fix this oversight Amazon! This is a great thing for your SW team to do while CA is under shelter-in-place. Thank you!

---------
Very disappointed that you can't listen to Audible and read the page at the same time. I understood that this didn't support ""immersive reading"" with word-by-word highlighting of the text, but it wasn't clear that when listening, you can't choose to see the text at all. I wanted this for my daughter with dyslexia, so that she could read and listen, and I didn't want her to have to read on an LCD device, or be tempted by all the other apps available on those devices. Amazon is missing the boat on this. Please provide a software upgrade to enable simultaneous reading and listening. Other features are all fine, but this was my primary reason to upgrade."
victorianlady,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have resisted a kindle for years, instead choosing to read books (I'm old fashioned). Nonetheless, when I wanted to read a particularly scarce story, my mom loaned me her Kindle. I was hooked! Granted, I still love to read actual books but I am addicted to the Kindle! The ability to enlarge the font, adjust the light for eye comfort, and the availability of so many books in one place is amazing! I was gifted mine for Christmas and have been using it daily!"
Ashley H,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle so I don’t have anything to compare it to. I do like the built-in light, but wish it was a bit ‘warmer’ when I’m reading in the dark at night.
The touchscreen is not as sensitive like our phones so it took me a minute to get used to that. The Kindle also seems to lag a bit whenever I select an option but maybe this app was similar to other Kindles?
The battery life is fantastic. So far, I love to use this and can’t wait to take it on vacation with me."
CTofCT,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am new to having a Kindle. For many years I relied on my iPad and struggled with the battery life and light reflection. The Kindle is beyond wonderful in both aspects. I took it on a work trip and spent a 6 hour flight reading and never had the fear of needing to charge. I put mine in a case and even with a case it is incredibly light weight. This was a great investment.

I didn't give it a full 5 star rating as sometimes I will flip pages or flip through the home page and it will blink the inverse to black/white for a second. This isn't major, but it isn't a flawless transition."
sjk324,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this to replace the previous generation kindle that I lost while traveling. I wasn’t thrilled that this new kindle is now even smaller than the last version (easier to lose!) I haven’t really rested the waterproof feature, but I’m guessing that’s why the screen is not as sensitive as my old kindle. Sometimes I have to tap it multiple times to turn a page, which is a little annoying. The new sleep mode does seem to improve battery life. With the sleep mode and keeping it in airplane mode, I usually only charge 1x a month while reading several hours a day."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace my no- backlight kindle because I use audible and wanted the extra storage. My eyes are glare sensitive and I thought I would just have the backlight set to off, but I find that it's quite comfortable to read with the colors inverted (white text, black background) and the back light just under the middle brightness setting, regardless of the ambient light around me.

The battery life is great, too. I've had a couple back to back marathon reading days in with it and found 12 hours I'd active use took me down between 40 and 50% of the battery. I haven't given it a chance to see how long it holds a charge, and discovering that I can use it with the Calibre software to side load the web serials I like to stay up with, I doubt it will get that chance."
Janet N.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned a kindle ever since they came on the market. I love my original, but due to updates, it is no longer supported so I bought this new one. Imagine my surprise when I was on vacation and could not download a new book because there was no internet. When I was at the resort, I tried to access the internet, but the Kindle would not accept the signin for that internet. I was stuck with no book to read. My original Kindle could access books no matter where I was, why can’t the new ones have this capability? Very disappointed in the new one."
FauxReal,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Functionally I don't see much difference between this and the older Papewhite model. However, the black frame around the ""page"" screen on the new model is different. On the old model it has a matte finish and I never saw a fingerprint. On this model its shiny and I see smudges wherever I touch it.

Was it worth an upgrade? Not really. But I got it on sale with a trade-in of a very old Kindle (the model without a light).

I'll probably continue to use my older Paperwhite and use this new model as a backup."
GrandmaG,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately I discarded the box or I would have returned this piece of junk. I am a usually a very happy and heavy prime user and am shocked and surprised by product and service, connected with this paperwhite 10th generation...The settings are obscure ( ie: landscape/portrait), and the print clarity and evenness is poor. I unfortunately discarded the packaging, but tried to return it anyway. The call to Amazon is immediately sent to kindle and they try to convince you that your eyes are deceiving you, and will not do a return. I have a fire hd, and love it...thought this might be easier on my eyes as I read a lot. After close to $200, I am saddled with something I have used twice..wish I could give negative stars...boo to Amazon on product quality and service."
Lady Lyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love to pre screen my books before I buy them for my home collection for work and I use this combined with the kindle unlimited offer and can research books and if I really like I go pick up at my local book store. I normally don't read on the kindle further then finding the book I want but have quit often started grabbing it when the husband wants to go fishing or the kids need a ride to the mall. I really enjoy the size and it fits in my purse very nicely with the cover I purchased it stays nice and safe and I barley notice the added weight. Over all I def would suggest to buy. if you read a lot on these types of devices and have the extra cash for the upgraded model; try that out at a best buy near you. the screen looks very nice. Oasis its called.... the Rose Gold Color is HOT!!!!!
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Kindle stopped holding a charge less than a year after I bought it. I had bought a cheaper version, so when I replaced it I bought what I hoped and expected to be better -- it was specifically billed as having a long charge life -- which cost about twice as much as the first. Its battery died in 3 months flat. I have a number of unread books on it and now I'm afraid to buy another one -- I can't afford to buy two or three a year, and all the books as well. I know many people whose Kindles have held up for years, but my first two died so early that I don't trust them. I looked on user forums and tried every single suggestion to get them to work, but neither of the two would hold a charge. The new one lasted just beyond the return period, naturally, and I seem to be out the full price. So now I'm stuck with a dead Kindle plus unread/unreadable books. This may not happen to you, but I have no idea what to do next myself."
Marie Redman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the older model from 2013 and my daughter decided to upgrade and give me the new Kindle Paperwhite. I like the lighter weight, longer battery, etc. but I do not like the advertising of other books on the screen when I turn it on. I never thought that I would change from a book to this type of device. I can bring this anywhere, just pop it into my bag and not have to carry a bulky book."
debbie700,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the first Kindle I have owned. I love the Paperwhite as it is so easy to read and my eyes don't bother me like when using a tablet. I have enjoyed reading numerous books since I purchased this. So much easier to handle than a book. And easy to carry with me. Battery lasts a long time. Easy and fast downloading of books.
M.R.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I discovered that this version of the PaperWhite does not accept many of the Kindle books I have purchased, previously. I went back to my older Kindle (which has uneven light distribution and is not water resistant) because it DOES accept those books. I think that Amazon needs to be more up-front and honest about this major flaw, so that customers can be informed prior to purchase! Not a real Prime Day bargain, after all. I was going to trade in my old Kindle, but now, will just keep it, because of this deficiency in the new product."
Genevieve,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really enjoying this product. The screen is just bright enough and the font is adjustable. There are plenty of options which I like. I get all my books online, free, from the California public library system. If I really want to read a book that's wait listed, I'll buy it on Amazon.

Transferring books to the Kindle is a snap. The nook I had was much more complicated and every time I plugged it in to my chromebook the thing would shut down."
Carol Bookworm,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used paperwhites for years. I thought by upgrading to this model that I'd have something better, but it is an UTTER piece of junk that has all kind of issues with wifi connection. My old paperwhite connected through my normal home wifi this one doesn't even detect the network. I got it to connect through my iPhone once, a few months ago, but now it can't find that, either. Sometimes at random coffee shops I'm able to download my books. Amazon's documentation is no help. So regret this purchase."
Kayla,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this kindle. It’s easy to use, and everything I hoped it would be in regards to back light and paper, non glare feel. The touch screen is very slow which can be frustrating at times, but that really doesn’t happen often because the kindles primary focus is reading books, and the page turning is not an issue. If you’re looking for a kindle to only read books on, back light, no glare, long battery life, this is your kindle. If you want internet, games, or anything more than books I’d Look for other options.
Long story short I love my kindle."
Colorado gal,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had misgivings on purchasing this based on reviews of touchy power button, weird flickering light from the bottom of the page.

Happy to say I’ve had NONE of those issues. I’ve used this for about a month now. Great battery life. I like that it is the size of a paperback but much slimmer. It feels good in my hands. And ability to adjust the brightness for varying light conditions is wonderful. No glare on the screen.

Don’t hesitate, I’ve been very pleased."
Kindle Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Why this product couldn't be set up the same as the Kindle apps is beyond me. It is difficult to get through screens without it arbitrarily opening a book :( When you have hundreds of books , this is a PITA. Collections do not sync from Amazon to the Kindle - they sync up but not down so you have to add EACH book to the proper collection when you download it. Again, when you have hundreds of books this is a PITA.

Yes it works great for reading outdoors and that is the best I can say about it."
MKS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new Kindle Paperwhite. I upgraded from my Gen 2 Kindle and the difference is amazing! It's very easy to use, battery life is great (just make sure you have it in airplane mode), it's very light weight. I love that it marks which books you've read. The touchscreen makes it extremely easy to use. There are so many improvements over my old Kindle that I tend to use it more than I had been using my old one. I highly recommend this Kindle Paperwhite."
RDB,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My voyage died and I replaced it with the paperwhite. The paperwhite is slower to respond to touches. Each iteration of the software makes it harder to configure and use (why can't I configure my menu?. The on/off switch is on the bottom which is a leap backward (interior is probably the old design which put the button there) so when I set it down it turns off. Why do they call this an improvement?

As soon as the new voyage comes out I plan no discard this one-- was that Amazon's plan all along?"
Erin Q,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Paperwhite, it feels a lot closer to reading a book than reading on my phone. I feel like my eyes don’t get as tired as they did using my phone and it’s easier to hold/prop in a comfortable position. I love the options for settings and the easy portability. The convenience already has me reading more than I had been. The only downside I have found is that it’s is slow operation when changing settings or looking through my library, but that doesn’t affect the reading and so it’s a minor inconvenience."
Abbey E. Brooks,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This new kindle is very lightweight and the screen is nice. However, I am extremely disappointed that there is no text to talk feature, like the less expensive kindle fire has. I bought the $20 audio accessory, but it still does not work with every kindle book, so far I can only make it work with audio books. Very disappointed, as the text to talk was my favorite feature of the kindle fire."
Steven Wong,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for the Bluetooth audio feature and the waterproof case, but after using it for a week I find myself using it much more than the previous gen paperwhite.

The overall build quality is much higher. Like they got a different designer / manufacturer to make this one. The seams are smoother, the plug looks as clean as a smartphone’s.

It’s only an oz or two lighter, but feels much better in my hand.

The flush screen makes a huge difference from the thick bevel of the last one. It lets me change the pages while holding the device with just one hand.

It’s not as fast to wake as the last gen, and it did freeze once already, so it’s not perfect. But I upgraded on Prime Day so I got a fantastic deal, $32 only with the trade in."
Nancy Beyer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to upgrade because my previous Paperwhite Kindle stopped working. The battery charge doesn't last as long on this one, despite the fact that my active content (my sudoku game) no longer works, which had been the biggest drain on the previous one. I miss my very first kindle, with whispernet delivery, active content, and a battery that lasted over a week. I think I'm happy about the additional storage capacity... but I never maxed out the old one, although I read at least 2 -3 books a week. The browsing gets cumbersome when there are a lot of books in your library. I don't think that recently accessed collections should be sorted along with the individual books by date."
d,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a learning curve as it has subtle differences. My old paper white was 8 years old and stopped holding charge, until I bought this one. So I have two! Ha!

This is a touch smaller and lighter. Home page different. It hides the books you have read, which if you borrowed from library, and forgot title, you need to find it on new one to return.
Otherwise bout the same.
I like it and hope it lasts as long as old one. (The old charging cord was longer)."
cindy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had been reluctant to purchase a new Kindle as I had gotten used to using my iPad and the Kindle app... but Amazon had a sale and a trade in plan...so I gave it a go.
I love the built in light ( I keep it at full brightness because I am used to iPad), it is not as bright as iPad, but plenty enough to read in the dark.
It is faster with page turns than the old Kindle too
I bought my old Kindle 8 years ago so this is quite an improvement"
Monica,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this new kindle. I can read in bed without disturbing my husband. I can see the pages in the sunlight. I can read it in the hot tub because it can get wet. It is also small enough and light weight I hardly notice it in my purse when traveling. I love it!
Sarah Bridges,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new kindle paperwhite and the kindle unlimited subscription is great as well! With the kindle unlimited I have found several great books to read for free. As for the kindle itself, I love how you can adjust the lighting on it. When I'm laying In bed at night and want to read the light isnt harsh and doesnt disturb my husband as he sleeps. When I read outside the sun doesnt reflect off the screen at all. The battery life is great, my kindle is going on 2 weeks with daily use without it needing to be charged. It's also so portable for trips. The only con that I have found thus far would be that the touch screen is slow to react and not very accurate. When I go to highlight a word or sentence sometimes its reaction time is so slow that I end up trying again by the time it works. Also when I'm trying to highlight a word or sentence by holding my finger down on the word, it sometimes will start to highlight a sentence or two above where my finger actually is. Which can get kinda frustrating, especially since modern electronics are very instant in reacting to touch and are very accurate. Other than that, no complaints! And highly recommend."
Karen Davis,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am extremely disappointed. I just received the FOURTH! replacement device for the new kindle I bought before Christmas and that was barely at the end of February. All 4 have done the same thing. If I don’t toggle airplane mode on/off or sync or go to store every couple of days, it goes into a stasis. The icon makes it appear that airplane mode is off but will not toggle airplane on/off, sync or go to store. I have to restart the device to get it to work again. Each time I call amazon kindle support they make a note and send me another one that does the same thing!!"
DRWF,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a Xmas present from my kids to replace the one they gave me in 2012--I'm a happy Grandma! The new device was easy for me to set up, and I had no problem downloading my library from the previous device. I really like the touchscreen capacity, and, when kept in sleep mode between reading sessions, the battery lasts a long time. The lighting is also easy on the eyes. Still figuring out the bluetooth connection--guess I'd better call a grandkid!"
Carola,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I left my 2017 version Kindle on a plane to Iceland last month and needed a new one as soon as I got home. I was so disappointed to see that the Paperwhite I had before is no longer available, but there is a new one almost twice as expensive and 1/3 smaller. Total bummer. It works wonderfully of course, but what a business model..... I will charge you double and give you less. And since you need it, you will buy it. The product works wonderfully."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The reader is pretty good overall. The only minor complaint is that the on/off button is too sensitive. Touching it accidentally turns off the device. Also, I am not sure whether the higher resolution is worth it. We have a second, lower resolution kindle e-reader (167ppi). I compared some figures on the Paperwhite (300ppi) and on the regular one side-by-side, and could not see a difference even when the figures are magnified."
Lovetoread,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Getting used to the sensitivity of the touch screen to turn pages, etc has been a challenge. If I don't hit it just right I get all kinds of options that I have to back out of. I personally liked the button on the side better.

Also, my entire library downloaded. I had to go to the cloud and clean up (mark ""read"") the books I had already read and deleted off my old device.

Screen is crisp and clear, light and battery work great."
ms. m,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got a new Kindle to replace my 6 year old one that started to get lines in the display. There’s not an enormous difference, but the type is a bit crisper. The interface is still slow (which is fine). My big issue is the light is SO BRIGHT. Even at the lowest setting, it is many times brighter than the older kindle, which makes it unusable at night when I’m trying not to wake my partner. This can be fixed with a firmware update, so fingers crossed."
"Avid Reader, N.Andover, MA",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very happy with my new Kindle (2nd Paperwhite owned). Smaller and weighs less than my previous model, hopefully I'll never find out if it's actually water proof! Battery life seams about the same as my last version. The main negative is every once in awhile during use it puts itself to ""sleep"" and I have to ""wake it up"". That is annoying. All in all, happy with the purchase, prices have become very reasonable and with the Book Bub app (free books) it's like having your own personal library right at your finger tips."
JOYCE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not like the paperwhite. It is not user friendly, it has no instructions except on the kindle to read while you are trying to follow thru on instructions. I loved my old Kindle and wish it could be fixed. It was simple and straight forward without all the bells and whistles and of course is now obsolete. I have talked with customer service, they are very nice but cannot give me what I want and that is written instructions via email or snail mail.All the wonderfully thought out improvements are not for everyone , keep some models simple because that's what a lot of us want and are willing to pay for."
generic customer1,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love to pick up the paper white & slip it into my pocket & take it with me when I go someplace. The battery lasts long; fits into my hand for easy reading in most any light. It's quite sturdy as I dropped it on the floor once & it didn't suffer any damage. I'm now thinking of getting a cover for kit. My only small irritant is the on/off button; it's located n the bottom & sometimes while holding it I'll bump the button & it'll turn off. Otherwise I'm quite happy with the kindle paper white.
Teresa K. Collins,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to trade in my older Kindle Oasis for a new Paperwhite kindle because it had the waterproof feature. I shipped my old kindle (I still had the original box and packed paper around this in a larger box. The only thing wrong with it was the charging cover was frayed on the edge. When they received my kindle they said the screen had cracks and it would not charge. I read this kindle up until I packed it up to send. It charged fine and had no cracks. I would have kept it if I had known I would only get $5 instead of the $60 they offered. I will never trade anything in again, that was a ripoff. I do love my new kindle, charge time is really good."
Jen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my Kindle Paperwhite for about 2.5 months; no complaints. I wasn't sure if I would like ebooks as I am used to a paperback. What the best features are...
*no glare
*long battery life
*easy download to my library
*tons of books on kindle unlimited for free!!!
*some water resistance... need for the pool
I need to get a cover, otherwise it will turn on easily. That is really the only issue I have with it. But I would definitely purchase again!"
Cory,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This kindle was a great update to the previous generation. The new style lighting is much more evenly distributed and makes the screen look that much more crisp. The screen is now level with the bezel and makes it feel better in your hand, easier on the eyes, and a better experience turning pages. Great price. Nice and light. A joy to use!

The only thing I don’t like is it’s a little more shiny then the previous generation. The matte finish was preferred."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have owned a Paperwhite for years. It did its job and now is doing it for my son. I like my new more recent Kindle Paperwhite because it is lighter and does not have a gray shadow towards the bottom of the page and I do not have to worry about it getting wet. Battery Life is another story. I do not read for just a half-hour a day and so it does not last for weeks. It does, however, last for days which is not a problem but it is a misstatement in advertising."
DaHand,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Everytime I click on a new item, the screen flashes and inverts black and white. I read elsewhere that you just have to ""accept this"" but my previous kindle was NOT this way. I think there is something wrong with this one. The screen should not flash, it should just load. I may have to send this back. Also, this is not color, so the Kindle Store book covers are not in color, despite wifi. It is lightweight, small (like i wanted) and I have a nice cover. Also, the instructions printed are VERY limited, you have to go to the kindle store and get the 110+ page manual. Clicking through each page with a flash is a problem. I think this one is defective."
Susan H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle Paperwhite. I loved the one that preceded this one, that I got in 2014--I did not want to replace it I loved it so much but the screen cracked and I had to. The new Kindle Paperwhite is even better. It holds more books and the light in the dark is not so glaring. The battery holds its power for days and days. i would not want to switch to a tablet--the battery life, storage space, and light make it superior to any tablet for reading out there. I am just sorry our library decided to pick and e reader company that does not support the kindle paperwhite. It is the perfect e reader in every way"
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so impressed with the new Kindle Paperwhite. First of all, it's very light to hold and perfect size for my hand. Conventional books are too heavy for me. I wear polarized sunglasses and was thrilled when I saw the Paperwhite did not become distorted as I read sitting on the beach. Perfect in every way for my needs!"
T. Ben,5.0 out of 5 stars,I always get Kindle readers only. Not interested in using hand held unit for real computer use. I have a laptop for that. What I want is a reader that has long battery life and a built in light. I have had 2 Kindle e-readers that I have loved but have had to use an external light for reading at night or in low light circumstances. This paperwhite with light is great and the waterproof is a plus for a klutz like me. Always get screen protection and a cover for protection too.
Network Guy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I honestly would give this a 5 star review if it weren't for where they placed the power button.. I like to hold it with one hand, and with the placement of the power button on the bottom I continually turn it off.. Why on earth would you put that on the bottom, and not at the top out of the way?! Extremely annoying.

Battery life wasn't quite what i expected, but if you turn off wireless you get there.. I just find it annoying to turn wireless on and off.."
T. E. Wolfe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I enjoyed my previous Kindle very much. I was very unhappy when the old one stopped working. I took advantage of Amazon's trade-in opportunity, and I could not be happier. This new Kindle is faster, the back-lighting helps me read and it allows me to read when all the other lights in the house are off. Battery life has been every bit a good as what it was in my older model and with this new one, there are more options with the menus than I ever had before. I am 100% satisfied and I will bet you will be too."
Jeff,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this Paperwhite to replace my old ""key pad"" style that has served me well but I was attracted to the water resistance of this one. I don't see any real advantage of the Paperwhite from a clarity standpoint as my old kindle was very paper-like both indoors and in the sun. There is definitely the advantage of being able to read in low light areas. Page turning sometimes advances multiple pages with one tap and I have to backtrack to where I was. It takes some getting used to the touch screen and I've found myself touching the screen by accident and turning pages or opening settings etc. For this reason I rated it a 4 instead of a 5"
Todd R.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The screen is very small; you can change the font size, but that makes it awkward. The brightness has to be almost at 100% or else it's hard to see; this drains the battery much faster than expected. There is an annoying flickering (normal) each time you change screens. The black/white coloring makes you agitated quickly. You have to pay $20 to get rid of 'special offers'. I bought this used; it functions great but due to the above, I don't like it."
Jon B,1.0 out of 5 stars,"1) screen area is small
2) Looks like previous generation, nothing attractive visually
3) waterproof? Who knows? The charge port is open to the elements, hmmmmm!
4) you can search on line and find a 8 inch + screen that does a lot more, oh, and its color, for $129. Much better deal.
5) this poor cocept horse has been flogged often enough. Come up with something that is more defined.
6) my dinner plate edge is a little bigger than thus things edge.. Maybe that's what the waterproof is for....."
tech mom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for reading downloaded library books. It is a lot easier to download them to a kindle than a nook. (I have both now.) the kindle is user friendly and easy to use. I haven’t tested the waterproof yet but I am sure eventually it will happen because I read when soaking in the tub. Picture quality and resolution is good, not bad on the eyes. Pairs with EarPods easily. Love the audiobook feature and text reading feature. Worth the money."
C.Stastny Books,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My new kindle is sleek and sweet. Just flat, no edges anymore. Love everything about it. My only drawback is the power button on the bottom is very touchy and goes on and off easily, and when I prop it up on my spin bike's book holder, it turns off because the button touches the bottom of the holder. I have to turn it slightly so the power switch doesn't touch the bottom of the holder. That's my only hangup. Otherwise, I'm quite pleased with it."
Joe Jasper,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been reading ebooks with my phone or my rather heavy tablet. Using this Kindle is easier, lighter and very clear. I like the variability of font size and the night mode of white type on black and the backlight for bedtime. Also, I don’t have to worry about damage when reading while in the tub, beach or poolside. I haven’t mastered connecting to my public library directly from this device, so I first load books on other devices to be read in Kindle, no problem."
Jian Lin,3.0 out of 5 stars,I traded in my 7th generation kindle for the current one. The new device is slightly easier to hold but also feels flimsier. The screen seems to be dimmer in comparison to the older model. Overall I’d consider it a lateral upgrade to my old device.
Red XIII,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife is an avid reader. I, not so much. But now with the Kindle Paperwhite, it's super easy to get lost in a book wherever you are without having to jump over to library to return or renew. I wear glasses but don't get eye strain from this, even at night. Try this....we use Overdrive app from our local library to send books straight to the Kindle. Then they expire after 21 days. That along with Prime books give us an amazing selection! I'm never at a lost for new stuff to read, even if it takes me longer to do so!"
RJS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since receiving my Kindle Paperwhite I have noticed a marked increase in my reading. Perhaps it is because I like the way it feels in my hand. Or, perhaps it is the backlit, non-reflective screen which makes reading easy under any circumstances. I like technology and the Kindle Paperwhite delivers. I made the jump years ago to all-digital reading and had been relying on the Kindle app on my other devices. Wow! What a difference the Kindle Paperwhite makes! The pleasure factor in reading has increased exponentially! I did not anticipate this. If you are contemplating, like I did for so long, purchasing one of these, I cannot recommend it enough."
Barbs,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m very disappointed in this Kindle. The battery life was longer on my old one and I find it’s not as easy to access my library as my old one. The battery died and after it was recharged, it didn’t go back to the book I was reading. I had to go to my library and find my book, fortunately it went to the page I was on, but it took more steps than I think should’ve been necessary. For someone who never owned a Kindle before, this would be fine, but if you have another one to compare it to, it’s a disappointment."
Patrice Antony,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm slowly becoming a fan of this reader. I have always enjoyed the paper print experience, but I am converting. It is SO nice to be able to slip your ""books"" in your purse without weighing yourself down. The screen is just as readable in bright sunlight as it is in the house. The battery life is about a week and it recharges quickly. The mistake I made in the past was trying to get a device that ""does it all"" like a tablet. Forget it. Buy this to read with period. It is worth it. Get a nice ""book like"" cover and you still feel like you are reading a book."
Kindle Customer Bob.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Product worked well, as advertised, until today. Won't come to life. Says ""waking up"", screen frozen to that sentiment, with an ad pushing a book about George Washington. Does not respond to swiping the screen or pushing the power button. And I just passed the allowed return date a week or two ago. Any help would be appreciated.

Update: Contacted Kindle support, responder had me hold down the power button for a longer time than I had previously--and--oila! my paperwhite came to life and acted like it should. Thanks Surya, for fixing my problem and contributing to my education, also. I'd tried holding the power button down prior to asking for help, but I just hadn't held it long enough. Now we know."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the Kindle with the special offers. I find these to be no problem at all and would even recommend them.

I have never had an E-Reader before, so maybe my standards are lower than many others, but I absolutely love my Kindle Paperwhite. I used to read when I was younger, but as I grew older I slowly stopped until I didn't read at all. While working at a popular retail store, I saw the Paperwhite and started questioning whether or not I would use it or not; needless to say, I bit the bullet and I would argue it was one of the best investments I have made recently.

I began reading more than I ever have, and I love the convenience the Kindle provides! I read every night for about 2-3 hours and my battery lasts for weeks. To me, this came as a surprise after reading all the negative reviews that say the battery is absolutely atrocious. Not only is the battery well past my standards, but also the display has little to no glare when reading outside and is easy on the eyes when reading in the dark.

I don't find much use with the bluetooth or audiobook features, despite using Audible on my phone. It is not nearly as convenient as the mobile app considering I enjoy using it while driving or performing some sort of activity involving movement.

I would highly recommend anyone who wants to invest in a Kindle to look into the Libby app on their mobile phone. I found it shortly after I got my Kindle and it has been a blessing. It allows you to check out library books and have them sent directly to your Kindle!"
Kevin Babb,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I guess I expected something more generally full featured. The Kindle browser would not allow me to logon to some free Wifi that required that I agree to security terms before they would assign the device an IP address. I just could not figure out where my Audible library was either and the helpdesk folks capped off my experience and helped me decide that I wanted to ship it back. Then they wanted me to ship the stuff back in two packages. OMG, can we invoke common sense? Just because you shipped this in two pieces doesn't mean it cannot be returned in one. Are you not stewards of the company's dollar? Please don't forget to credit me for the cover and screen saver."
RB73,2.0 out of 5 stars,Major issue: this is for my mother who has issues with her sight. You cannot change the font or viewing size of the home screen! What a terrible and disappointing thing to miss! She's 86 and has age related macular degeneration. She can make the font size of the books large enough to read comfortably but the _home page_? No! Absolutely disappointing. Please update this asap.
CClemmer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's lightweight, even in it's hard back case. It fits in my purse. The ability to read absolutely anywhere in any light condition is a dream. Even better I don't get headaches when I read anymore. I didn't even realize that I was getting them until I started reading on the paperwhite. I just stopped having low grade headaches. It's glorious. I don't know how I lived before my paperwhite."
Jacob Cunningham,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I thought ""damn this thing is small"" and ""the bevels are huge"" but it's also light/nice to hold
I also like how easy it is to buy books/load them up since it's an Amazon app essentially the operating system is the Amazon store haha. Not entirely seriously but still.

It's really cool technology, I mean it is what it is
I like it, chunks down books nicely, has a browser too that's pretty neat

Edit: I don't like that it has ads on the screen savers"
Alias,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Barnes and Noble Nook for many years and I have to say that the quality of the images on that device certainly was superior to the Paperwhite, but of course the price was quite a bit higher. For a reading device, the Paperwhite is fine and the size is great. After using it for about a month, the only thing that bothers me is the placement of the on/off button on the bottom. It's too easy to accidentally bump that button while using/holding the device and placing it at the top would make more sense."
Chelsea Sunderland,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My kindle paper white is great! It works exactly as advertised and the battery life is amazing! I got mine 3 weeks ago and havent charged it since the first day. It weighs slightly less than my girlfriend's kindle oasis, but doesn't sit in the hand as uncomfortably. There is a delay with the touch screen, but that didn't come as a surprise to me after doing a ton of research on ereaders. What I read, they all have that due to the type of screen used. The back-lighting is great and easy to adjust.
That being said, my only two complaints are that the power/sleep button is on the bottom of the device (right where my pinky rests when I'm holding it with one hand) and that the kindle store doesn't allow you to make a ""shopping cart"" (at least not that I've been able to figure out). The second isn't so much about the kindle as it is the store.
All that in consideration, when I started searching for a device for an electronic library, I didnt know if I wanted an ereader or a tablet. Let me say that if you want something that is the most like reading a book, go with an ereader. To me, anything you could do on a tablet, you could do on your phone and the extra bells and whistles of a tablet seem redundant when I think of that."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the paperwhite for my University classes, many have e-books now and you can rent them as a cheaper option. I got it for that use specifically something light and larger than my phone app which is also inexpensive. The textbook rental worked fine on my phone app and when I got the kindle paperwhite yesterday it says it is not compatible with the textbook. I tried looking online for a reason, perhaps its because its a rental I don't know but I have to return it. Its only purpose was to have something that didn't take up my phone battery and I could easily use in class. It is probably fine for other uses, all other regularly bought books downloaded with no problems. I don't know if other rentals would work or not only tried one but I can't take the risk of waiting till next semester to find out."
Val R,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite after having used a Samsung Galaxy Tab for several years. I liked the Samsung, but was unable to read in daylight, it was hard on my eyes, and the battery life sucked. The Kindle Paperwhite solved all of that!
The touchscreen could be a bit more responsive and I wish that it was just a bit taller in my hand, closer to the size of an actual paperback book.
Battery life on it is wonderful! I just got back from a week on the road and read every day for hours while we were on airplanes and waiting in airports and only had to charge it once.
Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a nice reader at a good price."
Matt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally got tired of my phone screen and too lazy to keep going to the library, so asked for a Kindle. The screen looks great, syncs up well and is so easy to carry around. Fits in my jacket pocket if need be. The audible bluetooth feature is cool, and it looks like a real page when you're reading it. Only mark downs are for the not amazing touch screen responsiveness and the fragility of the screen. Haven't broken it myself, but feels vulnerable and I've heard many folks say to get a case ASAP. Still, happy with this product and reading loads more."
Andrew P.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my old paperwhite to buy this one. I wish I had kept it. This new paperwhite has horrible battery life. My old one could maintain a charge for a month. The new one has to be charged every other day. The device is a tiny fraction smaller than my old one, just enough so my case no longer fits. It has long ""wake up"" times every time I go to use it, then I have to plug it in cause the battery is dying. This is not worth purchasing. Buy an old one instead."
Tidbit,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It needs a longer charging cord! It is barely long enough to go from the strip to the top of my night stand, and if I didn't have the strip, the charging cord would not reach the wall outlet. I had to purchase an additional USB cable that will reach my table. There are things other than the cord that I don't like as well. Like underlined words, highlighted words. It doesn't seem to have some of the features that my previous Kindle had. That I had to another cover because the previous cover didn't fit."
brandy,2.0 out of 5 stars,I just filed a claim on this today. It just stopped working after reading only one full book. Hopefully they will figure it out after I send it in. Other then this it is perfect for reading especially at beach and in sunlight. Probably was one of my favorite products with exception of trouble it is having for no reason. Hopefully amazon will fix it or replace it since I haven’t had it long.
D.L. Herrington,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the fact that a Kindle is streamlined for reading and I am not distracted by email and web access as I am on my iPad mini. I had been using an older Kindle Keyboard model for years, but realized that I really had to plan on where I would be sitting so I could have enough light to read. This Kindle Paperwhite model solved my light problem and it has double the storage capacity of my older Kindle. Fantastic! I bought the version with ads and they don't bother me."
Jamie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using Kindles since 2011. I read about 10 books a week (I'm retired) and enjoy carrying around hundreds of books to select from once I've finished the previous book. I bought this Kindle for 2 reasons: 1) it's waterproof, so I can safely read in the bathtub and 2) the storage size is double the size of my previous Kindle, which means I don't have to delete books from the Kindle as soon as I finish a book to have room for new books."
R,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love to be able to take a library with me wherever I go. When I finish a book, I can get another one immediately without having to take time to go to a bookstore or library to find a book (although I STILL like to browse the library shelves or loiter at a good bookstore). One great thing is the electrons representing all those books weighs a LOT LESS than the paper versions. I think you'll like it too."
Mark G,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my kindle, have been using for almost a year now and still works like a charm. The water-proofing holds up well, my kids have split some drinks on it a few times and had no issues. While i haven't tried testing it by dropping it in a bathtub it does seem to hold up nicely with daily use. The interface is easy to learn and to navigate for non-tech crowd, accessibility features are nice and easy to enable for people with failing eyesight (haven't tested out the Bluetooth that links to headphones/speakers yet). The battery life is exceptional on mine, I've read some reviews about some devices going dead in a very short amount of time. One thing I have always done on mine is keep it in airplane mode when not downloading any new books so that will help my battery life as well."
marilynroth99,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a new Kindle paperwhite on June 10, 2019. It does not work ! Font size keeps changing sizes and does not go back to correct reading place. I called to get a replacement but instead of sending a new kindle in replacement, they chose to send me a cheaper REFURBISHED ONE. I ALSO BOUGHT INSURANCE ON THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH FOR AMAZON QUALITY & PASSENGER SERVICE."
Bernt A. Monsen,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is very nice, thin and lightweight. However, the claim of a VERY long lasting battery isn't necessarily so. Mine didn't last a week, so I sent it back and had it replaced. From the tech I learned that what THEY consider average use is 30 minutes reading time per day! No book reader I know only reads 30 minutes per day. That's magazine time at best. So, if you are an avid novel enthusiast don't expect much improvement in battery usage. Better plan on plugging it in once a week or so to keep from getting the ""battery low,"" warning just when you don't want it."
Jazelle Realina,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my Kindle Paperwhite, no more distractions on finishing novels. Bought this to read new and old books without being distracted of other apps. The special offers doesn’t prevent me from enjoying my ereader, it actually help me discover new authors. I love that I can send my pdf docs to my kindle without using any complicated apps. The size is perfect and it can fit perfectly on my small hands and no more books to take around long trips. Battery life is good, with continued used: it lasted me a week on the first charge out of the box."
Nick Borrelli,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had multiple e-readers from multiple brands over the past 10 years and I keep coming back to the Kindle Paperwhite as my absolute favorite. If all you are looking to do is read and you don't need the bells and whistles of video streaming, apps, internet access etc... this is simply put the BEST digital reading device I have ever owned. The screen is crisp and clear, the fonts are very readable, and the device itself is incredibly lightweight but durable. It also has a highly adjustable backlight for night reading that does not strain your eyes. I read over 100 books every year and this product has never let me down."
Brian Hollingsworth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot get enough of my new Kindle Paperwhite. I had been reading iBooks/Apple Books for years on my iPad; while reading on iOS devices is fantastic in its own right, reading on a Kindle is something special. The Kindle’s extraordinary battery life provides a sense of dependability that my new e-reader will be available at a moment’s notice. Its size is convenient for holding during stationary or on-the-go reading, as well as for quickly packing and removing from a backpack with no concern over bending a paper cover. The most magical feature for me, though, will always be the glare-free E Ink display. To sum it up, the Kindle Paperwhite is my new favorite way to read."
Kenny Caudill,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't understand the appeal of this thing. Dislikes: (1) It's screen area is barely bigger than my Note 5, yet it has a huge black area around the screen that makes it uncomfortable to hold. (2) Memory is only 6 GB. While books don't take much space, I find it ridiculous to make any device with this little storage. (3) Downloading my books. It seems this device is deliberately designed to make hard to move your library to it. Amazon tries to force you leave them online and only download a few by making it hard to load. You can click titles one at a time on the device or, supposedly, go to your content on Amazon, select titles and then select Deliver and the device to send them to. This wouldn't work. Tried it multiple times but it never sent the books. WHY DOESN'T THE DEVICE HAVE ONE SIMPLE BUTTON TO DOWNLOAD ALL MY BOOKS. I see tons of online searches by people trying to do exactly this and this is what nearly every buyer would want to do as soon as they get the thing. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!"
Allison Manzano,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great gift for book lovers! Also, if you have a resolution to read more, this is the way to go. I've already almost completed my first book of 2020! The light makes this perfect for reading before bed and the battery will last you over a week. Very convenient. The design is seamless, although I will admit, fingerprints visible on the screen do bother me, but it's nothing that can't be quickly cleaned. My favorite purchase since I use it to often. If you're debating buying it, do it!"
Rachelle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love reading and I used to be against Kindles, but I decided it would be a nice thing to have for traveling, etc. This is my first Kindle, so I can't compare to older models. I think the readability is great, however, there are a few flaws.

I'm no IT guru, but the screen refresh rate is completely awful. When you click on something, you almost think you have to click on it again because the screen is so slow to respond. This has been the case since I first opened it, so I think it's normal. I think this is pathetic for such new technology.

I also feel like it's fairly small and awkward to hold, but I've gotten used to it over time. The power button is on the bottom, which is annoying if that's where you prefer to hold it. Overall, I'm glad I purchased it, but only at the lesser $80 deal. I never would have wanted to pay $100+ for it."
AlwaysBusy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"""Attaboys"" for the Paperwhite development team!
Likes: flat face doesn't catch ""debris"" like my Gen 2 Paperwhite did; time at the top of the page; tap to turn page seems more sensitive; feels thinner & lighter ( I don't use a cover ); more variability on font sizes
Dislikes: still trying to come up with one
Wish list: configure day & date with time at the top of the screen; configure to lock location/page setting at the bottom"
JS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had still been using my first Kindle reader with the keyboard and buttons to turn the pages (yes, they are still around), but the battery life was pretty non-existent and I don't like reading for long periods of time on my iPad or Kindle Fire.
I was skeptical if I would like the updated version as it is much smaller and uses touchscreen only. I'm very happy with both the size and touchscreen as it's lightweight and its a much easier transition to turn the pages instead of the old ""button"" type. I'm finding the battery life very good.
The only thing I can't comment yet on is the waterproof feature."
wandering reader,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This replaced an old model with a tiny keyboard. The keyboard only sort of worked over time, the device had a mind of its own, turning off spontaneously and rebooting, or finally not turning on at all, even with a good charge. I’m very happy so far with this new device which is user friendly and works as advertised. I don’t use it outside so can’t say anything about ease of use in bright light. My only reason for not giving it the highest rating is my short time of ownership with this model and my experience with the previous model."
Robert Showers,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used the same 1st gen. Kindle since 2009, klunky keyboard and all. Even after several keys broke (I can be clumsy), I saw no reason to upgrade. Only when the battery died did I bite the bullet.

There is no reason to hesitate to upgrade to the newest paperwhite! I am pleased in every way. It seems so tiny - but the actual reading area is slightly larger than the 2009 version. The battery lasts even longer. You can choose different fonts and adjust the screen in more ways than before (font size, contrast, brightness, border area, etc.). Turning pages by touch screen took a little getting used to but not much. Getting to the menus is much easier now. Arranging the book collections is easier and more versatile than before (I have hundreds of books onboard).

I think that it would be easier for someone to switch from paper books to this newest Kindle than it was for me a decade ago using the older Kindle. Upgrading from an older Kindle is definitely worth it!"
Jelly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle is extremely easy to carry around. I always have it with me either when I'm home, traveling, or working always reading whenever I can. The battery life is extremely good as I use it for hours and hours and only charge it once a week with around 10~20% left on it's battery. I never thought I would use it as much as I do now. My only one issue was the power button is on the bottom and would sometimes get pressed by accident whether it was in my pocket or if I was holding the Kindle a certain way. However after getting a cover for it the problem got resolved."
Joanna,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I resisted buying for a long time, preferring paper to digital. Although I haven’t lost my love for the tangible feel of paper and the ease of locating something I vaguely remembered 6 chapters ago, I like the ease of use with the Kindle. It is lightweight, and I love the ability to switch to a black background with white text. The touchscreen is a little weird for me, it often takes a couple of tries to click on something I want to highlight. I love the vocabulary builder function! It allows me to easily look up those words I “know” from context clues but haven’t ever bothered to research. I especially like the fact that it gives word origins as well as the ability to look at the word in the content of the text. I did end up paying to remove the ads, I found them annoying, and the illustrations they have are nice. I just wish it would show the cover of the book you’re reading as a screen saver. The battery life is great, I have no complaints. Even when I did have to charge it it only took a couple of hours to fully charge."
anonymous,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I do feel the screen glare is worse when comparing to the previous generation. I can deal with that.

The placement of the on off button on the bottom of the kindle is HORRIBLE. I am right handed and typically hold the kindle with my right hand. At least 3 times a sitting I hit that button long enough and it want to turn off. Distracting annoying. I wish I would have replaced my broken kindle with the later model."
TJLAWSON,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Having had other Kindle prior, I have to say I am rather disappointed in the size of this one, it's smallness... and in the very poor design element of putting the off button on the bottom, right smack in the area where it is most comfortable to hold so that you often hit it just enough to shut it off while you are reading. Endless annoyance."
Suzanne,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant about the Kindle feeling that the reading experience would not be as good as holding a book. I was wrong. Actually, I find I read MORE often with the Kindle than with a book. The screen lighting is better than with a book in that I can read in bright light or a dark room. Especially good on a plane! One thing I do struggle with however is the touch screen to turn the page. It is too sensitive and I sometimes get lost because the page was accidently changed simply by touching it."
Adri,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As a long time Paperwhite user I am disappointed. I have been using the new one since shortly after it came out but switch back to my old Kindle frequently.

1. I do a lot of reading in the dark and the new Paperwhite doesn't get as dim, making it more strenous on the eyes

2. Definitely has glare issues when reading in light

3. The feel of the Kindle when I flip pages is dry, always makes me feel like I need lotion

I do like the waterproof feature and the slightly smaller size.
4."
Kenna Armstrong,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only had two e-readers in my life, the original Sony e-reader from yearrssss ago, and Nook's first HD tablet. Both sucked, and it made me want to stick to just reading regular, physical books. However, I decided to jump in with the Kindle Paperwhite because it was on sale and I really wanted something I can read books on and still travel with. The minute I started reading on the paperwhite, I was sold. Honestly, don't think I'm going back to physical books unless I have to. It has a really good battery life, it is super responsive to my touch and it's lightweight. The only thing that kind of annoys me is the flashing of the screen every once in a while when I flip a page."
Samantha Alul,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The All New Kindle is absolutely perfect! After years of owning past generations of the paperwhite kindle, I was reluctant to buy the new one- my old one worked perfectly. After having the new kindle for a bit, I’m so glad I upgraded! I love that it is finally waterproof and the flush front without the raised edge adds to the sleek feel of the new kindle while also making it easier to wipe clean if needed. The new rubberized back also grips surfaces much better than past generations making it less likely to slide or fall down when propped up for reading.
I also use it with my Audible subscription and love the fact that I can now use one device for both reading and listening. While past generations were all very similar, the All-new Kindle really stands apart from the rest with much needed upgrades.
Now back to reading!"
Arpit Goyal,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved the product even with all its problems. Let me first go over the problems - a user of iPad and iPhone suddenly the kindle geeks very slow to response. The scroll and page turn are slow.
Now the cool part. I've 6 months of free kindle unlimited. And then the continous reading. In two weeks with three books done I'm super happy using it. The battery is also really cool lasting almost 10+ hours of reading time.
The ads are irritating but don't pay the extra $20 to remove them."
Kim205,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m still discovering all the features and how to incorporate them into my use, but I absolutely LOVE my Kindle paper white! I carry I everywhere with me! I found a great case that enables me to prop the Kindle up while I’m getting ready or when I’m eating. The battery is AMAZING! After having to charge things like my phone multiple times a day, it was so nice to not worry about battery life! If you’re on the fence about getting one, I’d say go for it!!"
Cano,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the feel of a real book but finally caved in and got my first kindle after many friends recommending the paperwhite series. I cannot compare it to the older models but so far I do like it. I have had it for 2 months and use it daily. The battery is very good. I have only charged it once so far. And I like the fact that it is easy on my eyes compared to looking at a phone screen or regular tablet as that was my main concern when purchasing. Overall very happy to now have all the novels I can ever want in one convenient place.
Nicholas Owens,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I both have the 3rd generation Kindle Paperwhite and have loved them and use them daily. Seeing our enjoyment, our pre-teen sons both wanted paperwhites and so we splurged for the ""all-new"" 4th generation Paperwhite. Shortly after unboxing each of them and setting them up, it became apparent that the ""all-new"" version is actually noticeably slower/laggier than the previous generation. My suspicion is that the added bluetooth functionality is slowing down the device remarkably, to the point that the touch screen feels defective. I might believe that we just received a bad device, except both of the Paperwhite we bought for our sons have the same issue. The general sluggishness, coupled with the new screen and bezel materials which feel cheaper and collect fingerprints like none other, lead me to the opinion that this is a generation worth skipping. Buy the older Generation 3 Kindle Paperwhite, maybe the 5th will be better."
Phil,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My Kindle Paperwhite arrived a couple versions behind and for some reason would not automatically update. This also caused issues getting my library to pull down. I got tired of fighting it, so I manually updated to the latest version and did a reset. Now everything is working fine.

BTW, I am used to iDevices for touch screens, so 3 stars on the horribly unresponsive touch screens on any Kindle I've ever seen is very generous."
Barbara,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I resisted buying an e-reader for years, considering myself a ""purist"", only reading hardback books. I did have a Kindle app on my phone for ""emergencies"", but didn't use it much. Those books weighed a lot when taking several on vacation, and ended up stacking up in my home, overflowing my bookcases. So I bought this, and I LOVE it! It's so very portable and convenient. With the Kindle Unlimited, I can try different sorts of books, too, without feeling obligated to stay with my usual choices. It's great!"
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Can't figure out how to darken the print when I'm reading.
Arthritis in my hands make this Kindle much easier to handle than my old one. However, I guess I didn't read the description carefully enough because I didn't realize it is only for reading. I thought it would do everything my old one would. But I do love it and persuaded my friend to buy one too. She's 95 years old so I had to coach her a little and I have to buy the books she wants."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Battery doesn't hold up as advertised. It barely gets through the day. My previous Kindle paperwhite lasted for a few days.
Stephanie Sorbet,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m a long-time kindle user, and really excited to get the newest version for Christmas. I was looking forward to the idea of using my device to listen to audiobooks, as well as the enhanced battery life. As a device, in general, I love my paper white, but as an upgrade, I have to say that I’m a little underwhelmed. First of all, the device won’t directly play audiobooks, but has to be paired with a Bluetooth device. Okay, I’ll admit, that helps keep the size and weight down, which I appreciate.

The thing is, I don’t feel like I’m noticing improvements to how long I go between charges, and that was a thing I was really hoping for. I have to wonder how much time Amazon expects it to be used on a daily basis. I have poor eyesight and stopped buying printed books a decade ago, since with my kindle I can make the print in what I’m reading large enough to be comfortable for me, but I’m also a hard core reader, which means I’m charging every few days, not the weeks touted in the sales material.

The long and the short of is that kindles are a great alternative to print books, light, easy to read, and fit in my pocket, but I’m not sure the latest improvements live up to the hype."
Maximiliano Silva,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well... I am mostly old school, I love books, the smell, how they look in my bookshelf, I am the kind of person that would buy a book just because it is a nice hardcover collection edition. However, I realized I was spending way too much money on books sometimes I don't the time to read and not taking them with me because of the weight. The kindle provides a solution to those two problems, it is practical, lightweight, battery lasts forever and books are cheaper. I won't stop buying books but it is a great buy."
jlthom1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got my new Kindle Paperwhite just over a week ago. When it arrived, it had 50% battery life. I figured I would go ahead and wear it down before charging it. It still has yet to run out of juice. It just now hit 15% battery life remaining. I read every night after my son goes to bed, generally for anywhere from 1-3 hours at a time. This thing is great!
The only weird thing is when I tap to go to the next page, it does a weird fade out kind thing. It's not bothersome and doesn't seem to have any effect, so not worried about it.
No glare, no need to adjust anything. Love it."
cjmat,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I went from a Kindle Fire to the Kindle paperwhite. What I really liked about the Paperwhite is the very light weight. The Kindle fire has a glass screen, making it very heavy. If you like to read laying down, as I do, your arm eventually gets numbingly tired trying to hold up a Kindle Fire. Not so with the Paperwhite. What I didn't like about the Paperwhite is the ability to read with a black background at night, so that I don't wake up my husband in the middle of the night. Nonetheless, I now prefer either the Fire or the Paperwhite over a hardback book any day!"
Melissa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very disappointed in the battery at first. I thought how could they put this out when it drains the entire battery overnight simply by putting my book collection on it? Well, I was ready to return it and get a refund. I did some research and found some help. It suggested holding down the power button a full 40 seconds. Ignore any prompts and let the Kindle reboot. This worked like a charm and my battery has been excellent ever since. I love my Kindle and the screen is just what I wanted. I highly recommend it."
Ed McCullah,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My old reader which I bought used from a neighbor would connect and stay connected to my wifi thru a Netgear extender. But the touch screen began to act up and I bought the new Kindle Paperwhite. It will not connect to my wifi extender even though the signal is strong. I have tried standing next to the extender, but still get the same error message that it can not connect. We also have a Kindle Fire (2013) that has always worked great and connects easily. I chatted with an Amazon tech support and he had no ideas other than call Netgear?? He said my Kindle was good?? I am about ready to return it!!, but not sure another new one will work either. I've even thought about returning and getting a new K Fire 8."
Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve used the kindle app on my phone for a while but using the kindle is great because it doesn’t come with the distractions.

I’m also surprised by the battery life. I leave the kindle on airplane mode and turned down the light to “7” and it’s lasted multiple weeks at this point. I’ve been really impressed.

The screen/display is fine. Nothing to write home about. There’s a short but noticeable pause when you navigate. That’s fine with me. Kind of like, I’m turning the page.

It’s light. Very light. The one thing I would change is the grip. The border is small, which I like because there more screen for reading. However a wider border would be better for holding the kindle in one hand. I think I would go with the design of the kindle Oasis but the price difference is too great."
Katelyn,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had this product for a total of 6 hours, 6 hours on and off of trying to get it to connect to my WiFi so I can download my books. Not only does it not recognize 5GHz WiFi, it also won’t stay connected to my 2.54GHz either. I tried logging onto the WiFi for 3 hours before it connected for 1 minute and booted me before I could register my amazon account. I had a Fire before this, and purchased this one for the battery like and waterproof feature, too bad those features are useless with a device that can’t even download books. Amazon/Kindle needs to address the selective WiFi connection in the product details. This junk is getting shipped back."
June Cook,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used a Nook for eight years, so it is taking some adjustment to use the Kindle. Navigation is a bit of an issue for me. I can't see the page number in comparison to the hard book. My eight year-old grandson had to show me some of the navigation features. I read on the beach often, so my paperwhite works very well. Also, I haven't found many good choices from the Kindle Unlimited books. It is frustrating that the cost of a best seller is high. The overhead for an e-book is zero. Even with author royalties, copyright costs, etc. why does an e-book cost more than a paperback? I digress.... the Paperwhite works well for me."
Michael W. Rodriguez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was initially concerned with the size of the kindle, having used iPads for my reading. The iPad, however, beeps and pings and chimes, all of which have a place in the operation of the appliance. The kindle does nothing but store my books to read when and how I see fit. The readability is outstanding, with the font large enough for my aging eyes without being obtrusive or obvious. And it small enough to carry in a vest pocket or EDC bag and not take up much space. I am most satisfied my kindle."
TCB,4.0 out of 5 stars,I was only surprised at how much I missed COLOR that I had when i used the Kindle App on my phone. But I no longer have to reinstall things every few weeks like on the Phone. All my 400 or so books fit in about 1% of the 27 GB memory. Resizing fonts and using the built-in light is all super easy. The Home page could use some redesign work to suit me better. But its a very minor issue. I no longer need to wrap my phone inside a freezer bag to read while taking a hot soak. This is water-proof on top of everything else. GREAT BUY.
John Koehm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned a series of Kindles over the years (I usually drop them on a hard surface and break them, necessitating a replacement) and LOVE them! I take them everywhere I go, even backpacking and hunting. I can carry SO MANY books in a Kindle and read whatever I am currently in the mood for. Cannot do without one!!! P.S. the waterproof feature is a good one for me. I drowned the last one (it was not waterproof) in a day pack in the bottom of a boat."
Ed Bauer New York USA,4.0 out of 5 stars,"won't work with wifi 5th generation routers. the fire tablets work with new wifi routers. buy a fire tablet.
So, I returned it by putting the ups label on the box. Amazon sent the ups label to me. I put the Kindle Paperwhite and a TI calculator inside a box and brought it to the ups pickup site inside the Big Six Pharmacy on Queens Boulevard near Key Food and Gina's Pizzeria.
I brought the labeled box there in the beginning of March. Now it is a month ago and Amazon doesn't recognize the return of their items. Their ups label."
Rob Blackwell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this as a present to replace the 2nd generation Kindle Keyboard. Though that still works, it has had issues for a couple years. Moreover, I wanted a backlight. The new Kindle Paperwhite delivers in spades. It boots up fast, provides a pleasant back light, is easy to turn pages and is a great little device. I don't know if I needed it to be water-proof but I'm not sorry for it because one day I'd love to read it in the bath (if I ever had the time). Anyway, I recommend it to those who have a Kindle collection or want to start one."
Maryann E. Miller,3.0 out of 5 stars,One would think that the newest version of Kindle Paperwhite would be new and improved. It seems the same to me EXCEPT that it is VERY slow to wake up. I wish I still had my original Paperwhite. It woke up quickly and was just as easy to use and the price was much better. One problem with all versions is that the clock is super small......would be nice if Amazon can update this and make it wake up faster and have a larger clock option.
Sean Baker,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a revision of my old review.

The battery life is bad unless you turn airplane mode on, which is a shame since that used to not be an issue. I am also not a fan of the power button as it can be easily touched when you don't want it to and you can't rotate the screen 180 degrees.

I would still recommend this product, but the battery without airplane mode is pretty bad for Kindle standards and the power button detract from my experience enough to notice it."
Plubo Jort,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I read on Kindle a lot. This battery doesn't have as much life as my five-year-old model still does. Also, the page turn is unreliable; sometimes it goes in the wrong direction, sometimes skips a page. And I have to hit the Home icon twice most of the time to get to the home screen. After I do get there, an ad pops up. Also, it has to be rebooted nearly every day or the Remove from device option morphs into Delete this book. It's not kidding, either; that book will vanish from the account."
G. Rogowski,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a fire tablet but sometimes i just want to read a book that feels like reading a book. I like the kindle for books with pictures, magazines or shopping amazon but to read a novel or just print material it was heavy and not like looking at a paper page of a book. This paperwhite has no glare, I do not need color to read printed book and very light to hold and carry. Fits in smaller handbags or purses for travel and the battery last so much longer than my fire tablet. Good decision."
Britt Spaulding,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best for just plain reading a book. Easy to read, clear, non-reflective, works in the sun, battery lasts a very long time, quick to start up, small size, light, and now water-proof. Have Kindle Fire's which are great for many things but not as nice for reading a book. Other tablets, I-Pad's and Galaxy all have the same reflection and sunlight problems, which the Kindle Paperwhite basically eliminates."
Bibiana,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 5th Kindle. I live in the Sunshine State and there’s nothing better on your eyes than a Kindle to read in the sun, or when is raining, or when your partner doesn’t want a night light, your Kindle is perfect for bedtime reading without disturbing your roommate! The IPad, the Fire, and others don’t compare. Kindle is light, fits in your purse and is the perfect companion for traveling. Would’ve trade it for anything. Unless is another Kindle!"
Josh & Trisha,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a first or second generation kindle that wouldn’t charge anymore. I really liked the simplicity of that one and the fact that it wasn’t backlit. This newer version allows you to choose backlight or not-which I love! This is very similar to the one I had before but is a little more lightweight and does offer a couple of other features. However, I’m glad they didn’t mess with the design too much because I really liked my other one."
Nazeer Hyder,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reading the Dune series on my Kindle Paperwhite. Syncing into my account, library, and WIfI were a breeze, which I vastly appreciated. I HATE the touchscreen, I can never high light individual words to look them up in 'Dictionary', it ends up highlighting entire paragraphs. It is a well made product however, turns On and Off lightning quick, durable (dropped several times already), and works as intended. One thing I hate is how I can't disconnect advertisements from being plastered onto my property as it sits in my home. That is totally invasive and unwelcome"
gardenchick,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it to take on trips. The only drawback is that it is so small that I have a hard time holding on to it. The on/ off button is on the bottom which I think is a mistake, it should be on the top, it’s too easy to hit it. I have a cover for it so I hold on to the cover after it is folded back"
Anthea Atwell,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have an iPad Pro which I normally use to read books but it was next to impossible to read when I am outside sitting by the pool. I decided to buy the Paperwhite mainly for this purpose. It’s a huge benefit that the device is also waterproof- now I won’t be super paranoid sitting too close to the pool. I like the size of the device- it’s small enough to hold in one hand. I just toss it in my purse and it doesn’t add much weight to it at all. I had one of the original Kindles and loved the buttons on the side which would advance/ turn back the pages. The Paperwhite took a little getting used to but now... I don’t miss the buttons at all. The battery life is phenomenal. I have used it everyday for about 3 weeks and have charged it once- only because I wanted to make sure the battery held it’s charge. Overall it was a great purchase!!!
JBora,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my 2012 Paperwhite for the newest one in hopes of making a big step forward, having more features, etc. I was disappointed. You would think in six years there would be some progress. I wish it was now in color (the book covers and the Kindle shop). The processor is a little faster, but most other things are the same. Listening to audio books is no benefit to me. I would do that through my phone and the app, if at all. It is only slightly lighter and thinner than my previous one. Barely noticeable. I'm glad I got a good deal by trading in my old one and thus receiving two discount. I wouldn't pay full price for it."
Yoonhea Namgoong,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First the one bad:
Having a power button where most people naturally hold the device from was probably not the smartest idea.

Nothing but love:
I've had this little device for about a year now, and to be honest I replaced the previous generation oasis with the new paperwhite when it came out. I know gasp a down grade, but really I didn't see it that way.

This device is easier to hold, and I really love that it's not a metal backing but a nice soft to touch material.

Smooth page changes, it doesn't have a bad lag or anything.

Quick charge. It takes me an hour maybe to get a 100% charge on a dead battery.

This replaced most of the books in my home. I love books, but I started minimizing the materials in my home and books were one of the things we cut down on.

I like this one, and I actually plan on getting one for both my boys too. They have the fire tablet, but I think for reading it's nice to have something that won't distract you into playing games or watching a show. Just some good old fashioned reading."
Paul,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this knowing some of the limitations but it still seemed to be the best e-ink reader I could find as in the ecosystem (both buying books and renting from local libraries). Here are some rooms for improvement I wish it can improve upon.
- still uses USB B charging port at 2019.
- UX & touch feels clunky. Kind of hard to navigate from reading page to the setting.
- Kindle does emit blue light.

Pro
- compact size
- great battery life"
Alicia M. Fernandez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased an 8th generation kindle - non paperwhite. I was very happy with it, though I needed a night light to read in the evenings. My husband bought me the new paperwhite waterproof as a Valentine's day gift. What a treat! I love this thing! While I do still use dim lighting at night to read, I probably wouldn't really have to. I could just dim the backlighting on the kindle. This is a great little product. Moreso, knowing I can vacation near water and not worry about damage should it get wet."
Stacy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As my very 1st e-reader, I had nothing to compare to so I will tell you what I love about it!! I love that I can read in the sun light and it not have any glare at all!! It actually has a ""paper"" like feel to it which I adore! The only thing I was kinda disappointed about was the size I wish it was a little bigger like a regular book would be, maybe not as big but at least a little longer. Other then that I love that I can read whatever I want on it and it's waterproof which is great especially when I use it a lot relaxing in the bath and even by the pool I don't ever have to worry about my kids splashing me or anything, which is a great feature for me!!! I do wish I could use 3rd party apps on it for downloading books. If I can I haven't figured out how to. And I wish it did give the ""lines"" option. For example, I wish I could choose whether the book had lines under the words or not, it doesn't have that option like I have seen on others out there. But, all in all I love my Kindle Paperwhite!!"
Christopher Schultz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely outstanding for reading. I honestly prefer it to a paper book for many reasons. The one problem is the extremely slow response time during anything other than turning pages.

I was surprised when I got this that the typical response time for any action is between 1 and 2 seconds. Every action, whether that be scrolling down a list of books, or highlighting a word to retrieve a definition (a fantastic feature, btw).

However, purely based on the experience of reading on this device it more than meets my expectations."
Sandra W,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the Kindle ... except I must have made a mistake along the way in ordering. My prior Kindle was stolen. So, I thought I would get the newest paperwhite and include the audible feature. Well, I unwrapped it, set it up, and foolishly didn't check for the audible outlet. Duh. After all that, I just decided to keep what I had. Definitely disappointing though. I also ordered a leather holder for it and am pleased with that. Albeit a bit pricey."
Buttons,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is either my 4th or 5th Kindle and I like the changes they made with this one. The lighting and print quality are improved and the download speed is fast. Kindles don't normally wear out that quickly - I'm disabled and home bound so I read an abnormal number of books. I have been known to average 10 or more books a week for months at a time (get very bored with tv). This Kindle is also noticeably lighter making it much easier to hold. I bought it during Prime Days.
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new Kindle. One of my favorite things is that you have to start it yourself. My other one would open up when you open the cover. I like being able to start up and cut off when I want. I love the having the lite, in fact I didn't ever think about it until after I got this one and I love it a lot. I've had a lot of Kindles and they have all worked just great for me. Now if I could just have more time to read them, I'd be a lot happier. You keep making and I'll keep upgrading."
Banksiana,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this to replace a Voyage that was stolen. Miss the Voyage terribly. I've also owned previous version of Paperwhite which was a better reader. Was thrilled at the water resistance but in operation this model is super annoying. Power button is sensitive. If I use it on very smooth treadmill not only does it turn itself off but it goes into full reset mode (dialogue box offers a cancel option, but if you hit the cancel button it still goes through the reset). I guess its only made to use held in your hand. Or perhaps Bezos is trying to pay for his divorce settlement by forcing the purchase of covers. Someone should be fired."
Cat J,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite is really easy on the eyes with the front lighting. I can read in bed without the bright backlight keeping my husband awake. I don't see the real advantage of being waterproof though. Unless you read in the bath tub or on the edge of a pool it really isn't necessary. However, the water proof design does keep crumbs and things out of the edges of the screen. It weighs next to nothing and fits into an extra cosmetic bag I have. Just to keep it separate from all of the other stuff in my bag. I don't think a cover is necessary but if you like the look or feel you need one they aren't that expensive. I find mine is easy to hold on to and I'm not worried about it slipping or falling out of my hand. The off white pages attend as close to real paper looking as it is marketed but it is definitely an improvement over the backlit older models. If you need a waterproof one, this is for you. If you're not worried about dropping it in the pool just buy the previous version and save some money"
Big Wave Dave,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Traded n my old paperwhite due to battery issues - would not hold a charge very long.

I like the new design and it’s lighter weight. However, the claim for longer battery life (time between charges) is not proving to be true for this Kindle. I’ve been using it for less than one month and I’m close to needing to charge it for the third time. Also, a negative for the new, sleeker design makes for more accidental page turning."
LeftClique,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm sorry I bought this Paperwhite. I expected the best of the best, but it's the worst of several e-readers I've owned. The screen isn't nearly as clear or easy to read as an iPad, a cheap Kindle Fire, or my first reader, an early Paperwhite bought in 2012. Adjusting the font, brightness, layout, etc, is completely non-intuitive and requires looking through several menus. The readable screen is far less than the actual dimensions. The battery life is days, not weeks."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from the keyboard version (really old, I know). I had a waterproof neoprene case for it, to read in the bath. The water resistance was a huge selling point for me.

I was concerned about it being small (and it might be for magazines), but it's great for books.

I also really love the front lighting option, it feels more like a book with a book light l, instead of a phone or tablet.

It is a touch sluggish with lots of books loaded, but isn't most devices?"
TigerCat,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is 1980 technology sold at a rip off price. For $171 one can get a really nice smart phone, without a SIM card, go-to coffee shop, log on to the web and down load the Kindle app and get books in color, Sharp text, adjustable back ground and text. On this Kindle reader the text is not sharp, the background is a bad color of yellow, and the functions are slow, the internet access is slow. Everything is so slow 😭😭😭 I would not recommend this product."
Martine Lille,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The only kindle I've ever used is the app on my iPhone. I got this kindle paperwhite for Christmas and I am not impressed at all. It's clunky to use and I'm spoiled and I want color!!! When I use it, I am usually connected to my wifi at home so you would think it would be a smooth transition, but it takes forever to go between looking for a book or going to the next page. It's frustrating. All is not lost because I do use for bedtime reading."
C. Little,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated: After having this for several months now I'm lowering my rating to 4 stars. I still think this is the best reader in it's price bracket, but the power/wake button on the bottom of the device is almost infuriating. It's placed perfectly so my pinky often hits it while reading putting my Kindle to sleep. I'm not sure why anyone would put this button on the bottom rather than the top or side of the device.

Lightweight, tons of memory for my books, fairly quick for accessing the bookstore. Compared to the Kindle Voyage I also tried out I think this one is definitely superior, despite not having physical page turn buttons."
Justin McIntosh,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The long battery life is the reason I came back to a paperwhite from a fire. The addition of waterproofing is nice, if only because it saves me from having to waste rice drying out the reader after it tips on the tub, sink, or other body of water.

The user interface is not super intuitive. Readers use to a fully digital iPhone or iPad type display will be disappointed by the lag in loading pages. The lack of a scroll bar means that I will likely keep using my Fire for research, because it is a more painless scroll.

Despite the drawback, the Paperwhite is a good reader and I am happy with the purchase."
Bbill56,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The light failed for my Kindle, less than two years old. I read at night in bed, and depend on my Kindle having its own light. So, I bought a Kindle Paperwhite, as a replacement. Problems: Kindle Paperwhite is smaller than my Kindle, so that it is too small for the book cover for my old Kindle. This book cover provided protection for my Kindle, and, when the cover was closed, the Kindle shut off. Now, as much as it cost, in addition to the cost of the Kindle that failed after less then two years, the book cover is useless. Very, very disappointed. Would have looked at other options if I had known this in advance."
plyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok. This is my first kindle for reading purposes only. I own a Fire HD10 - 2016 edition.
Love both. But the Kindle Paperwhite far surpasses the HD for reading. It is comfortable to hold and REALLY does not stress my eyes in any light.
The HD is wonderful for browsing the web and watching TV/movies and great if you have magazines you like to read because of its outstanding color and pixel properties. It’s also good for reading but, I find the paperwhite way better!"
ashleyep3,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only complaint I have is a small maybe quarter sized portion of the screen in the bottom right corner is fuzzier than the rest. Not enough that I will send it back, this is my first ereader and so far I'm pleasantly surprised how much I like it. The backlight is blue and that's a little frustrating. Luckily my glasses have blue light filter in them. I have about 70 books on it already, barely used any storage. The ads dont bother me. It came with a 50% charge. I've downloaded all the books and read for roughly an hour and it's at 47%. I have yet to try the bluetooth audible function."
Zack Shannon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because I'm having surgery on my shoulder and I'll be in a sling for 2 months. I needed something for one handed reading and everyone recommended the paperwhite. Two weeks in and I've already read two books, I really do enjoy this kindle. My biggest complaint is the lack of buttons for page turns. Trying to read with one hand and turn pages sometimes is awful. I'll either skip to far ahead or drop my kindle trying to do the motion. If I had to buy this again I think I would pass on the paperwhite and get the oasis or an older Kindle with physical buttons.

If unlike me you have two hands you shouldn't have any issues. I definitely recommend it."
Aaron,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First time kindle owner here, so I can't speak for long time fans of the long-running device. Its only been a couple days, and its already becoming one of my favorite devices, period. I've owned a few tablets and smart devices for e-reading in the past, but none of them really felt as great as the paper white does. Its such an elegant little device that'll fit almost anywhere and not feel out of place, battery life is okay and the kindle selection is pretty outstanding. This definitely beats having to wait a couple days on book orders from Amazon, and for a significant cheaper price in some situations. If you're on the fence about buying one of these, definitely do your research and figure out which model is for you. The 8gb model is certainly enough for me, but grab the 32 gb model if you're going to be using this to store audiobooks and magazines. I can't recommend this device enough, I never leave the house without it anymore."
Loria N,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second trade in Kindle. My first one purchased in 2010. It is not working anymore and I want get the newest version one. I don't know how many versions Amazon upgraded during these years, but this new paper white one is so awesome. It is light and thinner which I like it so much. It fits well in my hand and my 7 years son's hand. Great flush screen and adjustable back lighting. Easy tap to turn page. oh, I really love thin Kindle. I was planning to give it to my son and now I think I can share it with him."
Craig J. Watson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received it. It's light and smaller than the tablet I've been using and that's why I bought it. The materials used and overall quality appear first class. If it holds up well (only time will tell), I'll be happy, happy with this purchase. I didn't like that it seemed quite proprietary at first, but I've learned how to get books from my local library. That's what I mainly wanted it to do."
Jim R,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle, second Paper White. My 7th gen PW developed charging port problems (a common problem, apparently) and I would have repurchased a 7th gen PW had they been available new. The touted improvements of the tenth generation PW mean nothing to me. I use a MoKo vertical flip cover (which I recommend) so thinner is no advantage. I have no problem removing books I've read so the extra memory is unused. As far as being waterproof, I try not to drool on my Kindle.
What I don't like is having my books listed by the book covers instead of just the title and author. Awkward and a waste of space. Page turns seem a little uncertain and perhaps a bit slower. It is still a good reading experience but I do miss my 7th gen PW; maybe I'll get it repaired."
Ivan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well and fast, without any hints of bugs. Great touch screen, awesome kindle options for reading, such as connect with amazon account & goodreads, and reccomendations. Widely settings & costomise options. Appreciate you amazon for making things for better experience, like: dictionaries, word wise accesiability, notes, ect. That's still best device even without USB C. Hope USB C will come in next generation..."
CRC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This my 4th kindle (Lost 1 and Broke 1)
Pros:
Great reading display, may get the larger one next time.
Works great in all lighting environments. (Sun and Night)
Charges fast.

Cons:
Page turning slower than older models.
Shutting down is slow and a hassle.
Battery does last as long as advertised. (Even in Airplane mode)
Navigating interface is not good, I try not to use it, other than selecting a new book to read."
Lois,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven’t used this Kindle enough to properly rate it. What I do know is that it is so very different from the first Kindle I had and enjoyed for years. The games that I regularly played on my old device are not compatible with this new one which means buying more or just forgetting about games. It appears that I can get books on it, but doing so I’d, again, quite different from what I’m accustomed to. In short, I don’t like this Kindle. And I’ll add that prior to purchase I called Amazon with questions, and the man I spoke with was no help at all."
Chris Cubbage,3.0 out of 5 stars,It does not come with a charger!
Mary B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle works great however, aside from being waterproof there isn't much difference from the older models. One thing I don't like is that they changed the size just enough that my old Kindle Cover doesn't work. It still fits, but will not automatically turn on or shut off when opening/closing the cover. Have to turn on manually or buy a new Kindle Cover for $40.00. My eyesight is not the best, so I really depend on my Kindle. Hopefully this one will last longer than 2 years which was the lifespan on my last one."
Shelby Posch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle and I love it!! The battery life is insane. I use it nonstop and have had it over two weeks and have only charged it once, and it charges super fast too. It feels like reading an actual book. Reading on it doesn't give me a headache like reading on a tablet does. There's no glare even in bright light. Reading on it in the dark is comfortable as well - it's not super bright but plenty visible. It's awesome and has gotten me reading so much more since it's so portable. Love that it's waterproof as well! It's nice getting to read it in the bath without worrying."
Henry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I researched this e-reader a lot. I'd never owned one before, but I decided to take the plunge now. The technology is mature enough that most kinks should have been ironed out by now, right?

I am very happy with it. I'm a heavy reader, so battery life does not last 'weeks' for me, but a few days, which is plenty. I manage this battery life by keeping the kindle in airplane mode, except when getting a new book, and only using the backlight when I need it (which is while reading in bed). Most other times I read in well lit areas, that do not need the backlight.

I also decided to wait until I had it to decide if I wanted to get a case or cover for it. There are a lot of third party options, so I wanted to gauge what I want from a case before I buy one.

Overall, it's light, sturdy and the display is excellent. A few people at work were impressed with the screen, and are looking into getting one for themselves."
PM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Being a sucker for gadgets, I buy new versions of various electronics products to just try them. Often times I am disappointed in what might be called an updated version of something to only incrementally different then it's predecessor. In the case of the new Kindle Paperwhite, it was just the opposite. This is a terrific product. I am a prolific reader whose eyes have the tendency to tire after an hour or two. This does not happen with the Paperwhite. It is comfortable to read with what I would call the perfect brightness. It is also easy to operate and maneuver around from page to chapter to library, etc. It is so good I might have a difficult time ordering the next version when it comes out. I am not sure how it can be improved."
TJC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this to replace an older 1st model Paperwhite. While reading on the old Kindle was fine doing anything on WiFi, such as searching or buying books was painfully slow.
This one is as quick as using a phone or computer connection and as I’m still using the same home connection so the improvement is down to the new Kindle.

If your old Kindle is driving you nuts because of speed and you wondered if the new models are any faster then the answer is yes. Dramatically faster."
Waterbug,2.0 out of 5 stars,I used this kindle for a few days while attempting to resolve the issue that my new Kindle doesn't show which books in my library have been previously read. Worked with three tech service folks at Kindle & it was recommended that I return the unit until such time as an upgrade is developed to add this information. The % read only shows up on the first three books when the Library is opened and not the rest. Unit returned and have ordered a 7th generation Kindle Paperwhite which is what I have used for years until it developed a pin hole in the lens. I really liked my old reader.
Mason’s Moma,4.0 out of 5 stars,I made a late night shopping decision that changed my reading experience. Reading on the Kindel is amazing. The screen is different than a smart phone or tablet. It's much easier on the eyes. I can pull an all nighter reading and my eye not feeling the pain of staring at the screen for 8 hours. My biggest complains are the advertised battery life was shorter than I expected from the advertised amount and the screen could be more responsive.
Almarie Rush,3.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this and its alot smaller in size than my first kindle and it doesn't come with a plug??? Seriously who's idea was that Considering sending it back not what I expected UGH so fustrating was so looking forward to replacing my kindle which I lost on vacation.
Theresa from CO,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been glitchy right out of the box. The screen is easy on the eyes which is nice, but the product design was a bit careless. They put the sensitive power button on the bottom so you can't prop this ereader upright (like if you were wanting to eat and read at the same time) without it triggering a total restart of your device. The odd part is that the power button is really sensitive yet it takes a long time to bring up the screen off option. The internet browser capability is also glitchy and doesn't pull up the overdrive website properly (which I find ironic because that is where you would search for library books to rent- so you'll likely still need to use your computer to search and check out books and then sync with your kindle). All in all, if you're fine with dropping cash on an imperfect product and just want something that is easy on the eyes this Kindle suffices."
Chris H,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't tried books yet, but I have been using to read the Wall Street Journal daily. I live in a rural area where newspapers only come by mail, usually one to three days late. So by the time I'd read them, they'd already be out of date. This Kindle downloads my paper each morning automatically and then I can take it with me. The screen is clear and easy to read even in sunlight. Also, unlike tablets it doesn't have to be at a certain angle to see the lettering clearly. Just a great new way to read."
Grandma in NY,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I still find myself trying multiple options for anything I want to do, about three weeks since receiving this as a gift. It's annoying and frustrating. I wish it offered less, and offered it in an easy to find way. Show me the books I've purchased and plan to read before showing me a bunch of books that might interest me, or probably not. Another example: I ordered my first book for this kindle and it did not appear where it used to on the old kindle - the most obvious place. It took a young person to locate it for me."
Obelix,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was thinking about getting the new paperwhite because ofthe sound feature. I lost my old kindle and ordered the new paperwhite. Synching the bluetooth headset to it was very easy. It ran on fully automatic. However, I noticed that the new one takes a lot more time to wake up then the old one. The battery is remarkeable. It lasts a long time and the recharge time is really short. I haven't tried any audio books yet, but i am looking forward to it."
Mitchell Geiger,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really excited to get one of the paper white readers cause my old iPad 2 is dying. I got the newest version (2019) for a Christmas gift with a case.
After I got it charged I noticed the case didn’t fit. While trying to find a replacement it was a nightmare cause of the subtle differences between the versions. Easiest way I found was to register it to my account and look there.
While using it, it wasn’t complicated, but without reading the instructions, you wouldn’t know where to tap to turn the pages or get back to the home screen. Hint: Tap around the top of the screen. Other features I liked is that it’s waterproof, cause spills happen with kids AND adults too. The memory seems adequate for basically black and white text and battery life is good.
The main annoyance is that the screen, which is supposed to be “advanced”, is not. Reminds me of an Atari with slightly better resolution. The responsiveness is sub-par for today’s screens and there is obvious latency between page turns and going to the home screen, menus, etc. What a shame."
dcc,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this expecting a nice upgrade from my older Kindle but other than being waterproof, it seems worse in some ways. The inconsistency of the touchscreen is the main issue. Often it doesn’t work at all especially trying to select things in the store and in Goodreads. Or I have to find just the right place to touch. Reaction time is slower as well. Page turning is fast. Battery life is good. Definitely should’ve just kept my old one."
Kyle Brucker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I replaced a previous version of the Paperwhite after several years of faithful service. My older paperwhite still ran perfectly--except for the screen damage I accidentally inflicted during a recent trip. My expectations were high for this new Kindle Paperwhite and I have not been disappointed. I love the many ways one can customize the screen experience (fonts, size, brightness, custom actions, note taking, easy vocabulary lookup, etc.) on my kindle. I used to miss the smell of ink and paper, but the many features offered on my Kindle have me hooked!"
Melissa C. Reyes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I enjoy reading, but some of the only time I actually get to read is after my daughter goes to bed. She's currently in a bassinet beside me, so I couldn't use a reading light, it was too bright and would wake her up. So I got the Kindle. It's a nice size screen , lightweight, has a darkness accessibility mode so the screen is black and the words are white so it's super not bright. I also love that I can still use my Library borrowing app to rent books from the library!!! Use it almost every day."
Laurie Zolas,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was using a Kindle Fire, which I liked, but this Kindle is much, much lighter, so I can lie down and read without my arms getting tired. The back light is good and the standard settings for the font make it easy to read. Also, the battery recharges quickly, and each charge lasts for a much longer time than on the Fire. I like the fact that it is waterproof, but I haven't tested that."
Angie,5.0 out of 5 stars,The paperwhite is true to its word - great for outdoor bright light or indoor low light. Waterproof for beach reading! Holds lot of books. Small but just the right size. Lightweight and thin - perfect for travel or reading in bed.
Ashley Gibson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've never had a Kindle or thought that I wanted one. I thought I was a strictly paper book reader, but now I have one and I LOVE IT. It's super light weight and I can read it anywhere. The battery lasts about a week before needing to be recharged, and I use it every day. The screen does have a slight delay when looking through the menus, but not enough to bother me. The backlit feature is amazing, I can read in any level of light with no strain on my eyes. Late at night you can also invert the text to be white on a black background and it makes it very easy to read in full darkness. I just love it, no complaints from me."
JJ Goodtimes,5.0 out of 5 stars,The paper white is much easier to read from and see. The navigation is different than my old kindle and that takes some getting use too. The screen is a touch smaller but not enough to be a negative. I haven't tried the waterproof part and have no plans to do so. Electronics and water are not a good combination no matter what the claim is.
L Walsh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter bought me this for Christmas and I love it. I had gotten both my children (and my mother) kindles as we are all avid readers. I have arthritis in my hands and wondered if it would be hard to hold but not at all. It's super light and the size fits my hand fine. The light is a must, love to read this before bed and not have to have a light on. I haven't had it long but I know this will be a tool I will have forever."
avid reader,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband asked for this Kindle Paperwhite for his birthday, but he couldn't read it as the screen was glitchy, coming in and out of focus. We had to return it. When I bought the Paperwhite through this listing, there was a toggle button to select a blue or black cover to buy with it. I bought the blue cover.

When I returned the Paperwhite and cover, I was charged $7 to ""restock"" the cover. Complete waste of money. Such a bad experience, we bought an iPad locally."
Ron R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased the 2018 Kindle Paperwhite for my wife for Christmas. Her Kindle Keypad was tired, unable to hold a charge, so I knew that it would end up in the ocean any day soon. The new Paperwhite is amazingly easy to set up right out of the box. It has a larger screen, which is backlit, so those are nice improvements over her Keypad reader. And, most important, Amazon assures a longer battery life in the Paperwhite. My wife picked it up, in its leather cover, located the book that she was in the middle of when her old Kindle was sputtering, and is now a happy gal again. What's not to like!"
AnnieM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an 8"" Fire, which I liked, but it was 5 years old and starting to lose battery power quickly. I bought the new Kindle Paperwhite, and although smaller, it works great for reading! I love the backlight for reading in bed at night so I don't have to turn off a light when I'm half asleep. Just close the book and put it down. It's light and fits in a small purse so you always have something to read if you end up waiting somewhere."
Francis C. Cary,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for migrainers. Use of paper white vs bright back lit screen makes it easy to read w/o causing strain on the eyes and/ or migraine triggers. The adjustable viewing screen - light level, font type and size -allows further options for maximum viewing comfort."
A. Prescott,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Kindle Paperwhite allows one to read in the bath or lounging in a pool. The touch surface is sensitive but not overly sensitive. I find the options to keep Audible and Kindle E-Books in the same library space refreshing. The back-light allows for reading in the dark without bothering one's significant other with ""too much light.""

As a cautionary note, I am finding that the battery tends to drain a little quicker than advertised. I suppose it depends on what items you tend to access on Kindle."
Martha B. Foerch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I like this kindle very much. Still there are a few things which could be better like the touchscreen. Sometimes it accidentally changes to something I did not want. For instance it jumps forward when I turn it on, or a feature turns to a smaller size.
When you leave WiFi on it definitely does shorten the battery life tremendously.
Since I dropped my last kindle in the bathtub accidentally I appreciate the waterproof feature, even I dare not to check it out."
Chad,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I previously had a Kindle Paperwhite and I traded it in for this one because it’s waterproof. I love the design of this one but it seems like there’s an issue with the backlight because it flashes even though I have the feature turned off for page refresh, if I have the inverse on (so it will be dark at night). Hopefully this will have an update to fix soon."
Spencer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I lose kindles constantly, and will consistently replace them. With this one you can invert the text and background. So the text is white and background black. Lots of people are still stuck with 'I like the feel of books' yah, I hear ya. However, I like to have many books with me. It would be great if you could link kindle to libby, or something similar to that. This version also adds your audible account. I haven't explored whisper sync yet so can not speak on it. I tell my friends kindles are the best e-readers, but to be honest I've never used anything else. Please don't let them know =)"
Ken,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Kindle user since they were introduced. Initially, it was hard reading in electronic form and I often found myself switching back to a paper-based book. However, as the technology improved -- and I became more used to reading ebooks -- I now prefer reading from my Kindle rather than from an actual paper=based book. The newest Paperwhite is extremely light, sized perfectly to be held in one hand, slips into my backpack while traveling and holds over 1,000 of my ebooks. I absolutely could not live without it."
John O. Pickitt,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was replacing a Kindle that I lost. I thought I was getting the same one. It's probably my fault for not reading all the fine print because this model does NOT have Whispersync like my original. I really liked it when all my devices would be in sync no matter where I was. With this model, you must be within WiFi. Unfortunately, signing into a wifi on this model is very difficult if at all. I have not yet been able to sign on to wifi at any hotel...and I travel for a living. As far as reading...it's a Kindle...always great."
Rebecca,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Set the kindle to dark mode but it still flashes white when turning pages. It's hard to navigate the touchscreen to get back to my library. Otherwise, the dim screen is okay for nighttime reading but still not as dim as I'd like. The battery life is excellent, however. And the kindle unlimited service has a good handful of books I'll be reading over the next month.

The paperwhite is small enough that I can hold it one handed, but only just. Lightweight. The screensaver? has me concerned about an afterimage. Is my goto when my phone is quite low at home."
Teresa L Lutz,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite 10 has a serious flaw. The battery life is an extreme disappointment. This is coming from someone who has loved the Kindle product for years. If anyone asked if they should buy one, I would have normally recommended it. However, the version 10 Kindle Paperwhite is not good. I did a test by charging the device to 100%. The background illumination was set to only 1/3 intensity. After reading for 75 minutes, the Kindle had used 20% of it's battery life. 20%!!!!! For comparison, the charge on my previous Kindle would last a full MONTH. How & why has Amazon degraded their product in this way? I called the Kindle customer support & that was disappointment as well. It was not possible, apparently, to actually speak to someone who actually understood the product. They can only read from their scripted screens. I have basically spent a good chunk of money for a piece of crap! My advice is not to buy one."
C. Kirk,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the compact size, goes easily anywhere with me. It is only black and white which I hadn't thought about when I purchased it. That is fine for reading but finding the book on the list you want is more difficult. I have trouble with getting to home screen or settings when in the middle of the book. The touch screen is not as responsive as I would like. It was very frustrating to me. I think it should be easier to navigate."
mj,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reading is amazing on this product. I can get lost in a good with the Paperwhite in ways I can't seem to do with a regular tablet or phone. It's small enough to fit in a large pocket, but big enough to easily see the 'print'.

Not such a big fan of the main screen. It's a little tough to navigate, but only compared to a tablet. It's manageable and it does a great job with it's core function, so no worries on the ancillary processes."
Thomas R. Edgar,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Did not get the discount promised in the email promo. Quite different from the original kindle. No archive. Everything that is on my list, including some of those I have already read, are identified as unread.
Probably upgraded technology but no apparent difference in reading the book."
John Doe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Lost my Kindle of many years so replaced it. I had to move up to Kindle Paperwhite in order to match most of the features I had on my original inexpensive Kindle.
Battery life is not as long as my old Kindle and especially short if you leave WiFi on by mistake.
The journey through the settings menu is a little challenging. I still haven't been able to find a way to switch my library to list mode.
All in all however, I am very pleased with my Kindle Paperwhite and would definitely recommend one to select it for reading. Have had Kindle on phone app and Kindle device for years and there is no better, above notwithstanding."
smokin_B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this after my well-loved Kindle Touch started locking up on me. The waterproof feature and the ability to read outdoors were the two major features influencing my decision to buy this. I miss the old-school games I was able to load on the earlier model, but I also have a Kindle Fire with enough games to keep me satisfied. I can't read the Fire in bright sunlight, thus the need to replace the basic reader. The Paperwhite is lightweight, small, and slim making it easy to slip into my purse when travelling. I am very pleased with this purchase and hope the Paperwhite lasts as long or longer than the Touch."
selma864,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This little Kindle is truly amazing! The battery life just goes on and on. It’s compact, lightweight and small enough to slide inside my purse for reading on the go. I absolutely love it. I purchased the cover and the Kindle goes to sleep and immediately wakes up when opened exactly to the last page read."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have not had this item very long so can only say I like what I have seen so far. The cable did not fit but when I called Amazon they corrected it immediately. That is a big plus with items from Amazon. They stand behind their product. I really like the way it looks in the cover I ordered. Would buy again.
Connie N.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this as an upgrade to my older Kindle paperwhite (which I loved) because I liked the idea of it being waterproof. But now I'm sorry I did because this version is a big disappointment. It just won't hold a charge. When fully charged (or at least the light is green), I will read it for a couple of hours, put it away for a day or two, then find it to be completely dead the next time I pick it up. This has happened several times. I wish I kept the older version which worked great and lasted for a long time on one charge."
MetaChuck,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The item is most definitely for READING ONLY and I wasn't expecting the weird screen ""blinking"" when I change screens; the screen goes almost all black and then ""reloads"", slowly. It reminds me of a web page refreshing. In terms of eye strain, it's great, easy to read. It's small, but large enough not be like reading on a phone, more like an average paperback and it is INCREDIBLY light. I am satisfied, but for the money, I expected more impressive technology. At least quick, seamless screen changes, but from what I've gathered after do my research that's the nature of the technology used to make is easier to read. I should've done my research BEFORE buying, but I'd still get it. I wanted it ONLY to read and the convenience of having a small, light item to store many books. I got it."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, this is not a tablet. The screen does not scroll smoothly and you do not have crisp resolution. Anyone expecting it to behave like a smartphone or tablet is in for a rude surprise. If you have doubts, go check one out before you buy.

This device is for reading books. At that, it is second to none. My headaches that I normally get from reading a computer screen go away WHILE reading the kindle paperwhite. It is a joy to read with."
Warren W. Wiley,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It IS probably thinner. Battery life no more than the Kindle I have, which is main reason I bought this one. This is my 6th Kindle so you can see I am a confirmed user. Got tired of having to charge me other (5th) Kindle so I bough this new one strictly because it said how much MORE battery life I could get. Not true.
I still have my old one (5th Kindle) and I use it now while the brand new one is charging.
Whoopee!"
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I give it 4 stars only bc of one thing. I’m constantly accidentally turning it off bc of where the power button is located on the bottom from how I hold it. I have a pop socket on the back of it & the way I hold it one handed means I hit it all the time. I wish they would move the power button to the top so that it is out of the way. Other than that I absolutely Love this!!!!! This is my third one only bc I keep giving my old ones to my kids & bc I need more room. I know I can keep stuff in the cloud, but I tend to re-read & it’s easier to keep them downloaded on my device."
MKK,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I would return this item but the return window has closed. Why did I wait so long? I stopped using it because it was so annoying to use. Yes, I should have returned it immediately so now I'm stuck with this albatross. This kindle is definitely not as user friendly as my other kindle--the only thing it does well is show you ads. The number of ads and suggestions drive you crazy. Please! just let me find my already purchased books to read in my own library first, before you show me all the others I might like. Basically, I can't find my library books due to the amount of advertising related to what I might like. I can't recommend this Kindle Paperwhite--I'm going to use my ipad for now and find something better."
S. Eaton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I only use the kindle for reading books. My only complaint is changing the font size. It seems it is very easy for the screen to change the font again. For example, I fall asleep reading. The kindle politely goes to sleep too. But it is laying open when that happens. Later I open the book and the font is huge or too small. Perhaps the link to change fonts should be in a different location. It seems awfully easy to change the font size without intending to."
hammer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this as a Christmas present from my beautiful bride. Still learning to use it, but so far it's great. The touchscreen is a bit sensitive, maybe because I'm used to paper books where I can rest my finger on the page in preparation for turning the page. But I can be taught! The backlight is fine, the choice of fonts and size is good, and the battery life seems excellent. I also got the leather case that is magnetic and puts the Kindle to sleep when closed. All in all, I'm very pleased with the Kindle."
Kenton H. MacDowell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle ecosystem itself is getting pretty good. Still some limitations, but if you're reading lots of books, the limitation of dozens of physical copies also has obvious limitations. Plus, you can't use a computer to search a print book.

One step up from the base model, this Kindle is plenty convenient with good readability and long battery life.

The Fires have a few problems, and I also read a lot of Kindle books on mine, but that's probably why Amazon separated them.

These are pretty cheap and whatever they lack in sophistication is made up for in ease of use and portability."
Romance Addict,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked that it was very lightweight. I liked that you could adjust the brightness. I liked that it was easy to set up and all my books from my first Kindle were there. My first Kindle was purchased in 2010 and I would still give it 5 stars.
I do not think it is easy to navigate between books. I find it a little hard to hold so my fingers are not touching the screen. I miss the little notches on the side of the old Kindle to change pages.
It's okay but will take some getting used to. It's just not as simple as the older version which I am still happily using."
Ray,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the convenience of having a lightweight e-reader that I can take to the beach or the pool without fear of it being damaged by being splashed. I also like that I can read it in direct sunlight and it is never washed out. What I DON’T like is the fact that this is my second Kindle in as many years. The first one died a sudden death just twelve and a half months after I got it. That was very disturbing to me. At least Amazon offered a discount to me to re-purchase a replacement. That relieved the sting a bit. I suppose I just got a bad unit. I don’t know of any others who have experienced a total failure in such a short time. Fingers crossed with this new one.
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle paperwhite (last ereader was a Nook) and I'm very satisfied. It is light, the screen is sharp,
and at nite, the lighting is fairly evenly distributed. It is waterproof but I haven't been in need of this feature, yet.
Lastly, the battery last several weeks (I've just recharged it when it
got to 50% and it had been a month since last charge). The only issue is that it only uses Amazon mobi format and to
get the epub ones, you'll have to use a converter before loading them to the Kindle."
Shelley Barton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had two Kindle Fires and this is my first Paperwhite. I love that it's waterproof so I can take it to the pool or beach and still be able to read. I was unable to do that with the Fire. I also love that my Paperwhite slides into my coat orjacket pocket and it is so light, it makes it so easy to take with me whenever I think I might have an opportunity to read."
SHELBY L RUSSELL,1.0 out of 5 stars,"HUGE disappointment, Amazon! I received my new Paperwhite 2 days ago, got it registered, etc. But then discovered it WOULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE! It would be fully charged at night, and then be at zero battery the next morning. Contacted technical support who wanted to know what software version - well it is whatever came with the device. Had to tell me how to check it, and of course my device had a different version. OK, then you need to update. Plug it in to your computer- ""No my computer is not recognizing the device""; oh, you have to use the cord that came with the paperwhite- What??? ""I do not have that cord with me""; ans: well it will update when connected to WiFi; ""It is connected to WiFi now and is not updating"". Oh, well then I suggest you reset to the factory default. OK, fine, go through all the set up again; and the software is STILL the old one; it did not update, as the tech support indicated. Not surprised. and NOT happy, Amazon!"
C. Lawrence,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using a kindle for over ten years and as a product I love it. My last kindle was purchased in 2012, so when I got this new one I thought I would be all sorts of impressed with the improvements, but I was mostly aggravated. The installation process was very easy, that was nice. But I lost my favorite game ""Every Word"" and I miss it. I agree, the kindle is primarily for reading, but every now and then you want to take a little break, so I don't see the harm in supporting a few simple games. The other aggravation was that it now takes me three screens to get to the feature to change the font sixe instead of just simply going to the top of the screen. So I saw no benefits and two disadvantages - hence the 3 star rating. And $40 for a kindle cover that fits, really????"
Michael F. Merriman,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was actually happier with my old paperwhite. The battery on this one lasts half as long and sometimes drops a lot for no reason. The unit sometimes freezes up and requires a hard reboot. I like that its waterproof, but doesn't seem to be a step forward."
Russell Alan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a little disappointed that this model is a little slower to load pages or to change screens. Also ... since I have had this model, it has several times ... ok ... 4 times ... not started up when I opened the cover ... the new cover I purchased with the Kindle. I love the smooth surface, the light weight and the slightly smaller overall dimensions The screen is the same size so overall, this model is light and easy to use. Fix those couple glitches and I will give you 6 stars publicly. I love the Amazon Kindle Product. I love the availability of books. :o)"
Nunyabness,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got this to replace my old paperwhite and love it. I had some small cracks in my screen and just wanted the upgrade so I could give the old one to my daughter. I haven’t found any of the problems others have mentioned and I dropped it before I got to even open it up. I dropped it on concrete and it didn’t scratch or dent so it’s pretty durable.
Sanghi,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This purchase was an upgrade from my Paperwhite purchased 3 years ago. In terms of the functionality it appears to be the exact same as my old Paperwhite. I’m most disappointed with the fact that it holds a charge for the same amount of time as the old device. The description of this new device states that it will hold a charge for weeks versus days. Completely untrue. The waterproof feature for me will be useless as I don’t read my Kindle near a pool, in the rain or while bathing."
Jen,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was excited to get the Kindle, it was my first one, but when I got it, I was really confused at how choppy it was to turn the page. It freezes and takes a moment to load every time I try to turn the page, and I don' know if I got a faulty Kindle or if it is meant to be like that, but it makes reading off of it really unenjoyable. Also, I don't think the battery lasts as long as it states because mine shoots down very quickly within just a few hours."
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"1-Extra (2X) memory is a real plus.
2-I don’t think the built in light is as good as my previous version of paper white.
3-The touch screen is an improvement over my traded in paper white.
4-The battery life is not any better than the one I traded in after using three years.
5-Waterproof is fine but not necessary for me.
6-The Browser is not worth anything. It should be removed. A good and functional browser would be great.
7-The trade in program and bonus to upgrade is very good."
rianblade,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It does what you want it to do and it's been great with that, but since we're in the era of fast response touchscreen this device acts like it's in the early 2000's when touch screen was coming out. I know they programed it to function like that to save battery, but they could of given us the option in the menu to turn off and on the green performance. Like o said it does what you need it to do but eh was hoping for a bit more."
Michael Ray,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife got this for me for Father's Day. I am an avid reader and have been consuming books this past year. My Kindle fire is really good but for long reading spells, the Paperwhite wins hands down! I can read and read without feeling fatigued.
I would love it if it were larger. My Kindle fire is perfect size but heavy. The Paperwhite is light but small. I have a picture comparison. Overall I really like the Paperwhite for reading.
The case on my Fire is a reposed book cover. I love it! Can't do that with the Paperwhite very easily."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite does not have a computer style screen which is perfect for someone who, like me, is visually impaired. I have had E-Ink Kindles in the past but was told the paperwhite would have the same visual comfort as the E-Ink. I was skeptical but when my old kindle died I decided to try the paperwhite. It has worked out well for me and has the added advantage of the light so I don't need to turn a lamp on at night when I wake up and want to read to get back to sleep. My husband appreciates that feature as well! I do not like the display of the book covers in my library list. Since the paperwhite is black and white I can't make out the pictures anyway. The pictures make the list of my books very busy and hard for me to find the book I am looking for. All in all, I am a huge fan of the kindle product in general. Without a kindle I would not be able to enjoy reading because of my limited vision. The kindle makes being blind much more bearable!"
Gerri L. Oliver,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon needs to bring back Kindle active content for their Kindles. Reading is a bit of a pain as even with brightness all the way up the display is dim. Can't organize a danged thing in a meaningful way. Need to be able to ""archive"" a book when you finish reading it so it is out of your active books to read, not remove it, just reorganize it on the danged list. Overall I'm not enjoying it as much as I'd anticipated."
Krystin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I saw a couple comments about battery life which prompted this review. Just as a comparison, before buying a Kindle I had just about every generation of a Nook ereader back into the early 2010s. Those batteries were terrible if wifi was on. Even my Glowlight 3 (only about a year or two old) only lasted for around 3 days with wifi on. I got this Kindle on Christmas and left wifi on as a test. I've almost completed two books in the week and a half since, I have kept wifi on and the backlight has been on at varying levels for the vast majority of that time. My battery is around 30% after a week and a half of pretty consistent use. Compared to the Nook that is amazing. There are admittedly some things that I liked about the Nook format better than the Kindle but the fact that I can keep wifi on and it works well with my local library through the Libby app has won me over. I'm very happy with the switch to Kindle."
Stanley King,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I replaced a Keyboard Kindle with this and find it clearer, very little reflection and much improved software. HOWEVER, it is not waterproof as you find out when you read all the fine print warnings. Yes it can be rinsed with pure water but avoid spilling on it or immersing in any liquid; wipe splashes immediately. From the advertising I thought I could use it snorkeling! HA!"
Sarah L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I know that I will recommend this to everyone, even if they have an ipad or tablet because there is no comparison!!! I don't have annoying notifications, or phone calls, I can read and it allows me to just focus on book!!! I love it so much!!! recommendation is a 10 out of 5 for me!!!"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't throw away your money. I miss the first kindle I had. So much more available. It struggles to respond to my touch. It doesn't hook up to all bluetooths like it should. It's not user friendly at all. The text to voice option, where is it? What was wrong with having that option on the book at the bottom?
I have always liked kindle. It sped up my reading in college. I would read it on my computer screen and play it on my device. My reading comprehension and speed went way up. With this device, there is no speaker, not head phone jack and the bluetooth is crap. I used to listen in my car as I drove, but the bluetooth is so bad it cannot connect."
M. Hunt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got a seriously good Black Friday deal plus trade-in for my basic reader. Major upgrade, love the backlight since I’m quite often reading in bed after my wife dozes off, even reversing to white on black sometime. Easy to navigate, plenty of storage. Even the off button at the bottom is a non issue if you have a cover and who doesn’t want a cover?! Although I agree it would best be at the top.
Haven’t tried dropping it in the tub yet 😆. Expect a long life if it’s as durable as last one having survived 100,000 miles on a tour bus."
Phill,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If this had been my first Kindle it probably would have been 5 stars. But I was trying to replace an older Kindle Fire. I thought the paper white would be at least the size of that Fire. I couldn't tell its size from the Amazon description. It was much smaller than I had expected.
And when I tried to register it, I couldn't figure out the keyboard for special characters. The keyboard could have been better designed."
Mike Gillett,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the paper-white. This new generation is lighter and clearer. I like it for the most part.

My criticisms are: 1) the wake up takes a long time in comparison to the previous generation. 2) The Cover art wouldn’t download for the device until I restarted it a few times then re-downloaded the books a few times."
Bob Cromwell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought one for my wife last year and loaded many of my investment books on it. We both couldn't read it at the same time so I purchased a second one for myself. You may sync the two so that both can share the same books in the same family. Excellent product and better than a book. Can read at night in low or no light and it's so easy to flip pages.
Lise N. Pellerin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this reader! I listen to audio books in the car and when I'm alone at work. I read kindle books at other times. It is small and light, but the fonts can be changed for these aging eyes. With the backlight I can leave the lamp off to read. I received this as a gift but had plans to purchase myself. It is the 32gb size. Before I had an 8gb one and the 32 is worth the extra money. Especially considering audio books. I am extremely pleased with my gift."
mw,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So you want to be cool like everyone else and get a Kindle Reader? Why would anyone waste their money on this substandard tablet with poor graphics? Want a non-reflective screen? Put a filter on you tablet. The edges of the characters are not smooth and the look gives me eye strain, which is exactly opposite of it's intent. $160 for this reader with 8 GB that's actually 5+ GB and takes about 10 minutes to connect to wifi?

No thanks, I'll stick to my $60 tablet that's blazing fast by comparison, with far better graphics and far more memory."
Dorinne R. Dobson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using the Kindle as a reader for years. In fact, this is my fourth reader, second Paperwhite. The first thing that impressed me was the battery does not go down nearly as fast as my old Paperwhite. It's a little slimmer, so the old cover did not fit it, but I found a beautiful new cover that is more fun and not expensive. The transition from my old Paperwhite to the new one was seamless with absolutely no problems."
dreamer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this product because of the extra space and the audiobook compatibility.
I like the fact that I can listen to my Audible audio books on my Kindle now, but I miss the possibility of reading along the audio book, as it's possible in my Audible app. Also the battery seems to last less long than on my former Kindle Paperwhite, even when switch both wifi and Bluetooth off. I like the extra space and water resistancy as I read a lot in the bath tub."
C. A. Larsen,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got a new Kindle more than year ago (when my beloved old kindle finally went to silicon heaven) so I could read books while traveling or at the gym. Unfortunately, I decided to try and save a few dollars and selected the option that was ok for advertisements, I have not been able to get past the advertisements to read a single book. It's light weight and has an impressively long lived battery when you never can use it. Every time I try to pick it up and read one of the many free books I've downloaded I get so frustrated by all the ads and random crap I never actually get to read a book."
Eskimozzi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought I’d ever replace my phone with Kindle but I’m glad I did. It certainly helps me focus on reading more books and not be distracted by all the notifications from my phone. Sure I can turn those notifications off but chances are I won’t. Battery life seems ok for me, I have it for about a week now and have been using it for about an hour or two each day and downloaded a few books, the battery is now at 48%. It was charged only once and it was on the first day I got my Kindle. The weight and size is perfect for me. Overall I’m pretty happy with this purchase."
Alison Polich,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There are only two things I was a little disappointed in. 1. It is way heavier than I expected. 2. it stated ""A single battery charge lasts weeks, not hours"". I don' know if I just read more that most people but I've had it since June 14th in now July 3rd and I've had to charge it five times and it is down to 13% power again today. I really like every thing else about it, and I love being able to adjust the font size. Some days even with my glasses being able to make the font size bigger helps."
RPNY67,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The unit is great. However, my old one died about 6 months after the warranty ran out. I was not at all happy that I had to purchase a new unit to replace it."
"ray Roanoke,Va",1.0 out of 5 stars,Had for 90 days and would not download books on wifi. Returned and Amazon sent me a refurbished unit that has more problems. I told Amazon person since it was only 90 days. I should get a new replacement. The new one light is dim. Has other issues. Don't buy..
Gliderider,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this kindle !! Have had it a little under a year.. Great battery life !! To help battery last for weeks turn off WiFi when not down loading books. Nice light weight ! Can even read in the dark. I turned my background
light totally off I prefer it that way plus I am sure that also helps battery life. Only thing I wish was different was the off button being on the bottom it gets bumped often while I read and turns my kindle off by accident. Would
Be better if it was on top."
MikeW,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the portability and selection of titles available for the Kindle. So far I've been satisfied with those available for free via Prime reading. I find that I am reading more than I used to and it's been a pleasure that I've missed.
A minor quibble: it would be nice if the device were just a bit larger; it's the size of a small paperback and I find I am turning the page often when I enlarge the font. Then again, the extra weight and size might make it less ergonomic. It would also be cool to have a case that's also a stand."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it!! I am an avid reader and personally have never owned a kindle so I can't compare to previous models, however this is soo convenient! It's small enough to fit right in my purse or jacket pocket. I now don't have to worry about shelf space, not to mention I find some books are a little cheaper to buy through Kindle than to buy in paper back. I'm sure I'll still purchase the occasional book just because I do love the feel, smell, look of an actual book, but this was definitely worth the money!"
Malou,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It was a little bit of a learning curve going from an old, original kindle to this. I kind of miss the side buttons for turning pages, but its it's nice. Its really nice having a back light! Now I can read in the dark and the screen is matte still so I can still read it out in the sunlight without any glare."
Quilp,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Paperwhite deserves 5 stars except for Kindle's charging port which is antiquated, problematic and cheap especially considering the reader's cost. The micro charging ports makes it difficult to insert the cable and frequent charges will eventually distort the female adapter over time making your investment worthless. Hopefully, Amazon's R&D will modify the charging port and cable with something similar to a 30-pin head."
Alberto,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Paperwhite, I wanted the audible feature, love it! I have been a kindle devotee since the first one came out. Great product, can’t imagine reading EBooks any other way. The only thing better is that it would offer color for its cover and illustrations a book may have."
sunshine21,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a very good kindle product and got a very good deal here . It is quite lightweight and though small fits perfectly in my purse . The night light works very nicely and provides just enough light . The only problem I had is with the page flipping . Since you have the touch screen flipping the pages get flipped many chapters ahead sometimes . Also the navigation is a bit dicey and it really needs to be improved . I think the newer version with the page flipping button on the side is going to be my next buy .
B,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought it last December, lasted 4 months. Now it has quit working, I can no longer turn it on even though it's fully charged. Nothing like finding that out right after I bought a Kindle book.
Edit - Amazon tech called me within minutes of submitting this with one star, had me do a hard reboot. (Which I had already tried but I didn't know it takes 40 seconds on a Kindle) Tech didn't know the cause but did give me some logical theories. Kindle came back on and now appears to be working but time will tell. I'm taking it on a trip and I'm hoping it doesn't die on me again. So I'm up-starring my review from one to three stars."
Ron,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm old school, liking the feel of a book, newspaper, magazine, etc. Buddy loaned me his Paperwhite for an e-book he knew I was interested in. Loved the functionality and ease of use. Wife saw my liking of this and bought it for my birthday. Have been pleased ever since. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is my questions surrounding authors getting appropriate compensation for e-books."
pc,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved the previous version of the paper white - but when I saw this one up close at the Amazon physical store in Manhattan, I knew it was time for an upgrade. The screen is smooth so it is so easy to wipe clean - no beveled edges to trap dust, etc. Even though my old paper white worked perfectly, I have to admit, the battery wasn't holding a charge like it used to. I am super happy with my purchase - I am in love again with my kindle!"
jill kunz,2.0 out of 5 stars,"2 thumbs down on the Waterproof Kindle. After reading many reviews and being leery, I decided to go ahead and purchase it. I was concerned about battery life and after reading multiple reviewers suggestions to keeping the kindle on airplane mode during use, I still find the battery doesn’t last as long as my previous Kindle Paperwhites. However, my biggest issue with this Kindle is the touchscreen often gets stuck and I need to restart it and the back light is so different from the others. Shortly after receiving this Kindle I started getting migraines and it is obvious that my headaches are coming from the lights on the Kindle. The backlight is so bright that it hurts my eyes at night and I find it impossible to read. When I called customer service (it was past the time the item was eligible for return) I was told that my new paperwhite was eligible for buyback. I was sent the paperwork to start the buyback process but my 10th generation kindle is not being bought back at this time. Really disappointed in this purchase. As a longtime Amazon customer I wish Amazon would have taken care of this for me"
Charm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love!! LOVE!! Owning this kindle!
I am a first time kindle user&owner, if you are looking to get your 1st kindle, don't look any further!
I wish I could've gotten it sooner to read all my books. Super relieved to have the water resistance since I'm always on the move and we've had some rainy weather. Did not want my actual books damaged for the rain.
Super compact and light weight that I now carry it EVERYWHERE!
**CRITIQUE: The only wish I had for the built in light to have a warm light option instead of only a bright light.
Otherwise! I absolutely love all of it!"
shopper,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't tried out the waterproof feature and have no use for the audio feature or Bluetooth but otherwise not much different than my 2015 voyage. I liked my old one slightly better but it was periodically not lighting up when turned on and swiping didn't always work right so it was time to replace it.
Battery life is about 7 - 10 days if I leave it in airplane mode. I average an hour or two of reading every day. If the wifi is on, I loose about 5% of the battery life in less than 30 minutes. Not many case available."
Laura Grow,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am beyond disappointed! I have an older version that I love! So, I bought one for my Dad and love the 32GB size so he has the option to listen to Audio Books.
I can't believe how SMALL the screen is! It might be better if it went from edge to edge, but it doesn't. The actual readying screen is 3.5""W x 5""L. It is not a 6 inch screen. When I adjust the text to the appropriate size for him, he will only be able to read a sentence or two! Whatever happened to the large sized kindle?"
Emily,5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE my kindle paper white. It’s not too bright when you are reading at night. It’s easy on the eyes. It’s a big difference going from reading on my phone to the kindle. The battery life last for a pretty long time. I have had it for about 2 or 3 weeks and have charged it once or twice. I would recommend this product to anybody one that is looking for an e-reader.
valley9,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love tbe Kindle Paperwhite. The only reason I havent given it 5 stars is that I havent used this one long enough. The light makes reading at night easy and comfortable. The battery life is very good, as long as you keep wifi turned off except for when you are downloading and syncing. I can also adjust the font size to suit my eyes. All this adds up to a wonderful reading experience. Pair it with a case that has a hand strap and you are all set."
nola_gal,3.0 out of 5 stars,I was surprised and disappointed that the device does not support continuous scrolling.
Tom,2.0 out of 5 stars,I love my new paper white but what a stupid place to put power button. The paper white is awesome in so many ways but to put the power button we’re you would put your hand is just dumb. You got the whole top with nothing there but they put the button right on the bottom and sure enough I turn it off without even knowing. Terrible design and I see that many have said the same thing. I put a sticker by it now in red so that I try to keep my hand away. Love the paper white but STUPID place to put the on/off button. Again nothing on top and that would have been a great place for it.
Jennye Hyatt,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horribly disappointed in this ""new and improved"" paperwhite. The lighting is not as well done as the previous generation and looks harsher therefor hurts your eyes more. The screen DOES glare and picks up fingerprints terribly.

But the worst part is their new audible function. The whole reason I bought this kindle was to listen to audible while reading my e-book at the same time. You can only do this if your e-book is also purchased from amazon as well as the audible book. So my huge library of e-books I got elsewhere are useless. I STILL have to use two separate devices to listen to audible while reading or spend even more money buying books through amazon that I already have! Basically their audible function works like youtube. You can't minimize the app then open your book because it immediately stops playing audible.

Horribly disappointed about this. The whole reason I purchased was to move from needing to devices to read down to one and it won't do that. Returning it to use my previous version kindle and my phone like I was doing before."
Danny Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since this is my first Kindle, I am not able to write a broad review. However, I want to address the USB issue that I and others have plugging in the micro end. When I compared the micro end to the one on another cable, I noticed that it was slightly ""taller"". With a pair of pliers, I was able to squeeze it so that it would fit.

Since Amazon offered a free replacement cable, I also ordered it. Look at some of your emails about the Kindle you purchased and you will likely find a link to order a replacement cable.

My star rating is based solely on my initial setup and use."
Lisa K,3.0 out of 5 stars,I love that a can travel with lots of books in a small package. However very very disappointed in the bluetooth connection. It says it is connected by the time you switch to the book to listen it disconnects from the bluetooth device. I had it right beside the bluetooth devise an tried several times with the same result. Says and shows a connection until you get to the book. Don't know if it is a defect or poor design.
Tonya S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I think the people writing negative reviews are REALLY nitpicking. I had the original Paperwhite and I upgraded to this one in December 2018. The waterproof feature is what really sold it for me. I have a pool and love to read on a float or in the pool itself. Plus long relaxing baths without worry. For the people who complain about battery life, TURN ON AIRPLANE MODE. Without using the wifi, the battery lasts much longer and you really only need a connection when you're browsing or downloading books. I love the flush front and the backlight too. I'm 100% satisfied with my upgrade."
Jeremy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Got the 10th Gen Kindle Paperwhite for Xmas and have read three books using it so far. It's a nice little device, but I'm not in love with it. I expected an advanced/intuitive, just plain better, operating system. This one is so-so. I have to re-orient myself every time I want to do something OTHER than read a book; like browsing for books or configuring settings.

The absolutely infuriating thing about this Kindle is the placement of the power button on the bottom edge. When holding the Kindle one-handed the button is exactly where I want to rest my pinky finger to steady/lock the device in my hand. I have accidentally turned off the Kindle numerous times.

For a 10th generation device I expected way better UX and UI and all I got was disappointment. Bezos has billions and we get Kindles that don't seem to be user tested before production.

Final grade: Meh"
debra mumson,3.0 out of 5 stars,Stated on sight it had cellular connectivity but does not. Called customer service and was told it doesn't and need to upgrade at a cost of $120.00 more. Bait and switch. Unhappy but can't afford to upgrade so am stuck with product thats less than advertized or none at all. This is for a quadriplegic that l I ves in the country with no wifi and going to town to download is a severe inconvenience. Shame Amazon shame. False addvertizing at it's lowest.
Katherine N. Hackett,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Once I figured out how to put library books on it (MUCH easier to do via laptop than trying to do it from the Kindle), I was all set (I'm a book READER not a book BUYER). The battery lasts a good long time for me and I like being able to read it in sunlight or darkness. I wish that it had a button for page turns (but not enough to pay extra for the Oasis though) and I feel like the touch screen is kind of tricky to navigate (NO! I wanted to turn the page, not look up a word in the dictionary!). Overall, I really like it and I think I'll be using it for a long time."
GavinsMom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just needed a paperback size tablet to read some books. I was using my phone. My eyes were getting tired. I've been using this for a week now, my eyes are much happier. It's slightly smaller than a paperback, but I dont' care. It's super light. Easy to read. I haven't adjusted type/font at all, so I don't know how easy that is, but I assume it's no issue. I'm so happy with this, I've already read two books, on my third."
Alice M. Grove,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Kindle was one of the earliest models. I must admit that it took some time to get used to the Kindle Paperwhite but now that I have used it for a few weeks I am thoroughly enjoying the new innovations. It is light weight and easy to handle. I can carry it anywhere. The light feature seems to work in every kind of light and that is appreciated. Very, very nice and I am so happy I upgraded to the Paperwhite."
Roosevelt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle paperwhite and I had been debating for a some time to get one or not. I had been reading ebook from an iPad but i noticed that my eyes get tired easily even though I turned down the brightness to the lowest setting possible. With the kindle, do not experience the eye strain on long readings."
softrun,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a previous generation kindle paperwhite. This one is slightly faster and has slightly better resolution, so decent incremental improvement. Unfortunately, what good is having a kindle that you can use in the sun, when it tell you it is operating above its design parameters and will shut itself off? It was a beautiful day, here in New Mexico, and only 90 degrees. I had no trouble sitting in the sun, but this kindle couldn't handle the heat. Same thing happened about about a week later."
janet walsh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the fact that I can read in bed without needing a light on. It is very lightweight and so far the battery is lasting. I am still getting used to it, took me a day to figure out how to change font (I'm not tech savvy at all) and I really do prefer the listing of books on my first Kindle. This one seems to take a longer time to go through the list because instead of just the book & author, it shows the book cover."
Tex,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When you open, instead of turning on, you have to press a very small button at bottom of unit. Then it says ""waking up"". Then doesn't go my book I'm reading. Have to go to library and click on my book. Too complicated. My old Kindle just opened when I opened cover nd went immediately to my book.

PLUS I had to renown my entire library including the most recent I ordered for future reading.

An atrocity. battery doesn't last any longer than my old Kindle. DON'T ORDER !!!!!!"
Jeffrey A Segall,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted this to be able to read books by the pool. I had been using my first generation Kindle outside but I was always afraid of the ""splash potential"". My color version and all other tablets I tried to use outside had too much glare.

So far, I have only used this inside but it is quick, synched almost effortlessly the first time with my wi-fi, a current book I was reading and with a pair of bluetooth headphones. I'm anxious to get outdoors on a sunny day. By the way, you can use this in the dark without a supplemental light source.

A couple of instructions on turning it on and off and a more accurate battery indicator would be helpful but after a week, I still haven't needed to recharge and I use it daily."
Pamela Perrotte,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite is adequate. I am not sure why it costs so much, where you can usually buy a kindle for a quarter of the price and it does so much more. The touch screen is a little touchy, the battery life is long but I don't think as long as quoted. It is lightweight and easy to travel with. You do not get a charging cord, but must purchases separately which just doesn't seem right. I do love that they added a built in light"
Steve Groves,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had an entry level Kindle for several years now and have been happy with it, but was intrigued by the new paper white version. I really like the fact that the screen is lighted, so can I read it in the dark. The extended battery life is also a plus, as is the much larger memory. Amazon named this new Kindle as ""Steve's 2nd Kindle"" and downloaded all of my more than 250 titles on to it, while keeping them installed on my 1st unit, so now I have 2 sets of titles!"
Mark G. Jones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a Kindle so I could make use of Kindle Unlimited to sample a lot of ebooks. I don't like that I have less control over how it displays things than I do with my Kobo ereader (which I still use). In fact, I have less control overall than I do with the Kobo ereader. I don't like that the power button is on the base of the Kindle so if I try to rest it on a hard surface while reading, it will sometimes turn off unintentionally.

When a book isn't restricted to Kindle Unlimited, if I buy the book, I will buy it in ePub format (which the Kindle doesn't support), and I will buy it from a non-Amazon site that doesn't use a proprietary DRM-wrapped format, so i can save it in Calibre. If I can't back it up and OWN it without DRM restrictions, I won't buy it."
JFC369,3.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life is very short. Does not last a week. Hard to read titles of books under new presentation shows book cover. Hard to read title etc my kindle 2 is much better. What a waste of money. It appears that I must pay for directions on how to work kindle. Usually when you purchase a product it includes direction component at no charge. Will fined it difficult to consider an upgrade in the future. Shame on Amazon
Waleed,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So let me start by saying this is my FIRST e-reader. I expected it to be more like a tablet, but Once I realized that it wasn’t broken (lol) it didn’t bother me anymore. Very easy to use, battery lasts a good amount of time, and the light is bright enough without hurting ur eyes. I primarily use this to read books I’ve downloaded from the library - it came with 3 months of kindle unlimited and I wasn’t impressed with the selection."
Pierre LeBear,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The user interface has not improved in years. You can grow the text size for reading but the menus and page numbers stay tiny. In the left lower screen you can tap to page, time left in chapter, etc. But it is not very touch sensitive. In the older Kindle you access the light adjustment at the top. Now you have to dive down a couple of menus. Pictures are still just as badly rendered - not expandable much. Poorly done."
Kai,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Kindle.

I've had my Kindle Paperwhite for a month and a half now and I'm very satisfied with my purchase. It got me back into reading. A hobby I let fall to the side after Uni. I've already finished 6 books since getting it.

Display is crisp. Device is light. I just take it everywhere.

Battery is satisfactory. With my settings of low brightness (off when there is considerable sunlight), Airplane Mode and reading for 4 plus hours every day - I'm getting about a week's worth of battery life.

I don't advise getting it at full price though. For that kind of money, just get a Kobo Clara HD instead. At least at $120, Kobo offers you warm light options. Get with the program Amazon. (Water proofing over warm light, really!?) Only consider a Kindle if you are already immersed in the Amazon ecosystem."
StephenDA,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love reading on this vs my phone or table.
I charge it less than one a week. I happened to be reading in direct sun the other day and had no issues seeing the screen. I would have given it a 5 star review if not for, as I have read in other reviews it is easy to hit the power button as you are reading and put it into sleep mode; however, as time is going by and I become use to this small issue it is occuring less frequently."
Scarlette,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this latest kindle; because I have run out of space for my books. While I have always enjoyed holding a real book in my hand, underlining and making notes in the margin,..... unfortunately that is no longer possible. I downsized when I moved; and had to give away my amazing collection of classics, Nobel Prize winners, ..... So on to the modern world.
What I love is that I will no longer need to take 4 or 5 books with me when I travel!!! I have just saved on the space, weight in my suitcase. For that reason alone, it was well worth purchasing. On top of that the ebooks are less expensive."
Crashmorgan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to have a ""tablet"" style e-reader that did much, much more than just a e-reader. But I didn't like it, especially because of the glare. And the battery life was awful. I switched to the Kindle Paperwhite in hopes the screen would appear more like an actual page with no glare. The Paperwhite has outperformed my expectations in that area. I have taken it outside in the brightest sunlight and could read the pages just fine with no glare at all. In fact it performed best outside with the back lighting set to zero. Battery lasts well over a week with heavy use. I am very happy with the purchase and with switching products."
LHG,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was resistant to getting an electronic reader, I like paper books. However, I have been reading SO much more since I got this. I can read at night without bothering my husband or worrying about blue light. I keep it on the lowest light possible, and believe it or not, i wish i could make it darker- if I could make it darker I would give it 5 stars! I love that it is waterproof; i have been comfortable to read when I take a bath and not worry about water. I highly recommend for anyone who loves to read."
Mary Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing. This is my second Paperwhite, because I thought that I lost my first one. The Lazyboy ate and spit it out last week. My first one is few years old and it still works great. My only complaint is that if you need to see color pics or graphics then the fire or your smart phone is probably a better device as a reader. I did spend the extra money for the ad free. With that said, Kindle's ads are not intrusive. They merely appear as a screen saver page and are only for new books."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this kindle for my husband. He was using one of my kindle fire to read his books. He is not computer savvy in any way! I was continuously having to help him find he's page or he would lose the book in the library. This kindle paper white has eliminated all of those problems and is simple for him to read a book and I can continue my own business without having to stop and fix his problem! Yea. It is a great purchase.
Jan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, it replaces an old Kindle keyboard, which I loved, and still do. I like the keyboard format better, it downloads anywhere and it's easy to navigate. The Paperwhite is smaller and more portable, it's also backlit, whichI like. Thought I'd never get all my books downloaded; it had to restart itself after EVERY SINGLE BOOK!!!!, until it decided to update itself. Not the best experience I've ever had, and no live person to help me along. Be wary."
Kathryn R. Kuzior Lindhe,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an old Kindle that still works quite well for me, however my young daughter wanted one of her own so we ordered this on Prime Day. We haven’t used it much yet, but I was quickly disappointed to find this model does not include cellular. The way the description reads, it seems it does, however it’s not even included as an option - you have to do a separate search on Amazon for a Paperwhite with cellular. This particular model allows you to choose 8gb or 32gb, with or without special offers, and with or without Kindle Unlimited but bafflingly you need to go seek out the cellular version on a separate search. Given the fact that I chose this model over the cheaper one mostly for the cellular feature, I’m quite disappointed. The waterproof feature isn’t of interest to me as I purchased the extended warranty, and she will never download enough books to hit 4gb, let alone 8gb. Customer care told me they are hearing this complaint regularly so it’s curious that Amazon continues to let this misconception continue instead of being quite clear about the features of this product. I love Amazon and Amazon products but this is a misstep on their part."
K. Mclemore,5.0 out of 5 stars,Have had several Kendles before and enjoy convenience and handling. Newest is not significantly better except for storage( way more than necessary) and Bluetooth for Audible which I really enjoy because I don’t want downloaded audible books using up memory on my other devices. Only minor negative is that battery life shortened from forever to just a longtime. Overall recommended especially if you can find it on sale.
Shoe lover,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had at least five kindles and have always loved them!! This latest one fits my needs perfectly!! I read about 2-3 hours a day and the battery still lasts over one week. I really like the new turquoise color. The touch screen is easy to use and the built in light is perfect for reading in low light or in the dark. I think this kindle is the perfect reading device and I love it!!!!! I highly recommend it!!!
N,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not a person who normally reads from an E-Reader. I look at a screen for the majority of the day so the last thing I want to do is read from a screen at the end of the day. I prefer a standard book but I have enjoyed using an E-Reader. The Paper White has come in handy when traveling or just something to read as I'm on the go (Dr's office, coffee shop, etc).

The Paper White was given to me as a gift and at that time my primary concern was the size of the screen. I quickly adapted to the smaller page/screen and weight. I would prefer a 7'' or greater option but I think having a cover helps the feel and weight of the product.

I will continue to read traditional books but there is a time and place for the Kindle Paper White in my reading routine. I'm glad I have the product."
Mike,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is very much like the previous version except water proof (I haven't tested that yet). This new Kindle version is very slightly thinner and fits in the old case with a little slop. It also needs less charging and charges faster. It has one little quirk, it makes you wait for about 5 seconds while its waking up. Its probably a power saving feature. But 5 seconds and then a couple hours of reading, seems fair."
MissyMouse,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this thing. I travel a fair amount and I can bring tons of books with me wherever I go. The screen is easy to read in a dark room or in the bright of day. The battery lasts forever (weeks) and if you do some digging you can find books for a buck or two all day long. I even take this to church to look up verses during the sermon!
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I buy this device to help focus on a document and eliminate distractions, why in the good lord’s name is amazon STILL trying to market to me when I’ve aleady bought the device? Shouldn’t the KINDLE logo be on the BACK SIDE to market to those who AREN’T already holding it in their hand? I now have to go buy black tape to cover the word KINDLE so i can focus on the text I actually WANT to read.

And the settings! It’s like the menus were designed by an unpaid student or someone who asked the wrong person for feedback or someone who feared losing their job. It’s shite! I had to read a TUTORIAL on where to switch it to LANDSCAPE MODE."
nancy s hildebrand,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't appreciate the constant advertising for books on the screen....it's very annoying. I resent paying $120 so Amazon can advertise books . I'm a reader; I don't need suggestions from Amazon. I get my reading list from friends, from the NYT Book Review , the Washington Post, the New Yorker, the New York Review of Books and my local independent book store.
The interface is not as friendly or capable as the older kindles. Access to one's library is not as friendly or readable and surfing back and forth from the index to text is not as obvious. the features added in the newer kindle are for Amazon's benefit not the readers."
Mat,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an almost perfect E-reader. The one thing holding it back is that you need a light to turn on the light as it's control is not immediately available on tapping the top of the touch screen. So you have to be able to see to touch the top of the touch screen so you can open the settings to turn on the light to see the screen. OR and I prefer this option, Turn the light on the lowest setting whenever the menu opens by touching the top of the touchscreen."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,I received my first kindle and it froze during the start up process. The same thing happened to the not one but two replacements they sent me. Ontop of that they couldn't figure out why their product wasnt working. Their only trouble shooting was hard restarting it and then sending it back. 10/10 would not recommend buying a kindle of any kind. Just download the phone app and save yourself the headache.
Mary Ann Walter,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had to buy a new Kindle as someone stole mine from the hospital where I am a volunteer (grrrr). I bought the new one which is waterproof but that wasn't a big deal to me as I don't take it around water anyway. BUT I love my Kindle and would not be without it! My first reader was a Nook and it would overheat and the battery was always having to be recharged. With this new Kindle I'm going on two weeks now with out charging the battery and I ready every day for at least 1 hr to 1.5 hrs. Frankly I wouldn't be without it!
MattB,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst Kindle ever!! I’ve had to replace two of these in 7 months. The battery wouldn’t keep a charge. I charged it up to 100% the next day after maybe an hour of use it was at 12%. Called Amazon they had me try all of these things to fix it. Didn’t help at all. While I’m on hold the battery continues to drop charge while it’s plugged in trying to charge. They told me to give it 24 hours and it should charge. I told them it’s losing charge now while it’s trying to charge. So they sent me a replacement. It did it again, I got on the phone again with Amazon and asked if I could be credited my account for the Kindle and just put the money towards an Oasis and pay the difference. They said I had it been too long and I said your battery life is horrible on the new paper white. The old paper white was fantastic!! This is probably the worst Kindle I have ever owned and I have owned multiple kindles. Beware if you are considering purchasing one."
Cmkb0102,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After waiting what seemed like forever to get a new Kindle, (we already have 6 in our family), I was very disappointed. It took forever for it to turn on the first time. Then it would not turn on at all. I went through 2 weeks of trying to get the kindle on and off and only after repeatedly hitting the on button about 25 - 30 times would it come on. I hated the backlit screen, I could never get it just right. I have returned it and will stick with my original Kindle which still works just fine."
Chris J.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just upgraded from my 10-year old Kindle. The light is great - can be adjusted to dozens of different levels until you find the exact amount of light you need. The device is also faster than my old Kindle and seems thinner and lighter. The only issue I have is that there is no real ""frame"" to it like my old one, so sometimes if I'm holding it I will turn the page before I am ready to by accidentally touching the edge of the screen. Overall I would highly recommend it!"
Elle Albrecht,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had it for a month now. Very glad I purchased it. I appreciate the many font and text style options. Can even save multiple styles and flip between them. The screen is well lit and reads fine even in total darkness.

Glare is never a problem. I tested outside under a blue sky at noon. Glare is only noticeable at a very specific angle if you're purposefully trying to reflect the sun. Easy to just not do this.

Advertisements are not a problem. I expected them to be annoying based on comments in other reviews. The ad is an artfully drawn still picture on the lock screen, usually with one line of text like 'save 50% on mystery novels'. Maybe I'd rather have a selfie with my family on the screen, but yeah.

The on-device store interface is a little sluggish and hard to navigate compared to PC web browsing. It's manageable if I'm looking for a specific book or as a last resort when on-the-go. The device automatically syncs with my web purchases so I don't have a reason to use the device store. To be clear, it is only the store that is sluggish, which I think has to do with the number of images.

Battery life has been great. I cautiously turned off wifi after downloading my purchases. No reason to keep the device connected. So far haven't needed to think about charging it."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the new Kindle Paperwhite. Everything works as expected. I didn’t think the screen being flush all the way through would make a difference, but it just feels better. The only thing I haven’t figured out is the function to have the regular books dictated through my Bluetooth headphones. I have my audio books working just fine, but whenever I try to use my headphones with a regular book it doesn’t seem to work. Other than that, I have loved the experience. The light, touchscreen, and battery life all work as described."
Lynda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the built in back light. Though I'm not sure what the special offers are. I guess I have to read the guide.
I'm very disappointed that it doesn't automatically download the book. I have to remember to download it after it appears in my list. My other older Kindle did that for me. And I just now found out that all the other books I have in my older Kindle get automatically transferred to the the paperwhite but I now have to download those books. Not nice Amazon."
A Combs,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ""upgraded"" to the Kindle Paperwhite because it was waterproof; had a battery that lasted for weeks; and could be connected to Bluetooth earphones. In truth, earphones cannot connect if there if a microphone in them, and the battery life is very disappointing. I contacted Amazon about this issue and was told that I cannot use a cover on it because when the cover is closed, the battery will run - even when I turn the Kindle off before closing the case. I travel frequently with my Kindle and need to use a cover to protect the screen. The instructions say the battery will not be used when the screen saver is on, but this is not always true. The battery runs down even when I have not used it for several days. I love reading on my Kindle but this one does not actually live up to its claims. I just hope I never have to find out if it is truly waterproof."
Edward S. Soch,3.0 out of 5 stars,"In November or 2018 I made the mistake of using the upgrading incentive and traded my old Kindle for the new Generation 10. This new Kindle e-reader is not up to Amazon’s high standards.

First, the pages turn without touching the screen. Pressure on the case will change pages.

Second, the home page does not open to My Library. It is an extra step to get to the books that I want to read

Third, now when I open the case it goes to a waking up page before I can swipe to open the reader. Again, it’s an extra step that my old reader didn’t do.

Fourth the clock loses time and I constantly have to manually adjust it.

Fifth, not all cases that say they are for Generation 10 will fit the reader. The case that I was able to find is chipping and has sharp corners.

Amazon has worked with me and sent a new reader thinking the first one was defective but I continue to have the same problems.

When charging the green light says it is fully charged it is not. Always check the percentage show on the home page."
ctshopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Kindle Paperwhite (having lost my original which was already several years old). I cannot say enough good things about it! Lightweight, clear in sunlight (great for long car rides), easy to use, and as a replacement this new one was seamless in syncing with my library. I read books daily using iPad, iPhone and Kindle and can pick up the last page read immediately from one device to the other. Buy one and enjoy!"
Suzanne G.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I still have a hard time finding what I want to read from my Library. Sometimes the book opens not at the beginning.
It told me the first time I used the new Kindle that it was too hot and will turn off shortly. I immediately went to shade and continued to read. I did not have this problem with the first Kindle that is still good to use. I would like all books that I ordered to be read on both Kindles. When I ordered the new Kindle, Sylvia said she would call me and show me how to find things. She has not called me. I could use some help. I am 76 years old."
lilangelsmom,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have always loved the Kindles! The Paperwhite was my first one and I have had 2 others since then. I love to read so I put them to the test!! I chose this paperwhite model because I don't need a Fire and the size is perfect to fit in my purse and take everywhere. The built-in light is great for reading in bed when your partner just wants to sleep. It is worth the money and I love that it is waterproof/resistant.
sugarlandtx,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third kindle paperwhite and I am not disappointed. I really like it. It is smaller and much lighter than the previous generation. I have arthritis in my wrists, so the lighter the device, the better. I use audible so this is a nice feature. I don’t plan on using my kindle in the water, but if I do then it’s waterproof. I’m glad that I bought the new paperwhite!"
TED ADAMS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Print size, lighting, getting around the device and many other things are excellent and very helpful. I recommend it for a small device to read by as it is easy to handle and look at. I don't think anyone will be disappointed with this device."
Keith Gallagher,5.0 out of 5 stars,There’s nothing not to like about this kindle The battery life is awesome I Put it in airplane mode when I’m done downloading my last Kindle Left it on the plane never got it back I haven’t tried reading in the rain but it should work great kindles are awesome many different fonts and adjustments on the back light great buy definitely recommend
G. Mix,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the kindle for ease of reading and the adjustments for font family and size. It's great that I can read it in bright, low, or no light. This is my 5th kindle (because I wear them out). I'm not too keen on the placement of the on/off button at the bottom of this version of the Kindle. It inadvertently gets turned off while holding it. The annoying button placement is the reason I gave it a 3, otherwise I'd give it a 5."
pushing50,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a person who loves the physical experience of book reading. I like holding them, falling asleep with them mashed under my cheek, turning pages - so I was intensely skeptical. But my Kindle experience has been transformative. No more struggling to find good light to read by. No more forgetting book recommendations- I just buy them on the spot. Font enlargement when my peepers are tired, huzzah! Looking up unfamiliar words with the touch, LOVE THAT! Get it. You want regret it."
Tod Glenn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"While I already own an iPad, I wanted a dedicated reader that was small, light and had a long battery life. The Kindle paperwhite exactly fulfilled these requirements. While functionality is limited to books and audible content, it's perfect for travel and i don't have to plug it in every night. I go weeks between charging, reading several hours per day.

I haven't tested the waterproofing, but otherwise have been using it a lot. The tight integration with amazon makes buying content easy."
krzysamm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have really enjoyed having the paper white kindle. It is light weight, easy to carry along, and it easy to hold for long periods of time. The screen is clear, easy to read with little to no glare. I love that I can change the screen font as well as size and can make it brighter for nighttime use that suits my personal needs. Even though I have a kindle fire and love it the paper white is easier to read with a lot less eye strain. Would recommend."
Padmini Ekbote,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's better than the old Kindle White. Faster at downloading, turning pages is easier, it opens and closes when I open it shut my cover."
Ruth A Ijames,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a replacement for my older one that I left on a plane while on a recent trip. It fits my need, which is to be able to read my books without having to carry one. The lighted surface is what attracted me to the old one several years ago; I can read without disturbing passengers next to me. The size is just perfect. It fits in computer bag pocket or purse. Holds charge well too. Absolutely no complaints."
lana,5.0 out of 5 stars,I think the light is very important and wonderful should’ve done this a long time ago love love this tablet wonderful you could sit there at night the lights off and read crystal clear I wish it was a little bit larger but it’s perfect love it
Ajwhite,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s not actually waterproof. I used it near water twice where it was never submerged, but got some water on it. The plug in corroded and now it won’t take a charge."
Barbara Arnold,2.0 out of 5 stars,I use my kindle for reading books. I like my old kindle better. This kindle I have a hard time finding the books I want to read and how to delete them when read. My old kindle you opened the cover swiped and there are the books your reading .
barbee Carson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally an dreaded that is water proof. I have ruined 3 kindle ereaders. I dropped 2 in my sons pool. The third I was on vacation where the chairs are in the pool. It was very windy. I went to get up and had put my ereader on the table. It was resting on a angle on a towel the wind got under it and in the pool again. This one came out one week after we got home I am totally delight that it is waterproof.
Cassi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my paperwhite. I had the original and got this one as an upgrade after a few years with the old one. My only complaint is how the light works on this one compared to the old one. My old kindle had a less even light than this one, but it seemed to remember my light settings better. When I turn on the new one it comes on super bright for a few seconds and then dims to my normal setting. If I’m reading during the day it’s not too bad, but reading in bed it’s pretty blinding."
NICKy V,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new Kindle paperwhite ! I am a huge real paper book fan. I read a lot.
I resisted for a long time and I am glad that I finally gave in and bought one. Real books are heavy and I will not get rid of the ones that I have, but now I can keep them all in one place with little to no space taken up. I can read anywhere and the books are cheaper too. Easy to use and I have any book that I want right there, so I can go back and forth between books real easy."
K9,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just a Horrible piece of tech. To get a book to download, send it, restart kindle, sync, resend book, restart kindle, sync, resend book.....etc. I have to do this 4-6 times to get a book to appear on my new kindle. Plus— All the books I have deleted reappear. I currently have 8 books that I cannot get to download. I wish I had kept my old one from 2012 instead of trading it in."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my new Paperwhite 5 days ago to replace my very old Kindle. I purchased a Paperwhite for a number of reasons. It's supposed to have excellent battery life, as Amazon claims, weeks, not days. I've already had to charge my Paperwhite twice! The other thing I really hate is the new format. No longer can I look at the top 100 Best Sellers or the top 100 free. They are GONE. The touchscreen is OK, but very sensitive. I was reading a book today and somehow I ended up near the end of the book I just started reading. I ended up having to go to the beginning of the book and tapping over and over to forward through the pages to find where I left off reading. I much preferred the page turn buttons on my old Kindle. If I had it to do over, I would have purchased an Oasis since you can turn off the tap to page forwardand back and use forward and back buttons. I was told there are free or nearly free books on Amazon's web site. They may be there somewhere, but they sure aren't easy to find. I'm really disappointed with my purchase and with Amazon."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this kindle to replace an old kindle (8 years, 400 boxes) that died. Since this one is touch screen, took a bit getting use to. Love the paper white as well. With the old kindle, I had a cover which included a lamp. Lamp was OK, but really did not illuminate the entire screen. Bottom of the screen was a bit darker. With this paper white, no issues there at all. Love these Kindles for sure and for me, a very good value as I am an avid reader of fiction and non-fiction books."
Eric,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was reading on a combination of my phone and HD10. Eyestrain, weight, and battery life were definite issues that pushed me torwards finally picking up a Paperwhite.

The size and weight are perfect though it did take some adjustment to the reduction in lines per page (compared to HD10). No issues with light bleed, dead/stuck pixels, or glare. Battery life was 2 weeks of daily use and loading up my library. I expect battery life will be longer now that downloading will be less now."
avid reader,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The touchscreen seems to need me to touch more than once to get the pages turned. Also seems to inadvertently jump back a number of pages at a time some of the time. Perhaps I am not used to regulating the pressure needed as my original kindle had a button to press to advance the page. This kindle is lighter to hold and automatically turns to the page I left when I open the cover, that is nice and convenient. The light and contrast seems very acceptable, and overall i am liking my new kindle."
ONS,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the new Kindle because my old one has problem charging. Here what I do not like about the Kindle paper white 10-th generations:
Backlight. The reason I preferred reading on Kindle as opposed to iPad, is that there was no backlight, and it was easy on eyes. No more.
I like the return button. No more
I love EveryWord. No more, it cannot be download on the new Kindle.
The connection cord that came with the new Kindle cannot be used to transfer files via USB.
As far as Kindle goes, the new design is not better, though it was lauded as a superior one. In this case, the better turns out to be the enemy of the good."
Larlar818,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Im always reluctant to give 5 stars because Ive only had it for a short while but so far I love it. took it to the pool could read in the sun AND sit on the edge of the pool, watch my kids, and still not worry about getting it wet. I havent submerged it and I would never on purpose but splash wise it worked perfectly."
Jeffrey D. Herriman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have not noticed much difference in the new paperwhite. I thought the upgrade with trade in would be a good idea. Now not so much. My trade in lived in a case, next to my bed (night time reading only). After sending my old paperwhite, the trade in value went from $25.00 to $5.00. reason scratched. I have trouble with this assessment as I took great care with no damage at all. . I am not sure how the economics will work out. I suppose in the end an upgrade is not a bad idea."
Sandy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Slow to wake up, after a couple weeks already needed to be factory reset since it was no longer highlighting words for the dictionary/Wikipedia/translation feature. The battery doesn't last as long either. That's about it - it's not quite as good as the last one."
Tvjmike,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This product was purchased for gifting. Now she states she wanted a screen with color and ability to play games. This is only a black and white reader. Having presented it and now wishing to upgrade or refund, I am informed the return window is closed. I cannot rate this product she never used it. She is holding up some Christmas shopping waiting for this to resolve, afraid of return issues again."
Geena,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If I could give zero I would. They make you think that you purchased a brand new one because that is what you paid for and you know nowhere in the description says you are purchasing a refurbished one, only to get it defective. And when you try to have it replaced, all their off shore customer service people are irate and could not guarantee you a new one. They will always replace it with a refurbished one even if you paid and expected a brand new one. They will even use their warranty contract that it says there that they can either send you a new one or refurbished and nowhere in the contract says they can only replace a new device within thirty days. They just highlight 1 year warranty with the product and have the option to either give you a new or refurbished but they will never give you a new one. It makes you think if they are even making news ones or just circulating all refurbished ones and sell them as brand new."
Kevin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third personal kindle, cracked the screen on the first. The other two fell into the tub. Might not want to take this one swimming, but for minor water mishaps, it should do very well. Really like the flat screen and the upgrades."
RKg,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I discovered after a few days, I really did need to read the kindle instructions. I like how easy it is to turn pages by barely touching the screen. This can also be a negative as I discovered you can accidentally go forward a couple pages at a time without intending to. It would be nice if there was a quick start guide that came printed with the kindle. Either all books don't come with a table of contents and or index or I haven't figured out how to access it on all books. I guess I need to finish reading the instructions for use."
Happy shopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very pleased with this Kindle. It's my third one, and the easiest to use. Because I have macular degeneration, it's a necessity I have a well-lighted screen; and the ability to adjust the size of the font. I use this Kindle because I am a member of a book club, and read a new book choice each month. The fact that it's waterproof gives me the extra security of knowing I can carry it even if it's raining."
Melnic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very light for comfortable reading. Great for arthritic hands. Previously read books on iPad - too heavy.
Font is easily adjustable as is backlight. Can read in sunlight, too.
Don't be fooled by small screen size -- reading/page turning is quick and easy.
Would recommend."
MissyKC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my 4th Kindle to replace one that would no longer hold a charge. My old one I could read in the sun but this one overheats while reading in the sun. I do read a lot on my E-reader but I can’t say this one holds a charge for days. It seems to drain even when not used. Wasn’t packed well, just in a box with no packing material—thank goodness it wasn’t broken."
Amanda B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is so tiny (that's good)! The box it came in is so long and skinny. I mean, I knew it was small and light and that's why I wanted it, but you could not prepare for how cute this little thing is.

The only negative I can see from the size is that the words on the screen end up being more pages but that's cool.

It fits so neatly in my purse. You can read anywhere. I love it.

I've attached a photo of the wee little thing next to my Fire HD 10 and my old Samsung Tab (I believe it's 7"") for scale."
Dustin Hoffman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought that I would enjoy reading on an e-reader. I was utterly against the idea until my ""library"" grew to be a bit overwhelming. After using it for roughly 3 days I was hooked. I dont think I will purchase a paper book again due to the convenience of being able to have multiple books with you at a time, and how surprisingly comfortable it is to use. I believe that the paperwhite is just the right price as well. The oasis seems a bit too high for my liking, and I personally find the lights in the paperwhite to be more than adequate. ALSO! Great for college students who would normally have to lug several textbooks around. Instead, if available, they can be purchased through the kindle store which makes it much easier. I would definitely recommend this to others, and urge you to give it a try."
connie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"the product itself is great, but I bought this because it was affordable, with 6 equal payments. Amazon put the entire thing on my credit card, this is the second time this has happened to me when I clearly requested the 6 payment plan, having to pay this off at one time is definitely not what I wanted to do. On the previous purchase I called and I could not get through to the person (because she spoke very poor English) that I wanted 6 payments, she had no clue what I was referring to, so don't fall for the 6 equal payment plan, you probably won't get it. Very, very annoyed...……….."
Vi P,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had called and talked to amazon before placing an order for the Kindle paperwhite that i have a lot of pdf's and wanted to ensure that would work or be converted properly, the product is good but was unhappy as the conversion of the pdf's documents is not proper, also i purchased kindle books and was very happy at the formatting. I would recommend this product who is going to purchase kindle books from amazon.

Thanks,
Virendra"
Richard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried for years to read on iPads and iPhones... but I never last long - a couple of books and I give up.

I picked up a Kindle on Prime Day for a good discount and I really love it. I should have bought one of these years ago.

It feels cheap and light, the screen is plastic, it has slow response to the touch, the user interface is pretty bad - but I still love it as reading on it is excellent."
OneReader,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This new one is super light and small. But ergonomically, it's killing me. And there's just too much going on. I want a ""book,"" not a combination do-it-all thing. The screen is both too sensitive and not enough. I often find myself many pages forward--or sometimes backward-- from what was intended as a single touch. Activating the menus is not intuitive. I'd trade for my old clunker in a heartbeat if they still supported it. :("
Kristal Dixon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE (12-8-19) Overall, I like this Kindle, despite the battery life. However, every once in a while, the screen messes up on me and I get this kind of display (see photo). This is the third or fourth time it's happened since buying it. It happened twice before I decided to spend the extra money to get rid of the ads. I have to force restart to correct the issue.

Original Review:

I had the 6th (?) generation Paperwhite that I bought back in 2014. It was a great purchase and lasted for 5 years. I only got this one because my old Kindle would freeze and the battery life was declining. Anyway, overall I like this one, but the battery life is awful. I bought this one with special offers. One day I opened the case and while it was waking up (which is another negative), the screen froze and became distorted. I was able to restart it. I decided to pay the $20 get rid of the special offers ads and haven't had any issues since. This one is easier for me to hold with one hand since it's lighter. The screen is also sharper. The $29 case I got with it is ok. It could be a little sturdier though."
gsh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This kindle was bought for me by my son and daughter-in-law when I went to visit them and my kindle would no longer hold a charge. It was such a surprise! It looks just like my old one so I was instantly familiar with the functions and buttons. But then I found out it was waterproof. Now I can read my kindle by my pool during the summer without fear of the sudden rainfalls and my scurrying to get everything under cover. LOL. Oh, and it holds a charge for a long time - over a week so far."
Robert,1.0 out of 5 stars,"With no apparent reason, the font size jumps randomly while reading. In order to return to the size I want I have to squeeze (or expand) with two fingers. This brings up the font size control screen and allows me to reset things. After a few time doing this the pleasure has gone from reading anything. I noted by internet searches that this has been an issue for some time and no one has really figured out a solution. Very disappointing!"
rduanem,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The background is brighter, the text appears sharper, it is supposed to be water proof...though I don't read in the water and the trade in value of $20 sounded reasonable. The trade in came through at $5 (pitiful) and in retrospect I would not have made the trade. Its simply not that much better than the previous version."
Sue Moro,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is super light, very responsive to touch, and the ability to read outdoors and then go and read in a dark room with the built in light feature is perfection!"
Cardiana 2003,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed a new device because I kept dropping my old one. I like this one but... it needed a software update almost immediately. It was taking FOREVER to wake up, but the update made that better. What I didn’t like was that the update wasn’t automatic.

The touchscreen is fine except that sometimes it doesn’t work right away and sometimes it goes backwards. It’s a minor irritant but an irritant nonetheless.

It work me super nice if the charger and cord were included when purchasing the device."
MP,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My Paperwhite suddenly dimmed. Even with the brightness setting turned all the way up, it is not very bright. Needless to say, this occurred one week outside of my repair warranty, so I'm stuck. It was nice while it lasted, but not a very good return on my investment. I don't plan on purchasing another. Fool me once, as they say."
Ryan S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's dated. It's not the best e-reader. 2018 model and STILL no warm light for night reading, just the glaring uncomfortable blueness of the LEDs. Sitting in dim yellow lighting, the screen will often appear green as the ambient light mixes with the blueish front light. For the price, this device is quite unacceptable, but Kindle Unlimited is too good to switch to Kobo or Nook. There are several books I'm eager to read that are only on Kindle, and I'm quite invested in my Amazon account.

I give it 3 stars because it works well enough, but it's just uncomfortable to use in low light, which begs the question of why the front-light even exists. Seriously, blue LEDs?"
Pat C,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm enjoying my new Kindle. It's light and small enough to carry anywhere so you can read anytime you have a break. Non-standard menus and terms are difficult.
Downloading ebooks from the library still must be done on a separate device using the Overdrive app and Amazon??? Cumbersome. And why did they put the on/off button on the bottom edge? I turn it off accidentally once or twice a day.
It keeps a charge for days though and has lots of page formats and fonts. It's a fun reader overall."
Simken,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Have not used the new Kindle long enough to give a full review and comparison, but it is quite different than the original Kindle. The new touch screen is a little confusing and sensitive at first. Sometime you might skip two or three pages if you touch the screen too long. Also there are three or four different spots on the screen that do different things. Other than that, its a matter of getting familiar with the setup."
MCG,3.0 out of 5 stars,"While the new Kindle has the Paperwhite touch screen, it doesn’t allow you to use the left side to page forward. The old Kindle allowed you to keep Archives totally separate from newer books not read. This one jumbled them together and only highlights few recent books. The rest of the home pages is dedicated to selling you more books. Leather cover is cheap and charger adapter didn’t fit Kindle. When I went to order a free replacement cable per their instructions as they claimed they had issues with the cable. they tried to charge me freight to replace something that was defective."
Damien,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from paperwhite 7th gen mostly because of the Bluetooth function. Unfortunately I discovered later that the device supports only audible format AAX. That was a huge disappointment for me. Pity that you cannot play mp3 or any other audio files. My bad, I did not read specs carefully.
If you don't care about waterproof feature upgrade from previous paperwhite does not make sense. In addition new kindle seems to be slower, especially during start up (never happened with older model that I needed to wait for Kindle to wake up...) Maybe it is a new firmware ""feature"";-)"
R. W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! I’m so impressed. I have had my 5th gen (?, 2012) all these years because I didn’t really want a touch screen or built in light — I wanted avoid blue light as well as annoyingly cheap touch screens. But my battery started to die too fast because I took it into saunas, which was a terrible idea.

But I’m so happy I bought this. I am thrilled to be able to read in the bath, turn off the built in light when I want, use the soft light at night rather than a harsh lamp. Battery life has been great, really. I am so happy with this purchase!"
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I should have checked the dimensions on this Paperwhite before purchasing. It is very small--smaller than a paperback book. That's not the biggest problem, though. The home screen text is sooo small and dim that I find myself avoiding reading--that's a large issue. I checked for any accessibility options but could not find any way to change text size on the toolbar & homescreen.
This is my 3rd traditional Kindle and I am rather disappointed. Gen 1 and Gen 2 Kindles were amazing--as was my first Fire tablet--but the fewer features and lack of accessibility options on the Paperwhite don't provide the reading experience I'd previously had with Kindles.
Battery life is good, but I can't see text & nav/toolbar without magnifying lens.
Do better, please, Amazon."
B. Hennings,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always enjoyed reading in the tub, so I was overjoyed when I heard Amazon had come out with waterproof Kindles. I was hesitant to try it near water at first, but I have had no issues so far. I can even relax and read I'm the tub by candle light! The only complaint I have is I have an older Kindle and the screen is closer to paper like than the paper white with less glare, but this isn't really an issue."
Jazz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t like the fact that my new waterproof kindle says “waking up” first then 5 or so seconds later says “swipe to open. I’ve had 2 other older versions and all just opened right away with “swipe”. The face is not as touch sensitive as either of my other kindle readers, sometimes I have to swipe 2 or 3 times for the page to change. Is this a defect? Thinking about sending it back. I would give my old readers a 5 ⭐️."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite things to do are read and float in water in my noodle seat. Now do both at the same time with his new waterproof Kindle. It is perfect for what I love. My only criticism is that the screen is almost too sensitive, and will change script size almost by itself. It could be that I just have to get used to how to use it, as it is my first Kindle in years because I usually use my iPad for or iPhone for reading."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, Love, Love the Kindle Paperwhite. I left my 1st one on a plane (never recovered --- hmmm) and insisted on wanting another one ASAP. My hubby surprised me with a brand new one! My old one was PERFECT as well. I guess somebody received a good deal if they found my old one while traveling on Southwest! I was sooooo sad when it wasn't found!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my new Kindle last week. I absolutely love it. I thought how could you improve on my Kindle? Well, I was shocked. The battery lasts so much longer. Page turning is so much better. The slimmer size is nicer. The new cover is much more comfortable. The only thing I don't like is the length of the electrical charging cord. I would have liked it longer. The thing that saves this, is that you don't have to charge the new Kindle as much as the old one."
Kristopher,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had every Kindle since the Kindle Keyboard. This update has the best screen ever. The new OS is slower to respond when waking up from sleep. Also, my Kindle overheats very easily while outside. 20-25 Celsius and in 10-15 minutes it says it's past it's operating temperature and is shutting down. I think when they waterproofed it they didn't allow for enough ventilation to cool the newer faster hotter processor. If you're using it in the bathtub I'm sure it'd be fine but if you want to use it pool side I'd say get a model down and just be careful about getting it wet."
Lisa B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was impressed with it. I do have to admit I liked the one I had back in 2014. It had a more user friendly main screen, if I remember correctly. I wish I knew how to look at the chapters of books when I’m reading one. I have an iPad but it hurts my eyes to read on it for a long period of time. The Paperwhite is great on the eyes and also reading outside in the sun. I was disappointed with the audible on it. I was thinking it would have speakers and not need Bluetooth."
Patricia M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For years, I've struggled reading because of my age, my cataracts, and my dry eye. I took a chance on this product because of the backlight option. I enlarged the text size (not quite to the largest option) and gave it a shot. In three weeks, I've read three novels - and so look forward to reading more. The only complaint I have is that it sometimes kicks me out of a book without warning and periodically will flash a black screen when I tap to change the page. I've had zero problems with recharging it, and the battery life is great (weeks). Very satisfied!"
Mary-Robin B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have never had an ereader before. This is my first. I really do love it. A little disappointed in the brightness but then again I have nothing to compare it to. Eyes are not good so brighter light helps. I was afraid I would miss turning the pages of a book but I don’t at all. I don’t see well enough at night with my glasses (I wear contacts during the day) to read a book in bed. I don’t like reading in my contacts in bed before turning out the light and having to get up to take them out. I can now read with my glasses and roll over and take the glasses off. It was a bedtime issue for me to read but I enjoy reading now because of the Kindle. I just ordered my mom one today. Got a great deal. I believe she will enjoy as well
Alicia Snide,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So the product is the same - i have owned 3 Paperwhite Kindles. This new model that is waterproof... the battery charging is off. When you plug it in, it some times takes forever and then sometime it's quick but it never reaches 100% charged. When the green indicator light comes on - it's not necessarily at 100 % - in the last week, i charged my device twice and once it got to 94% and today after going through support at Amazon 95%. According to Amazon Support, the green light only means that it's charged enough to use without issues..... all the devices i have had - the green light indicates fully charged.... Don't think i will buying anymore of these in the future, need to research a new reader option."
pema drolma,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I enjoy the kindle. Nice to take to bed to read, even with the lights out. I did have problems with it freezing up. I used a search engine and found out how to get it going again. Hope this doesn't happen to often. There was a problem of removing previous read books from the device."
Gretchen Walters,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall this is a great product. Although I had to get my grandson to connect it to my speaker. Two of my friends have this Kindle and love it. So I thought I’d give it a try since I love to read. However I still prefer a real paper book. There’s something about holding that book in my hands that makes it so much better. Call me old fashioned. So if you are all about electronic devices this is the Kindle for you.
Adam,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall the new Paperwhite is a great device, the ability to customize your reading preferences with layout and font and have it carry over to each book is a wonderful thing, as some book formatting changes where images are displayed.
The thing I dislike even after the recent software upgrades are the inability to have “nested” or collections inside of collections. This ability would be very helpful in sorting through all books as you can only see seven at a time in list view and six at a time in cover view.
Regarding the book covers the resolution of the screen is wonderful, just wish you could make the cover of your current book the screen saver instead of the rotating stock photos. There are methods for older Kindle models to perform both the above but the new Paperwhite is unable to support these."
StewsFarms,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Surpassed expectations. I’ve been wanting a kindle for quite sometime and finally pulled the trigger. Already up two books in 3 weeks. The touch gestures can be a little tricky and I’ve accidentally clicked my way to different spots in the book but overall great little device.

The screen is very sharp and fully visible in sunlight. I prefer to read on this over my iPad and Mac which both have excellent screens. This is softer on your eyes and better for actual reading. The battery life is incredible as well. Charged it fully before a trip 2 weeks ago and have 23% remaining. Highly recommend!"
d,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasted so much time on this kindle-a CB product I wanted for awhile. However connecting it to my WiFi no matter how many times I reset it, conducted a hard shut off was impossible. Very disappointed in the product-I do not recommend"
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that it’s waterproof, has a built in light, and long battery life (only charge once per week)! However, I don’t like that the on/off switch is at the bottom of the device where I hold it. I accidentally turn it off many times while reading, it also gets turned off when I try to prop it up on the table while Im eating. It’s super annoying. The switch should have been at the top. Also, the screen is so sensitive that the font size keeps changing every time I touch it. I actually preferred my original keyboard kindle."
ck,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle. Im still getting used to it. I dont like that its just black and white. I guess im used to everything in color on my phone. I also wish there was a way to organize my books by category. I cant figure out how to do it. It needs this feature and if it has it, it needs to be easier. I like that its light weight. Its much lighter than my smart phone. I still dont know if i like it or not."
Rebecca McCormack,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Screen size small, may exchange if possible for larger size. Nice to carry size however and battery and ease of page change good. Hopefully I can get used to small screen size, had been reading on ipad previously or old Kindle until it stopped working. And amazing how much is packed into the little device."
D. Conley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Like: feels like a book when reading. Small enough to carry around, better than a book. Dislike: hard to navigate around a book. I can't use the table of contents to go from one chapter to another. Also no page numbers. Location numbers are not useful. Also while pages turn easily other functions do not respond quickly to touch. It's a little clunky in that aspect but I much prefer it to using books."
BAM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVED my old Kindle white. However, the battery was beginning to not hold well and became very frustrating. I bought the new Kindle white that is waterproof. I charged it once, read every night for almost an hour and I still have 50% charge left after 2 weeks. I also like the fact when you close the front cover it automatically turns off and vice versa when I`m ready to read again. I bought it on the sale day in July; very satisfied with the price and the performance."
Heather L Chamblee,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The only good thing I can say about this product is how light it is and I also do like the lighting seems like it would be good for reading outdoors, if it wasn't so slow, glitchy and blurry.

It is extremely slow. I was looking for a replacement for my kindle fire which is 4 years old and this thing is much slower. You have to hit the item multiple times before it responds. It is also extremely glitchy. When it does respond the screen flashes a few time between going from one screen to another and turns black. I also find the screen a bit blurry."
Reading Diva Del,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love my paperwhite! I ordered on impulse after my K e-reader froze on me❕I was so exasperated😠😠😠until I researched the paperwork and found that it had all the features that I need with my limited mobility in my hands due to my Rhuematoid Arthritis. It is very easy for me to use and enjoy reading uninterrupted and lot less painful for .d to turn my pages!
Donna Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't know what to expect when i ordered this but it's a great compact reader for me. I love to read but hate to carry big books all the time. I have already read two books since my purchase. Used to take me longer to read one book.
Prime Member,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m the type of person who has resisted using an e-reader for a long time. Mainly because I love books and felt e-books just weren’t the same. And that’s true - this review isn’t about that. For years if I needed to use an e-reader I just used iBooks on my iPad mini and hated it, the blue light hurt my eyes and I could never read for long periods. The Kindle Paperwhite may be changing my mind on e-readers. The lighting is much much kinder to the eyes, I just finished a “test” novel that I read in a few days, often sitting for a few hours with the Kindle. It is also significantly lighter than my iPad mini and it’s pocket sized which will make traveling with it much easier than other tablet devices. It is of course strictly an e-reader, not a tablet, so no movies or other games/apps but even so I may end up leaving my iPad behind all together in the future. That’s how good it is.

The only design flaw I find is having the screen on/off button on the bottom edge, I hit it a few times accidentally while holding the device. Something on the top edge would be a little more user friendly."
Chris R,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been many, many years since I was a heavy reader and owned my last Kindle. Wanting to change that, I picked this up while it was on sale and sync'd it to my account. The setup was super simple and within a few minutes I was reading one of my Prime books! Kindles are incredibly simple to use and very intuitive. Navigating it is easy, the display is great, and it holds more books than I'll ever need!"
H. Dingui,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the paperwhite because it is just books. I like the black and white and it's easy to read design. I love that it is so light and thin. It's like having an entire library in my pocket. When I add notes after highlighting, they keyboard is not that easy to use (I think my fingers will have to get used to it). I have been wanting one for awhile and I am so glad to have one now. I really like ebooks."
Melissa,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my first kindle paper white. I have been reluctant to switch over to ebooks. My kids have kindle fires and I don’t really like reading on those. I like the lighting so much better on this. I find myself pulling this out to read on all the time now. It’s so lightweight I can just throw it in my purse and read whenever I have a spare moment. I love that there are tons of free ebooks out there too!
Daniel K.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"i went to the compare page to pick my kindle this one said it has WiFi and cellular connectivity which is nice because i live in a rural area. purchased it and it only has WiFi. when i talked to tech support the first guy said i was right it shows that, then we were disconnected(the joys of living in a rural area) the next guy referred me to the small print after the description there is 12 pt text saying we want you to know we have this model with cellular too. which is of course 130$more.(price isnt the issue if i new that upfront) would have been nice to have more than three kindles on the compare page if you have more than 3 models. very very misleading starting to lose trust in amazon"
M Rojas,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Now that I've worked my way through some initial problems, I really like this Kindle and I'm glad I bought it. But it came with no instructions at all - just a user manual on the device itself. Once you know the simple methods to bring up the menu, it's easy. But I actually to go on my laptop to google instructions so I could understand where and how to tap - it wasn't intuitive for me (so for example, I could not figure out how to get ""home"" to find the library to open the instructions on the device). My sister who has an older Kindle tried to help me but it didn't work for her either, since the Paperwhite has no ""home"" button and is different in other subtle ways. The other issue I had was that Amazon offered a promotion of 90 days of free Kindle Unlimited. I bought two Kindles for myself and my husband. But when we tried to sign up for Kindle Unlimited, we only got ONE promotion (my husband's Kindle offered 30 free days, not 90). If you buy two products, you should get the promotion on both of them regardless of whether they are purchased in the same transaction."
Tanisha McOmber,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My kindle has been the best purchase of the year. I have always been the snobby ""I like having a physical book"" person. This mostly stemmed from my eyes getting fatigued from looking at a screen at work all day and then trying to use the kindle app on my ipad. I finally broke down and decided to buy a kindle to take on my honeymoon as we were planning on spending 12 hours of travel on trains. The kindle has been a game changer. In the month that I've had it I've been able to read 6 books, its so easy to take with me. I don't have to worry about losing my spot and the screen doesn't hurt my eyes. I've switched to reading at night again and I love it!! My kindle has renewed my love of books."
Sarah Laney,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Over all I have really enjoyed my new kindle. I feel like it’s user friendly and love that it’s water proof and there is a back light!!

My biggest complaint is that the battery life SUCKS! I’m a teacher, so I’m off work during the summer. I have been reading many, many hours a day... I have to charge my kindle AT LEAST once through the day. Also I’ve notice even removing from the charger and just sitting there unused for less than an hour battery life depleted quickly. It’s just an annoyance I wish could be corrected."
Tom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like to read....a lot. This is my 4th Kindle. I tried the Fire, but the battery life didn't do it for me. The pagewhite is exactly what I want, with a battery that lasts 2 or even 3 books, the ability to scale the print size easily so I can read even when I can't kind my cheaters, and a backlit screen that lets me read in bed without a night light. I like that it is waterproof -- I've had too many electronic devices destroyed because they weren't. If you just want to read books, and not surf the web, play games, or look at pictures, then a page white reader is what you want."
Mary Ellen Rodda,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Hmm. The documentation both says to read in the tub and to take multiple steps if the Paperwhite gets wet. Maybe a ziploc bag would be wise? My attraction to this was how little it weighs, not the waterproofness. I'm very happy with how travelworthy it is."
JaneDane,3.0 out of 5 stars,I saw a couple others write that before I bought this and thought that surely they were just dramatic. They were not! I have a Kindle Paperwhite that is about 3 years old and this is hardly better than it. I would not upgrade until they make major changes. The only thing this one does better is it is slightly faster and waterproof. It is NOT thinner!
Ken,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the flush screen on this newer model a lot better. I haven't had any issues with glare on mine, but I worry about scratching the screen. I would have given it 5 stars if it had come with a basic case for protection. Would have been nice if they included the AC adapter as well.

I also noticed that this is advertised as an 8GB, but mine only shows 6GB in the settings menu, with some of that being taken up by the operating system, and default programs. I'm wondering if there's something wrong with it. I also had issues activating it. I had to contact Amazon and go through 4 different representatives before someone was able to activate it on their end."
deanna hegedus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this Kindle even more than the two I have had before. This one is lighted which is very nice when you are sharing a hotel room and want to read because you can't sleep. My others just turned on when I pushed the button. This one says ""waking up."" That tickles me every time I turn it on. I also like being able to touch a word to find the meaning. I haven't tried the audio books on this yet but I will."
Sybille C. Denninger,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love my new 2018 waterproof Kindle Paperwhite! It’s very compact and light, yet comfortable & easy to read. I had previously switched from the original Kindle version to my ipad but there was too much glare when reading outside and the ipad I have is too big to be taken everywhere. The new Kindle was easy to set up and to download the books from my existing Kindle library. The battery power lasts a long time. This Kindle will pretty much be my constant companion!"
Joseph A. DeFrancesco,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took me a little bit of time to get acquainted with the new generation Kindle reader, but now it is like second nature. I like the new features to highlight words and pages. Looking up information is quicker and page turning is more efficient. I am glad I made the change. Also, having Goof Reads connected to the Kindle is also a plus."
Jan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My old (2013, I think) Paperwhite died. Bought a new one. I preferred the slightly larger screen size of my old one. If you haven't had a Paperwhite before you won't notice. Other than screen size and slightly slower start time, it is essentially the same for my purposes. The waterproofing and storage aren't important to me. I do very much enjoy having the Kindle instead of piling up physical books. I find it very easy to read. Hope this one lasts as many years as the last one."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very disappointed with this product. It's horribly slow, and while yes, it's light, it's uncomfortable to hold for long. Want to sign up for author websites through the links at the end of stories? Don't hold your breath. I've been unable to do so, this product freezes and has to o be rebooted. Amazon doesn't support my Kindle Fire anymore, but as old as it is, (for electronics that is), the Fire is far and away Superior. I cannot recommend this device to anyone. Unless you were buying it for your 8year old."
JoG,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's perfect. It weighs nothing. I love the extra storage. The battery is not as long as advertised but it is still very good. The off button can be easily pressed by mistake. The pages can turn over too easily. Minor problems. It's still the BEST.
Carmen A. Rivera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th kindle. The others were either lost or broken. This 4th one is very similar to my 3rd kindle. Both are have paperwhite lighting, small and lightweight, and easy to navigate. This one wakes up quickly and has some additional features the 3rd did not.

I bought a cover that puts the kindle to sleep (just like an iPad) when closed, and that is really a great addition. I haven't tested the waterproof feature, but it's good to know it's there."
Sue Lyons,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son bought this for me for Christmas so I could read in he hot tub and have something small and portable to take books when I travel. I am really enjoying it! I haven’t taken the time to figure out all of the features yet, but I love that it fits easily in my purse so I have my books whenever I have a minute to read. The battery life is great! I have only had to charge it one time since I started using it (3weeks)! I have a cruise with lots of sea days and an 11 plus hour flight coming up and this will be so much better than trying to carry around a bunch of books."
Patrick Quaglietta,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's great, but no talking dictionary, that's wh it's not a 5 star. I can read for hours without my eyes bothering me, the no blue light, lighting is perfect.
Able to change my reading position (and I read in some weird positions) without missing a word.
Light easy to carry. Go for the bigger memory, its more than just the amount of books it holds, but the speed of use."
Word Maven,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This reminds me of the original reader but is thinner, lighter, and more sophisticated...with a lot more storage. It’s a great reader and is especially convenient for reading on trips ( take “many” books yet only one item). I really like it!"
Wesley G. Skogan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The opening screen has become much more obtrusive with Kindle 10. Now you have to swipe a small button in a crowded corner of the screen with your tiniest finger in order to avoid a page full of ads waiting to be touched, in order to get to your own library of books. My wife refuses to use it, and has taken over my earlier Paperwhite, which opens directly to a list of books in my library or to the most recent page I was reading. Irritatingly, Amazon."
Adam,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't say enough how much I love this new Kindle Paperwhite e-reader :) It's easy to setup, has good battery life even with the backlighting and wi-fi, and is the perfect size and weight. This product has reinvigorated my long dormant love for reading! so happy i decided to scoop this up on a $99 sale!"
Stoic01,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned a Kindle some years ago, and over time I stopped using it. My son got one of these newer versions and encouraged me to try it. I'm hooked. The display is excellent; highlighting a text and transferring the notes to another program is simple; and it's small enough to slip into a pants pocket. We recently went on a trip abroad, and instead of stuffing my backpack with a bunch of books, I brought the Kindle and it performed flawlessly.

One little thing: I sometimes lose track of where I put things, so I added a tracking device to the back of the Kindle.

I recommend this to all bibliophiles. It doesn't replace paper books, but it offers more options."
clb,5.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW!!! With the Prime Day deal and a $25 trade-in, I got a great price on the new waterproof Kindle. The new Kindle is a little lighter and smaller with a great backlight, but I love the touch screen feature. Just touch the right side of the screen to go to the next page. No more flipping the pages. The waterproof feature may be a selling point to others but wasn't a big deal to me. I was a little disappointed that my old Kindle case didn't fit but problem solved with a little double-sided tape. Love my kindle."
Laura S Reading,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had mine less than a month but what I can tell you so far is that it is much more sensitive (not a good thing) to touch. Hold it wrong and pages turn. It also seems slower to load books than previous paperwhites and I do NOT find it holds a charge as long. I wish that it was blue on both front and back but that doesn't affect functuality.
I do reccomend you wait and buy it on a sale day."
Sawdust,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from a standard Kindle that I've had for 5 years that has 3G of memory and no light. I paid the extra and got 32G of memory with the new Paperwhite; I'll never run out of storage. The text is sharp and the adjustable light is nice for reading in poorly lighted environments. Although, I usually have it turned off, or on low, too conserve battery. The battery technology has also improved and this one goes much longer between recharges. I also got the standard Kindle leather case, and those have also improved as well.

All good, I would buy it again and do recommend it. The convenience of having so many books available in such a small unit is awesome, especially when traveling."
2xist,5.0 out of 5 stars,I enjoy this E-reader very much. It is truly an superior product. I am however puzzled at the exorbitant pricing of the 32gb model considering the low cost of memory ‘Today’. 32gb should be standard.
Karin Walters,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Paper White and the only reason I got a new one was because the one I bought in 2013 I accidentally put on the top of my car and ran over it. Turns out, the screens are not resistant to the weight of a two ton car. However--the fact that I've had minimal issues with a 6 year old electronic device gives me confidence to buy another one.

It was sort of annoying because I recently bought a new case so the size of the Kindle has changed. Is the new design necessarily drastically different? Not necessarily in terms of the reading/light (but this is my untrained eyes?). Instead of having a ""sunken"" screen it's more of a level screen (which I think helps with the ""Waterproofing""--I haven't tested this bc that seems like an unnecessary risk). It is a little bit smaller than my previous version as well, but not in a way that detracts from the experience.

I love bringing around my Kindle everywhere and so far so good."
D. Strobl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After owning a second generation Kindle for almost 20 years, it finally gave out and will no longer download books. I also own a Kindle Fire but reading it in sunlight is very difficult. So, I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite and love it! It is great for reading in sunlight and the backlight makes it great to read in low light too. The perfect Kindle for travel - it fits right in my small purse. The format is similar to the Fire, just in black and white. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase!"
Sunshine,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first experience with reading other than a regular book. I love it and now I'm hooked. I ordered a leather cover personalized for my new companion and its perfect. I've already read two books and will be purchasing more in the near future. Now that I'm retired I actually have time to read again, YEAH!"
Rapid1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I keep my 'reading material' in the bathroom. I used a 7"" tablet until it died after only 4 years. This Kindle Paperwhite is a handier size, brighter screen and easier to read. So far the battery life is much better than the tablet was. I would heartily recommend this unit for anyone who likes to read. Moving my Kindle library was effortless. As soon as I logged into my Kindle account, everything was just there. Great buy for me."
Art Palmer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Have not been able to use Audible with my Beats headset although it's connected using bluetooth.
Deniseebean,5.0 out of 5 stars,I traded in my really old Kindle 2 for this new Paperwhite version and I couldn't be happier. I can read it anywhere and it is so lightweight that I can throw it in my purse and it doesn't add much weight or bulk. The screen makes it very easy on my eyes and I love the wifi .....my old Kindle didn't have that so this is awesome. No regrets here!
anonymous,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: i haven't had the opportunity to try out the waterproof feature yet, but I'm excited to be able to use this by the pool or bath without worrying about splashes. The battery really is amazing and the size makes it as comfortable as a small book. I've used mini tablets to read on for years, and it really is nice to be able to focus on a book without having the distractions and temptations of other apps (e.g. - emails, pop ups) and do actually recommend having a device just for this if you can swing it.
Cons: There is a lag turning pages, opening books, going to the home screen. I wouldn't expect this by this point in a Kindle given that it's not running other applications in the background."
B. Fisher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been eyeing the Kindle paperwhite for over a year, and received one as a Christmas gift. Reading an hour, or so, each night, it took a week for the battery to drop to 75%.

I love that you can read the screen in a bright room or in full sunlight, without any glare, and if you need to read in the dark, the backlight only has to go to ~30-35% to make reading easy.

I've got ~40 books on mine, so far, and it only uses a small fraction of the storage space.

It's about the same size as a paperback book page, which is a bit smaller than the old Kindles, but it does just fine."
Richard P Boudreau,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The kindle Paperwhite failed after two months of use. This was a gifted item, but when that person tried to return it at Whole Foods for repair (and after waiting in line for hours), they were told by the clerk that the original receipt and a copy of the insurance was insufficient to process the repair. The clerk was having difficulty because it was purchased as a gift on a different Amazon account. The clerk requested a bar code off of the original purchase, but good luck finding that. One of the things we sacrifice in obtaining products online is ""uncomplicated service."" Dealing with Amazon through their proxy, Whole Foods, is like dealing with the department of Motor Vehicles, probably worse."
Tiffany G.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This has been a great upgrade from my generation 5 kindle. The battery last a while when I’m airplane mode and using the light doesn’t completely drain the battery. There is more of a glare on this one than my old one, but for all the extras it’s a small inconvenience. I do like that it’s water resistant, makes me feel more comfortable taking this with me to the pool or relaxing in the tub. I definitely recommend this!"
John Clark,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kindle Paperwhite is a pleasure to read in any kind of environment. It's too soon to say if the battery life is all that much better. I only turned in my old Kindle because of extreme age making the battery lose charge fast.
Oleg,1.0 out of 5 stars,"UI is actually terrible: it is impossible to change the size of home page font, tree folder structure is not supported at all, documents are not grouped by the author, etc. It looks like it is designed to read only one book. Swipes sometimes are interpreted like clicks, some rendering bugs are observed. Poor battery comparing to old keyboard version. There is no visual difference in the screen quality with old keyboard version if using comfortable size fonts, cold backlight. ""Paperwhite""? It is just a lie. Buggy documents uploading via e-mail. Micro-USB. Poor customer technical support. The only advantage is the price with discount especially if you also have free additional coupons. Never buy it for full price.
P. S. It does not respond on clicks properly (missing clicks or wrong coordinates) while charging battery (by Amazon's charger for old keyboard Kindle)"
Jannynet,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Paperwhite and I'm liking it very much. I'm a reader so the increased capacity makes it easy to make my choices from more books. The screen is comfortable and I like the lighter weight, though it's not a lot of decrease. I'm hooked and due to arthritis that makes holding books painful, I'll never go back to print media if possible. Download is fast. The only thing I, personally, am not crazy about is the wake up pause. It's not enough for me to reduce my rating. Keep on Kindle-ing!!!!"
Ron Stroud,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed with the product. Not user friendly. Still have not figured out the downloading.
Roger Sorenson,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Unlike older editions, The Kindle Paperwhite (10th Gen) is NOT compatible with ""Active Content"" (e.g., Scrabble for Kindle). If you want such content, or have such content on an older Kindle, and expect it to transfer, it WILL NOT. I didn't find this drawback anywhere in the Paperwhite description on Amazon, and my failed attempts to transfer the content to the Paperwhite never explained this. I had to deal with customer support.
Also, the USB cable provided with the device would not insert, no matter how hard I tried. Other cables I already owned are working. On contacting customer support, I was provided a link to obtain a new cable, free of charge, shown as credit when submitting the order."
Chris M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, I admit it...for a long time I resisted because I like the feel of a book in my hand. But too many planes and overstuffed carry-on bags changed my mind, and my wonderful girlfriend bought me this for Christmas. I love how light and easy to carry it is (back pocket of my jeans? No problem!) and it solves another dilemma - whether to turn on the overhead light on a late-night flight when I'm the only one awake! Initially I thought the battery had an issue, but now it seems fine and is only down to 60% after a week of use. Huge fan!"
Lyndia Fox,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally broke down and purchase the Paperwhite and am glad I did. I spend a great deal of time outside when the weather finally gets warm and was getting discourage because I could not read my Kindle Fire outside. Sooooo, I purchased the Paperwhite on Prime Day. One of the best purchases ever! Now I am never without reading material. The two Kindles link so I can go from one to the other and am always at the last place I read.
Thank you Amazon!!"
Triple Horseshoe Farm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love how light it is. It weighs less than my cell phone. Fits nice in the outside pocket of my purse. It’s easy to read during the day. It is also easy to read at night with the lights off. I love that I can read in bed without disturbing my husband.
The battery life is great. I use my Kindle everyday I have never run out of battery life. I plug in each night. I would not be surprised if the battery life could go a couple of days.
My grandson who is eleven and loves to read, has one too. It handles him dropping it and boy roughness.
I had a Kindle years ago and didn’t like not having a book. Where you turn the pages and hold the book. I got this as a gift from the grandkids so I had to use it while they were here. After the first day I was hooked on this. I truly would never be without it again. When reading a book series it is so easy to get the next book.
I love my Kindle and would highly recommend it. If you owned a Kindle in the past and didn’t care for it. Give this one a try."
LFP,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So the Kindle is still the archetype and best ereader out there period. But they claim this is the 10th Generation (eh not really) paperwhite and the touch response is still somewhere back in 2005. You have to think they could have made it a little snappier by now but hey.

Making it waterproof is a great touch though and these things last a looooooooong time. Been kindling for 10 years."
Baby Bumble Bee,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I continue to love the paper white platform and the ability to read while my husband is sleeping. I was looking forward to the new version holding a longer charge which has not happened. It only lasts about as long as the previous version. I do love how rapidly it recharges ! Less than an hour. The new flat reading surface is interesting. Less to grab onto and hold. There does seem to be more reading area.
I wish I was able to delete books off my device and back to the cloud however when I try to “ delete from device” items stay on the device.
Overall I would buy it again because of the fast recharge."
Claude,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I ride a motorcycle and i don't like needing a case to keep my Kindle waterproof. I bought this one so that I wouldn't have to have a case on my kindle, but the on/off on the bottom is sensitive and turns itself off constantly. If I remember correctly, one of my previous generation Kindles could be upside down and then the bottom wouldn't be constantly turning off while reading. I do not recommend. I might as well have kept my old kindle with a case since I'm going to have to get a case anyway."
Allie,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my Kindle eReader 2 days ago and just discovered that the USB Charger cord does not fit into the Port on the device. It is a very tight fit and only goes in about 3/4 of the way. I called Amazon to report the issue and was told that the wrong charger cord is being sent with the new Kindle Paperwhite. Just want to inform you guys as to check to make sure your charger is working properly as soon as you receive the eReader. Be sure that the charger icon on the device is registering the charge in the upper right hand corner with a lightening bolt inside. If not, give Amazon/Kindle a call and they will kindly replace the charger for you. Nonetheless, I am not going to give a rating on the eReader just yet but I will in a week or so."
Elaine,2.0 out of 5 stars,"To be fair, I was used to using a Fire tablet. I bought while I was in a bit of a rush and didn't realize I was not purchasing another fire tablet. It is shorter than a standard paperback book making it feel small and awkward in my hands. The touch screen works fine when turning pages, but navigating after waking it up is frustrating for me. Again, I may be trying to use it like a fire tablet, but I would not recommend a purchase. For the money... get the tablet."
Go Cuse,3.0 out of 5 stars,There is a built in defect I believe that customers need to be aware of. My Kindle could not synch with Blue Tooth and my Panasonic noise canceling headphones to access Audible as advertised. The Amazon tech was baffled. From other reviews I have read this seems to be an inherent problem. Amazon needs to fix the problem or have a big buyer beware notice added . Very disappointed
Jholski,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I Downloaded several books already but was disappointed that battery life is so short. I turn on airplane mode and used it for a few hours a day but the battery last for around 3 days. Last night, I slept with 33% battery on it and woke up with it having a dead battery. I have a cover that works putting it to sleep mode so I am sure the screen was off the entire night. This really fails to meet my expectation. Plus images for the books takes time to load. I like seeing the covers of the books but sometimes it doesn't show! Also, response was slow. Turning pages gets confusing sometimes even if I know I touched the right area. Sometimes it get stuck. would have wanted that the features available in the kindle in my iphone is the same here like having the reader insight. Some books is not indexed so I cannot run search functions in all books. In iphone it does this faster. I almost returned this but chose to keep it so i can have like having a dedicated device for reading but really quite disappointed."
Alan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Is anyone else getting books recommended with offenisve pictures on the cover and if you use Amazon Music getting recommendations with explicit curse word in the title. I tried talking to Amazon but the chat people told me there was nothing they could do and gave me an email address that got kicked back because they do not accept direct emails. I find it amazing that you cannot make a complaint to Amazon. I did find it interesting that when I left the kindle a one star review they called my house to see why I left the review but yet, they don't accept complaints. I guess the only way to complain to Amazon is to leave it on a review. If you are experiencing any of the same issue I suggest you make your displeasure known in your reviews.
Locks up often. Typical Amazon junk."
Zerz360,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really like this updated Kindle! The backlight is great, and also being able to read in the dark, while still having ""e-ink"" is so great! I didn't like to always have to have a light on to read my kindle, nor do I like to use my phone before bed, so this is perfect! I can also read in the bath or by the pool without having to worry about my Kindle. Such a great product that will last me a long, long time!"
Maria,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my new Kindle Paperwhite! I'd had my other one for years so it was beginning to ""lock up"" at the most inopportune times, as well as turn several pages at once, or NOT at all!!! I would have to completely shut it down and restart it to get it work for a few more days...you can imagine.

I've not tested out its waterproof abilities, and hope never to have to do so! But it
is nice to know it is there if I were to drop it in the bath!

Highly recommended and love the new font thats been added, easy to read and just bold enough"
Bob,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a very early generation Kindle that I had fallen out of the habit of using. When I saw the promo to swap and save on the latest generation - I jumped on it, and am VERY HAPPY I did. The new Waterproof Kindle Paperwhite is great! It is small enough that I routinely commute on BART with it, great screen (no headaches from reading), and the fact that it's waterproof (whatever that means in reality, I'm not interested in testing, but at least I can rest a little easier) make this an AWESOME purchase!"
Phil,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just purchased this a week ago to replace my old paperwhite that I left on a plane. I fully charged it upon receipt and I just ran out of battery 5 days later. I am a heavy reader but my old model lasted 2 weeks between charges. I love kindles but this is a disappointing ""Upgrade""."
Hector,5.0 out of 5 stars,The paperwhite is the perfect eReader for traveling and late night reading! I’ve purchased others tablets for the purpose of reading and they’ve ended up in a drawer. There’s no glare on the paperwhite so you can read outdoor as well. The light is perfect for reading in the dark - so as not to disturb your partner. I’m glad I got this and have already filled it with plenty of books!
Ceryl Southard,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the lightness of it and the larger storage space. I think what you say about the storage space is deceptive. You say as part of the description of the new Kindle Paperwhite that it has 32 GB of space. When I open up the Kindle drive on my computer it says I only effectively have 27 GB. That's a bit disappointing. I liked the raised border around the older Kindles. I think it protects the screen from damage when I drop my Kindle. I have dropped it on hard surface floors before by accident and the screen was undamaged and the Kindle continued to work fine. It is a good product.
D.M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that this paperwhite has lots more storage and is as easy to read in bright light as promised. The touch screen is great too but quite ""laggy"" and not as responsive as I'd like. Scrolling is not smooth at all when you're trying to read reviews and shop for new titles so I try to buy from my laptop so I don't have to scroll on the paperwhite. Fortunately, there is no scrolling necessary to read."
Ltkk,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The lighting is much better on the Kindle Paperwhite than it is on my tablet. It's easier on the eyes. I love that you can change the font and the size of the font. Battery drains quickly though when using Bluetooth earplugs. Disappointed that there isn't a plug for earphones. The size is convenient and comfortable. Overall, I like the Kindle Paperwhite for reading above everything else I've used."
pl,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There should be a way to turn the light on and off as needed in addition to the adjustment for brightness. Battery life is less than a regular Kindle without light, but it's still good and much better than a cell phone. Having the light is really nice. Now I don't need my Kindle light that attached to my old Kindle Touch. Some things are harder to do than on the Kindle Touch. It's a little thinner, smaller, lighter than the Touch. I'm glad I traded up."
noel,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This was purchased for my wife who has poor vision. While I had some difficulty with in putting our local Wifi, due to ?
Once the Wifi was accepted, it seems to work as well as the older Kindle touch. Besides easier reading in dim light, the page response time is excellent and so far no lost place has happened. She will write another review after reading a couple more books.."
Joy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a little worried about the quality after reading the reviews about the pinholes, glares and how it’s the worst paperwhite ever. But very pleased with it so far! No pinhole, glare or battery issues that I’ve noticed. The only thing is that the back smudges really easily, but other than unsightly fingerprints and a rather weirdly placed on/off button (it’s at the bottom) everything works fine. Oh and shipping took forever (~2 weeks, think there was some delay) P.S got it at $99, perhaps should’ve waited for Prime Day to make it even more worth it."
Judy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Kindle as I had a large number of Amazon ebooks downloaded to a reader that was not a paperwhite. That was hard on my eyes. I have a Nook Paperwhite that I like very much but had enough Amazon ebooks to warrant the additional reader. This Kindle is not user friendly to me. The frame size on the sides measures only 1/2"" wide. The screen is extremely sensitive. That combination results in inadvertent page turning. Also, the power button is on the bottom of the frame and you must be careful not to push the button and, inadvertently, turn the unit off. There is no setting (that I could find) to change the amount of time before the automatic shutdown. The Nook paperwhite does have that flexibility. I will keep this Kindle in spite of my discomfort in the usability. The screen is bright. The font choices are fine."
P M,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sensitivity of the screen when you need to return to home screen. The format and layout of the library. I wish I could see a bigger portion of the library books before I page over. It takes some getting used to. When you have used an ipad for reading, then of course kindle white doesn’t compare. However I purchased this because my eyes were hurting too much reading solely reading off the ipad."
Anima72,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is our fourth or fifth kindle. I bought a new one for my daughter as hers was used up. However, the first one I got had to be exchanged as it had to be recharged daily. The new one we got has strange issues with battery life as well. It will run fine for a couple of days and all of a sudden the battery will deplete completely out of nowhere. Even from 80 pct to zero i one afternoon. We now recharge every couple of days. I am hoping it will go away or there is some software issue. It is definitely not as good as any of the kindle paperwhites I had so far..."
april messer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I want to love this like my other 3 kindles but... The battery doesn't last, you can't set the clock on a 12 HR setting its military time& you can't set the time of how long it stays on. I fall asleep& it stays on forever&runs down the battery,my other kindled had a setting I set to turn off in 10 mins of idleness. Hope they fix the battery issues."
Lovestoread728,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The ad says it holds a charge for weeks rather than hours. Not true. It holds a charge for 3 or 4 days. That's better than the previous version but doesn't live up to hype. This is my third Kindle, and I generally like every one I've had. This newest version is pretty much the same as the others."
Julia R. A. Lopresti,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Kindle. My first being the first generation Kindle Fire. This one is great. Way more lightweight than my first Kindle which makes it great for traveling. My only complaint is that there’s no way to completely remove books off the device. It will always display ALL your books that you’ve ever purchased via Kindle (and are stored in the cloud). Although there’s a way for you to toggle between “ALL” books and the ones “DOWNLOADED” to that Kindle, I don’t like that I can see every single book that I have when I click to “ALL”. For example, I purchased a few children’s books several years ago because my first Kindle Fire was great for displaying children’s picture books in color. Now that my child no longer reads picture books I really don’t have any need for those books to be “taking up space” on my new kindle. I’d rather just be able to remove it from the device completely and not even have to see it listed on my new kindle."
Felipe Castillo Appas,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was reluctant to buy a kindle or any other ebook reader because I have tried the app and the computer for books reading and both have been very dissapointing (red eye, short ammount of pages readen before getting tired, and other bad things)
I decided to give a try to the las kindle paperwhite because it said that it can resist water.
Since I received it, not only have been more into reading but I have been less tired and my eyes have be3n much confortable during and after reading.
Now I think this kindle is the best electronic way to read a lot without having eyes' discomfort.
Of course I still will be a fan of paper books, but kindle is now a very good alternative to consider, specially when I am on a plane o in an car for a trip."
2Boy Mom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After 5.5 yrs, my first Kindle finally died. It was a sad day indeed. So far, I am enjoying this new one. Does seem a little slower to wake up when I open my case, but otherwise it's GREAT! I read 2-3 books per week, so it is well loved and well used!"
J. Helms,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I each have a 2015 Paperwhite, and we recently decided it was probably time to update them to the newer releases—they've been feeling a little sluggish to use lately.

But after using them for 2 days, we returned them because the screen is WAY TOO BRIGHT. 90% of the time we use our Kindle its in bed in a completely dark room. On the old Kindles we kept our brightness around 5 or 6, and it was just right… a soft light that's legible but helps ease you to sleep.

The screen on the new model—even at a brightness of 1—is still much brighter than brightness 5 or 6 on the older model.

It's really unfortunate. Overall we really liked the newer model. Feels more sleek, lighter, screen looks sharper, and the performance is better (though perhaps not as fast as I hoped)."
James J. Gerbino,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace a Kindle Paperwhite of the previous generation. After a few years the old one still works perfectly. A full battery charge lasts weeks. The new one... a 100% charge drains to 5% overnight. This is with wifi and Bluetooth turned off. I like the new one fine, but getting one that is defective is enough to dock 3 stars from my rating. If the replacement works properly I will amend my review. Otherwise, I wish I had stayed with the old one."
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"don't waste your money on this piece of krap go for a kennel fire first of all it does not come with any instructions the first I tried to use I was reading a story bomb it switched me to another story on its own went to the community forum with a question the remark I got
back was that question does not appear in the forum sorry we cannot help you goodbye

if anyone wants any more Horror stories contact me on facebook"
Kani,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thought I would find ir difficult to use cause I love physical books. But a few days in and I'm already a believer. Haha. Easy, easy easy. Love it. Still like my physical books but like that I can carry many books at once on my kindle. Books get heavy especially when moving around."
Heidi Sprague,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally cracked and bought one. I didn't want to but I am so glad that I did. I have loved this little guy so much!! I have been able to read more! It's so easy to get books and I can even connect it with my library app through my phone to get books. I was a little hesitant because I love myself a good book with good binding. But I can always go get one if I need one and this Kindle again makes it so easy to read! If you are even thinking about it let me just tell you, BUY IT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!"
A. Rebecca Owens,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th Kindle (over the years). My last kindle opened immediately with ""swipe to open."" This one says ""waking up"" then ""swipe to open."" Not a deal breaker but confusing since newer electronics tend to be faster, not slower. This is also tiny bit smaller than the one I'm replacing. That means I had to buy a folio specifically for this one and could not use the perfectly good cover I had."
Metta La Madrid,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My kindle locked up and died only 8 months after I bought it. This is my second Kindle and my first one lasted many, many years with almost daily use. I also don't like the fact that it doesn't have a hard plastic rim around the screen like my old one did...I keep accidentally touching the screen and going back or forward a page. Frustrating. Also frustrating is the location of the on/off button on the bottom. It is so easy to accidentally turn the power off...why don't they put it on the top?"
Nana,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not recommended. It reads pretty well but be aware that you need a special, expensive, USB plug to charge. Also, chances are you cannot download ebooks from your library unless they use Overdrive/Libby. Mine, and many libraries use CloudLibrary and/or Hoopla. The Paperwhite is not compatible with these two services. Not sure why because the Kindle Fire reader is compatible. Why would Amazon eliminate access to these services on the new ereader?? When I asked they could not give me an answer. I suspect, they just want to limit your choices so you have to buy ebooks from Amazon at a cost instead of using your free public library. A shame!! Do not recommend buying this device, it is too limited and is a lot more money!"
Matt,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an 8th gen paperwhite that I loved. I had been cheating fate by using it near water and figured sooner or later I would get bit, so I upgraded to the new waterproof paperwhite. Overall I have no real complaints, other I the screen on my 8th gen felt a bit differnt...almost more ""paper like"" if that makes sense. I liked it better but I can get used to the new design. The other issue, is that I can see more glare on this new screen than the 8th gen. not enough to be unusable but still more than I'm used too."
FoCOGuy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I have used Kindle products since 2009, 2nd generation and Keyboard models. She originally purchased a Paperwhite in 2016 but stopped using it because it was impossible to keep the typeface stable and control page turning, returning to a 2010 Kindle Keyboard. We purchased another one, the latest model, because she wanted the lighted screen, and it works quite well and is easy to control, much more comfortable than the original. At the same time, we reactivated the original Paperwhite from 2016 and found it now works acceptably. I don't know whether it was an OS upgrade or what, but these devices both keep their promises of ease of reading in low light and longer battery life."
legnanoc,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love everything about the kindle. All except for the battery life. I am retired, so I read most of the time. Fully charged the battery lasted about 3 days. Not bad, but far from the weeks I have heard. Much better than my phone, yes. But I wished for more."
Sue Nonweiler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the size and the battery life. I cannot decide if the touch screen is too sensitive or not sensitive enough. When I try to highlight, it over- or under- highlights depending on how it interpreted the touch. I cannot seem to get a consistent response."
William E. Corwin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As it is my third Kindle, the improvements continue to evolve. This version is excellent. Handling, however, is a little less comfortable, for me. Specifically: opening the blue cover; then grasping the ""open"" Kindle with the left hand while reading, the grip isn't as secure as my second Kindle, which has a leather cover. Perhaps you have ""older"" readers.....who encounter the inevitable: arthritis. Nonetheless, it would require considerable effort to remove ""K"" from home!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from a basic Kindle (no light) and I love the Paperwhite. I no longer have to clip a little gooseneck lamp to the top of the reader in order to see the screen at night. The touchscreen can be a little iffy; I'm currently reading something with a lot of footnotes and I can't always get to them because the touchscreen just doesn't seem to be calibrated quite right. I usually wind up getting the definition for a word somewhere around the footnote rather than the footnote itself. Still, I have no real complaints and it's definitely an upgrade from the basic Kindle models."
Dee F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Paperwhite 10 is amazing! It's so lightweight and that makes it easier hold AND it will switch over to Audible if I need to continue my books. It holds my place when switching from sound to reading which is beyond convenient. It checks all the boxes and I received my order super fast. I love that I can read in the dark and when I'm tired, I just connect it to my Bluetooth speaker and let the sound of the stories ease me into sleep. I can't believe how much I love this reader!"
B Boldi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first e-reader of any kind. I was resistant to the idea of not holding and feeling an actual book, but I like it more than I ever thought I would. I can read in bed in the dark even when the kids are in our room sleeping. Great, bright Screen and I love being able to buy a book immediately and review it all from my little Paperwhite. It's much smaller than I expected, but I love it."
Gary Mccord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I already have a Kindle Fire that stays on my Nordic Track, but it is bulky to travel with and a little bright also. The paper white is small and light, barely larger than a phone and had a great display and reminds me of my first kindle. You can slip it into a coat pocket easily and ready anywhere. I also added the Kindle app to my phone incase I forget or don't have room for the paper white."
Beth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m really enjoying my new Kindle. I couldn’t be happier with the battery life. One charge lasted nearly 2 months! The built in light is perfect for reading at night. I wish the touch screen was a little better. It feels a little slow and clunky. Also, I wish there was a color options for images. I know I can use my phone for iPad for books with images, but I hate to keep swapping out. However, for just straight up reading I am more than happy."
Stephen J. Taylor,1.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I loved it but now I don’t. The battery won’t stay charged. I don’t use it everyday but everytime I go to use it I fond the battery has drained to zero. Amazon advertises that the battery last for a long time. Not true. I traded in my old one and wish I had not. While the extra storage is nice and the audible feature are great, unless the battery can stay charged the product is worthless because you can’t take it anyplace unless you can charge it all the time. Pretty sure it will be headed back."
D Murphy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fifth Kindle and I am thrilled with it. I traded in three and the paperwhite has made my life better in that I can read till all hours while not disturbing my partner at all. I read a LOT so this is a blessing. This Kindle is thin, lightweight, and has great screen quality."
Tracy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Went from the 1st generation Kindle Touch (w/cellular) to the new Kindle paperwhite (wifi only). Device itself is great and love the new features and it is much easier to shop. BUT, it says the battery life is ""weeks""? I've yet to get a full week out of a charge - And yes, I keep the wifi turned off, I don't use the screen on the brightest setting and I average reading an hour/day. This aspect is highly disappointing to me as my old kindle went 3+ weeks on a charge. If the battery life was comparable, I would give this 5 stars!"
Peggy L,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it because my other Kindle's battery would not stay charged. I am not interested in Good Reads or whatever it's called but it seems that just comes with this new one, and the ads to buy this book or that book are not appreciated. I was very happy with my old one but circumstances changed and I needed to by another one.This one is ok I guess, but to me, not as user friendly as my old one."
Dave,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned 3 kindles over the last 5-6 years. While their functionality as an e-reader is very good, their reliability is very poor. The first one lasted a couple of years and, at one point, when I went to turn it on, all I got on the screen was a simple battery shape. Despite trying to re-start multiple times, it would not work. After much struggle and wait, I finally got a hold of a kindle ""tech"" as Amazon. He said try holding the on-off button down for 30 seconds to see if it would start up. No luck--the battery symbol kept coming back. He said there was nothing else he could do as my unit was out of warranty. So I bought a second kindle. This one also worked fine for a couple of years but then the on-off button became very mushy. Toward the end it was a struggle to turn on. I had to use a fine screw driver to push on the button but it could still take up to 5 minutes to find the ""sweet spot"" to turn on. This time I did not call service just to hear the kindle was out of warranty. I bought my 3rd kindle, which is working fine. Just wondering what is gonna cause it to fail after it is out of warranty...…."
Robert Ferguson Sr.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my new (and only) Kindle, Enjoy the fact that is so light, can be held upright in bed with two fingers, and the reading light is fantastic. I don't even see the glow of the LEDs in the bottom as warned about in reviews. They are a non-issue.
My only complaint, and probably not fair since I tend to go right over instructions, but twice in three books I somehow lost my place, since I was way off on my page I was reading, and had to search page by page until I got back. No doubt, my fault, but I will learn."
J. E. Mynchenberg,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is easier to hold in my hand and fit in my purse, so I can carry it anywhere and use it anytime. The touchscreen is sometimes a bit too sensitive and occasionally turns pages before I'm ready, but otherwise the settings are easy to adjust to the location I'min when I'm reading a book. The print and lighting are easy on my eyes, so I can read for short or long periods comfortably."
suba,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the simple approach but find working around kindle unltd a bit confusing;
the kindle device itself turns a page by tapping the middle of the side; on right it goes ahead on left it goes back a one page instruction to assist in the operation might make it easier; the device isn't at fault so much as the software; but it does need directions included to learn how to navigate around; its not like a regular kindle;"
7onefour,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands down, the Kindle Whitepaper is an amazing e-reader. However, I decided to also purchase the Kindle Oasis. They are both amazing products but I must say that I enjoy having more visual real estate with the 7” screen of the Oasis vs the 6” screen of the whitepaper. My girlfriend wanted one after she saw my whitepaper so, she has it now and loves it. Overall, you can’t go wrong with Kindle."
Joseph R Enlow,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible device, it constantly jumps pages and pages ahead and one spends way to much time backing up to find the actual last page read. Threw mine against the wall and will never use it again. What a waste of money! Shame on you Amazon for selling such a horrible inferior device."
Cindy L,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this new paperwhite. It is a replacement for my 6th edition that decided it wanted to remain on the cruise ship. Now that I decided to buy the 10th edition I am so glad I did. I can now read in the bathtub without fear it will fall in. As noted, it is much slimmer. The back skin is not slick so it won’t slide out of your hand. I bought a cover only so I can read in bed and have it propped up. MOST important thing!! Don’t automatically think your kindle Bluetooth feature isn’t working. I thought something was wrong when it wasn’t. My Bluetooth headset was too old to pair. I bought a new $20.00 headset and it works perfectly."
R. Layne,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the original Kindle when released and later upgraded to the Kindle DX. After the DX I used my iOS devices to read. But backlit displays have drawbacks even given today’s resolutions. I love to read outdoors. OLED, LCD, etc suffer in bright light. I finally missed the E-Ink display so much that I purchased Paper-White. It is a great design and exactly the right size and weight for what I wanted. A very good product."
J. Minor,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like everything about this new kindle! My main reason for upgrading was the ability to read at night without using a clunky book light. I find myself reading more even during the day because the interface is so improved over the first generation reader I was still using.
janet,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it! This Kindle is my 5th. I had an accident with one and the others I got as gifts or personal upgrades. I once bought a Nook and a Sony e-reader and they were fine. Nothing compared to Kindle. It so easy to use and so easy if you need help. You get a starter booklet , it comes on your Kindle. And customer support is excellent. The built in dictionary is great."
Chelle68,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this as a gift so that i would have something a bit more portable to read on than my IPad Pro. I noticed immediately that it was not nearly as responsive as i was accustomed to and not very easy to search and find the books i have on my cloud. But the main reason for the low star rating is the battery. It came with 41% battery. The day after I received it, i plugged the included charger in to top up the charge. When i checked it an hour later the charge was down to 20%. An hour after that and the device was dead. I changed the usb plug i was using twice, still nothing. Tech support could not find the cause either so i am returning it for a refund. Very disappointing first try with a stand alone kindle device."
WestieLover,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This kindle is advertised as having battery life that “lasts weeks, not hours,” but the opposite is true. I started with it fully charged this morning, and I’ve read for about 4 hours today. My battery is now down to 65%. I’m not listening to audiobooks, I am simply reading a book that was previously downloaded. I really like everything else about this kindle, but the limited battery life is very frustrating, especially since one reason I chose this one was because of the supposed extended battery life."
Z. tasman,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Generally like the overall kindle feeling, esp under bright lights, unlike tablet. Couple feedback for improvement:
1) the off button, why is it at the bottom where people tend to hold the book. In my experience, it turns off the book too many times to warrant moving that button else where (perhaps at top, where people don't usually hold a book?)

2) the general lack of responsiveness... it tends to lag... if Kindle engineering team can improve the experience to be more like surfing on a tablet (responsiveness, zero lag, screen responds to touch more seamlessly)"
Sherrell Wilson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle version is SO amazing because I can finally take a book INTO the pool with me to read to my heart's content. My husband has had previous Kindles and I never felt like I needed one since I read my Kindle library on my iPad. As we all know, the iPad has its disadvantages -- like no reading in the pool or even outside on a sunny day for that matter. So when I saw the waterproof Kindle, I immediately bought one. Being able to read on my pool float is a GAME-CHANGER!"
Landorl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing! I charged it when I got it, and that has been about 3 weeks and it is down to about 50% now. I have read on it a lot. I turn the light off during the day, and it uses very little power then.

The light works well but isn't great. It is much easier to use in natural light. When using the light it feels like you are reading off of a phone screen or something similar. That is my only real knock.

The touch screen works well, though I have had to tap a second time a few times because I touched it too lightly.."
Da S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought kindle a month prior to this one but replaced it with paperwhite because paperwhite was on sale for father's day. I don't see too much of a difference between the two other than speed of responsiveness. When I tried to highlight or look up definitions of words on kindle, the time it took for the dictionary to pop up was long but it was not slow enough that it frustrated me. Paperwhite, on the other hand, responds way more slowly when I try to perform the same task. It takes about two full seconds after I press on the words for the dictionary to pop up. Considering that this paperwhite is supposed to be ""better"" than kindle, it's quite disappointing. I find myself using this function way less frequently due to this issue. I won't bother returning this because I already had done it before, but I wouldn't recommend this over kindle to anybody. Other than the issue with slow responsiveness, I don't have much comment, positive or negative, because I am new to kindle products."
ENDEL LOPEZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice product. I had a previous generation with no light and I barely used it. I haven’t put this one down. It’s faster, more responsive, and worth the trade off that amazon offered me. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. It is a good way to take your books with you and read anywhere anytime. I still love my traditional books however, this serves as a nice bridge between both mediums."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really overdo for an upgrade to my kindle as I was still using an early generation paperwhite. I delayed purchasing a new one because old one still worked well even if the battery was failing. And because, I am often underwhelmed by how little development is put into products after the initial creation. But this new kindle is an exception to that norm. Serious product development has gone into this kindle. Better battery life, better clarity of text, more storage space, improved touch responsiveness, plus a backlight that doesn’t blind or cause glare, AND now it’s waterproof! Also, with the trade in discount for my old one, I am pretty sure I paid less than I did for my old one!"
Chu Yong DeWeese,5.0 out of 5 stars,"All the programs the Kindle offers are perfect for me. I enjoy reading and am planning to read more. English is 2nd language for me, if I knew what Kindle can help me to enrich my English I would have bought this long ago!
The instant dictionary and the word wise programs are greatest help, the kindle is perfect for me to understand the stories I am reading. I am going to use all the program that Kindle offers to readers like me and very happy to know that I will be increasing my vocabulary power as I read more. Thank you Kindle for all the help you have given me!!!"
M. Gastineau,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I found this to be too glitchy and slow for me to enjoy reading on. I purchased it so that I could read in low light situations and not use my phone (trying to get away from the blue light effect at bedtime), but I found that the glitchiness of the display and slowness of turning pages made me not want to keep it. It may be great for someone who can overlook these flaws, but as someone who is used to smoothness in her e-reader, this just didn't work for me."
Erin Franco,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally had a kindle years ago around when they came out. I looooooooooved it! When the kindle fire came out I traded in the old because I wanted to be apart of the tablet train. It was harder to use outside to read due to glare. I've had other tablets and same issue, can't read due to glare. I could not wait to go back to the paper-white style of kindle which I received for this Christmas! I've only been using it for a few days but it is so great. I can read in the sun with out the glare, I can read in bed with the light off, it's so light weight and compact. I did give it a 5 out of 5 but the only problem I have with it, is that holding it sometimes I do turn it off with my pinky (due to how I hold it) while I'm reading in bed. I'm so happy to have the paper-white style and would definitely recommend it to anyone."
MS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love my kindle paperwhite! Bought one for my mom also -she loves it almost as much as I do!

Monthly book club pairs very well with my kindle and I never run out of reading material. <3

However, the power button on the bottom is a total pain in the @ss! Turns off when I try to prop it up to read, bump it and it restarts, argh! Amazon PLEASE put the power button on the top (or side) on the next version. I will buy it specifically for that despite the fact I don't need another one!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for what I was looking for. Purchased for $130, but regularly on sale for under $100. More bang for your buck at that price; should be the MSRP. Very easy to read during the day, at night, and inside or outside. The charge is incredible; I’ve had it for a month and only charged it the day I got it. It comes with charging cable but not the wall adapter which is disappointing. Also, there should be a mid-level between this and the oasis that includes buttons to turn the page. Touch screen is fine but there isn’t feedback so I don’t know whether or not my touch registered. Overall, like I said, exactly what I was looking for without spending $250 for the oasis, which I think is overpriced. Overall, 5/5 recommend and would purchase again; I’m even thinking of getting a second one to replace the nook that we have."
blackgroban95,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I debated for a while on getting a Kindle Paperwhite. I’m an avid reader and wanted a device that holds multiple books. I didn’t like the idea of using the Kindle app on my iPad. I thought using a device with E ink technology would make reading electronically easier on the eyes. It exceed my expectation. The battery life isn’t perfect but can last a whole day and some. The backlight works great, especially for reading at night or on a plane, train, etc. The ads don’t really bother me. For its price, it’s a good little treasure. I highly suggest anyone try it out. I was nervous about going from paper to paperwhite but I’ve grown a love for both."
S. Richards,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, picture clear, and battery lasts a while. I've had it for about a month and have only charged it twice (both times the Kindle was still above 50%). There's a slight glare, but you can still see the screen pretty well. Haven't tested it in the sun yet. Super light and small enough to put in your purse/bag. I've been able to carry it in some pockets. Only issue I can tell is the touch screen is a little delayed, but you don't really get a paperwhite for tablet features, so I wouldn't take a star away for that.
I also like that you can purchase books straight from the Kindle. I'm not able to do that on the Kindle apps."
JOSEPH A RAPP,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my kindle paperwhite, much easier on my eyes, and less bulky than my phone or tablet, the charge lasts longer also, but I have not had it that long and now I am having a problem, it is stuck waking up, I know I have a hard time waking up sometimes but not over an hour or two. And it still hasn't woke up yet. I will contact Amazon in the morning and see what we can do."
Sola49,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is light. I had a Voyager before because it was the lightest Kindle available.
Five stars for Amazon, suddenly I could not get past the front page and send Voyager in as an exchange, I marked it as not being able to hold a charge and got the $5 + 20% off. A week later they e-mailed me that I had gotten a $45 gift card because the Kindle was in better condition, than I had indicated"
LShomepro,5.0 out of 5 stars,The input for password seems off. Love the battery life. Have had a Kimdle fire for many years and it wasn't holding charge more than 2 hours. I have read several days now and still have lots of battery life. No glare is terrific as well.
KF,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this a couple months ago when it was on sale. I was upgrading from the previous Paperwhite model. I've always kept my hand on the edge of my e-reader, ready to swipe the page. Would I do that with this model, it moves several Pages forward or back. I feel like this is a design flaw. The black area should be a dead zone. I frequently have to find my spot again. This happens even when I'm not touching the sides. The touch sensitivity is just off on this device. Hopefully a software update can fix this???"
Sam,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant because this had mixed reviews, maybe not a great upgrade from the last few Kindles. I had the original Kindle touch without any light, and loving this! Battery life is amazing, even with the light. I’ve had it for about 3 weeks, have read two and a half books, and battery is at 50%!"
Joyce,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm so happy to have a Kindle again. My recliner ""ate"" my last one. This Kindle is lighter in weight than my previous model and waterproof so I can read while soaking in the tub. I like it even better than my previous one!"
Carla S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle and so far, I like it a lot. Previously I read on a tablet with the Kindle app so the Kindle Paperwhite is definitely a big improvement. The battery life is pretty good considering I usually read for several hours a day. To date, I have only had to charge it once a week. It is thin and light and easy to hold. I like the touch screen and light. Works well for me."
Debra M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle purchase and so far I am pleased. I was reading on my iPhone (too small) or iPad (too big) and neither was a comfortable size, I couldn’t see the screen well outside- even in the shade- and they’ve actually overheated when trying to read in the sun. The Kindle Paperwhite is the perfect size to hold while reading and the display size is adequate so I don’t get eye strain. I haven’t had the opportunity to try outdoors yet so I can’t comment on how good the screen is on bright days. I took off one star because there is no option to reverse colors (white letters on black page) which is what I prefer for reading before bed. Otherwise, great product so far."
DLC SoCal,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Due to its much larger memory, I bought my second Paperwhite Kindle. So far I love it! One minor problem so far is that it sometimes turns itself off while I am reading or goes back to the Home page without my having asked it to do so. Hoping that goes away over time. Sure loads a lot of books and I keep up with adding new ones via free subscriptions online. I just could not afford the higher priced model so I am satisfied."
J D,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll make this short and sweet. You are an avid reviewer, just like me. You questioned some issues that you may have heard about the latest gen of kindle paperwhite. My experience has been phenomenal. Does its job, nothing more nothing less. Battery life is better than expected. Lighting is good - could be a little ""warmer"" for my eyes, but acceptable for sure. Keeps my books at my fingertips. No hardware issues to speak of. Great device."
Sierra,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I struggled reading books at desks, on the beach, and in bed. I just could not get comfortable. This allows me to lay in bed and be comfortable without struggling to hold the book up. I can read with the lights out without my eyes straining. The adjustable backlight helps in all settings. The light does not bother my eyes like a computer screen would so I was pleasantly surprised. Very simple to use, great battery life."
marilee mattson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I give it 3 stars because of it’s size. I am an old school Kindle user, I had one of the original versions. I was surprised by how Small this new Kindle is. I know that the screen is the same size as the old one, however I wish it was the size of a paperback book.
I do love the new and improved version with the screen swipe and the ease of use and navigation. I did do the research and paid extra for the version that has no ads... I just want to read my books! I am sure I will get used to it... as I did when I made the switch from books to digital."
Mysticmoods,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’d hoped the battery life would be a substantial improvement, but it’s only moderately longer Then my old paperwhite. I do like the lighter weight and the swimmer design. Overall I would recommend the new Kindle paperwhite to friends and family"
Elfie,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's extremely small do you can take it anywhere without the weight. I use it for audible books strictly.
I have found that the device times out pretty quickly so you have to constantly wake it up to turn it off..
It allows you to bookmark but I can't figure out how to get back to the bookmark. I can't figure out ifit's operator error or just a bad kindle ??
It's difficult to shop for books on it.
Way too small to see the book titles.
I like to shop"
Aryn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my kindle Paperwhite . I even upload the PDF’s I have to read for school onto it and read them on there, because it’s so much nicer to not have to stare at a computer screen to read pages, and pages of a document. I love the kindle unlimited as well. That way when I travel, I can just pick a new book, trade it out and start reading something new. It makes traveling lighter so much easier, because I don’t have to grab and carry multiple books, I’ve got all of them right in my hand.
The battery lasts FOOOOREVERRRR too! I don’t have to worry about charging it every night. I charge about once a week."
Joyce,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So now on my 5th Kindle...I did not know it came in blue!!! Bonus! Also, Amazon, I’m sending you my cat Milo, as product tester🤣. If he doesn’t break it, you’re good to go! He has a strong belief that everything must be shoved off counters, shelves, tables and then played with. My Kindle lost it’s battle with Milo and porcelain floor on 12/3...RIP Kindle 4. #5 will not be tested by him as he is currently on time out contemplating the Christmas tree😳"
Kelly S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the non glare screen of the Paperwhite. It is great for reading outside. The Paperwhite is perfect for reading in bed,it never bothers my husband. I have not had the need to check out the waterproof feature but, It is nice to know it's there. I received my last Paperwhite when they first came out. It still worked fine but, it was time for an upgrade. I am looking forward to many years with my new Kindle!"
KJB from DE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since my kindle was a 2nd generation this one is a miracle in my book. The reading screen is basically the same size and the touch screen is great. I also like the built in light (I had to buy a separate light for my old kindle but it would create a lot of glare). No problems so far and I've already read quite a few books. Still learning some of the shortcuts and how to navigate but the guide on the Paperwhite is easy enough to retrieve and find answers. However, I only use the Paperwhite to read books. I don't use it for anything else so can't comment on magazines, periodicals, subscriptions, clipping, notes, etc. Other than that, it is perfect for me."
Bc4rr011,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Paperwhite doesn't support the Sudoku game or any word games I had on my last one. I received the new Paperwhite and it wouldn't keep a charge for more than 2 hours. I returned it and replaced it with the one I have now. It charges up fast and keeps the charge and works great. Onr thing else: All my books were still there, but they were all in the cloud, so I needed to go through them and pull out the ones to put in my library that I hadn't read. No small job since I have over 900 books!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my original Paperwhite, especially because I could easily read in bright (outside) light. A great improvement over my earlier Kindles. This new Paperwhite seems to function about the same but has more storage. I doubt I'll need the waterproof aspect, though you never know when you might want to read in the rain :). I didn't really need two (nor, probably, do you) but the Paperwhite is definitely worth upgrading to just for ease of reading and avoiding eyestrain."
Kouri Carter,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife said I canr just accumulating so many books partly because of storage and because my job moves me every few years, but I've always just preferred the real thing. I did finally decide to give it a shot and I have to say I like it so much more than I thought I would. It's easy, convenient, and easy on the eyes. My only worry now is that books are too convenient; one click and its bought and sent to my kindle. Going to have to show some restraint I guess."
T. Boyce,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Paperwhite and I was surprised that it is even better than the first one I had. The battery does truly last like, forever. I rarely have to adjust the built in light as it seems to adjust to the perfect brightness that I need. BTW - my first Paperwhite was still in good condition and I traded it in to get the waterproof version. Fortunately, I don't have experience to tell you how great the waterproof works, but I am more comfortable taking it around water now."
voracious reader,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have purchased a number of Kindles and this one has been very disappointing. The battery life was supposed to be even longer than previous Paperwhite devices but the battery life never was very long. Now, after 8 months, the battery is totally shot. I am very annoyed it has lasted so poorly compared to my original Paperwhite. That thing was a workhorse and lasted for a number of years."
Priscille Paul,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my kindle paper white! BUT the charging cord is very difficult to plug into the device. after 20 minutes on the phone I’m told to order a Samsung replacement cord!! What? No, I want an original cord. Again, I’m told I have to order it myself. Why can’t you send me one Amazon? Apparently I have to order it myself and then ask for a refund!!"
John Lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's strength in simplicity, yet then the user is locked into the bias of the design team's choices.
Just like with my v.1.0 Fire, the on/off button is at the bottom - right where my finger might hit it - but unlike the (charging port problematic) v.1 Fire, I can't rotate the screen so it's at the top and out of the way like any reasonable user would be holding the device. Gotta just deal with it, since it's still the best choice.
But... Really? Doesn't your design bureaucracy ever use the device while reclining in bed? Like real people?"
L. Marshall,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this Kindle for a year now and am very disappointed. At the beginning I had minor problems of it skipping pages but it was minor. Now it not only skips pages more often, now it will just freeze up about every 6th time I try to download and start a new book. To fix it I have to go through the tedious process of shutting it down and restarting it!"
Ralph E. Curtis,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the new kindle after losing my previous one. Sadly I find the touch screen has been modified and will no longer respond to the tap of a pencil eraser. I'm a male military veteran and my fingers are not tiny enough to manipulate the keys for word/number entries or to bring up book titles from the library. It is time consuming and frustrating to use, not at all what I wanted and likely to wind up in a drawer."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love, love this Kindle. I have the keyboard kindle for over 10 years and wasn't sure about getting anew one, especially with the back lighting, but needing anew one and then being waterproof just sealed the deal! I am able to read outside just like my 1st kindle with no glare or problems and now I am able to read in the dark too. If you are on the fence about getting a new one, just hop off and order it now. It goes every where with me! It has been 2 weeks and I am still more than half on the battery. The waterproof cover is amazing also. Hurry and get yours today!!!!"
Christen,2.0 out of 5 stars,"As a first-time Kindle user, I was looking for something easier on my eyes than my iPad. It was easier on my eyes, lightweight and that’s about it as far as good things about this product. I immediately ordered a replacement after lagging response time with every touch and page turn I made. The backlight would randomly cut on for no reason and the “wakeup” period dragged. Scrolling through my books was a headache as the screen lagged 2-3 seconds or more after each touch of the screen. Amazon quickly responded to my issue and sent me a replacement that had the exact same issue as the first. I was hopeful for a positive experience, but its been everything but that. I guess I will just stick to books for now. I give this 2 stars instead if 1 for Amazon quickly sending me a replacement that unfortunately failed too."
Peter Laurance,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s super good at its job, which is letting me read books. The User interface is pretty confusing and terrible, emphasizing content for sale over content I’ve already bought. But it’s an amazon device, and amazon gonna amazon.

Once you’re in a book though, it is as close to paper pages as you could reasonably expect, and in low light situations (like when my wife is asleep and I’m still up with a book) it’s in-obtrusive and pleasant to read on."
eznor,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not what I expected. I lost my paperwhite and tried using a Fire 7. But, I missed the lightweight and simplicity of my paperwhite. Also, I was interested in the text to speech and was not available in the older model. The process of getting a feature that is supposed to be included was ridiculous. Especially, for someone who is not very tech savvy. The last problem is wifi connectivity. The new paperwhite will only connect to 2.5ghz and not 5ghz. This is most inconvenient. I will have to upgrade my modem to accommodate the paperwhite. Hidden costs."
S.B,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had 7th gen paperwhite for the last 4 years so decided to upgrade-trade in with special offer. It really hasn't changed much from 7th gen and one thing I don't like is the color of screen. This one has yellowish, brownish screen color I don't like while I prefer crisp and clean white screen color.
Battery life is not too impressive either. 7th gen I has lasted at least 4-5 days when this one only last about 2 days."
Mrsbulty,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for a trip we will be taking and have been using it outside and in our car. I have to say that there was no problem reading the print. Battery life has been excellent. I originally charged it at the beginning and it's been a few weeks now and still almost full battery life. I recommend this kindle highly. Can't wait to float in my pool this summer with a waterproof kindle.
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,I like the size and the fact that it’s lightweight. I got it so I could purchase books directly on the device and not have to go to Amazon. I do not like the black and white pictures of the books. I don’t like the way the pages “dissolve” instead of sliding or turning pages. Honestly I’d rather read on the Kindle app on my phone. I wish it was returnable but I disposed of the packaging.
Jean Zapf,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great reader. This is my first e-reader. I got the 32. I like that you can adjust the font and backlight easily. The text is clear and easy to read. It is very responsive. It is light and easily fits in my purse. Like any reader, I suppose, I like that it can sit on my lap or stand up on the table with the right case. It has taken some phone calls and you tubes to figure out some of the functions work. It would be very helpful if it came with at least a basic users guide."
MTG,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Kindle. I've been a fan for a number for a number of years. Convenience - I was at dinner last night and someone mentioned a book I would find informative, and right then and there I ordered it on my Kindle (almost too easy); enlarged typeface makes it easier to read for a longer period of time without my eyes tiring; slips right into my handbag; massive selection of books to choose from."
Aubrey S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new kindle paper white. It’s slim and sleek, I love that it’s waterproof so I don’t have to worry about my kid spilling something on it, or dropping it if I want to read in the bath tub. The battery life is amazing, and I love having as many books on there as I want! I’d definitely recommend the new paper white to anyone. It’s amazing!"
Katherine Geeser,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like the size and weight compared to my last one. Same screen size without keyboard. I love the touchscreen and swiping through pages over pressing buttons on the sides. It’s interface is more like my phone. Thank you for the improvements and lower price. I was really conflicted giving up my original for $5 when it had whisper net. I believe I’ll receive 25% credit when they receive my old one.
Dan P.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this so I could use it for my textbooks. I was really excited about it. The first textbook I tried to order wasn't compatible with the Paperwhite. Amazon customer service said there was nothing they could do about it because the textbook was in color... I was crushed. To be clear, this $130-$180 kindle is not compatible with a ebook textbook released in 2015. I couldn't use it at all. That's completely unacceptable, I had to return it."
Dan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Was surprised when my Kindle arrived in a padded envelope 😲! From the looks of the envelope I thought it was surely going to be broken, but it wasn't. Typical Kindle display and operating system. I find the touch screen slow and clumsy when it comes to it's responsiveness. Does what I need it to do otherwise, read books.
*Update*
Only used it for a couple days now with one book downloaded and already had to do a hard reset!"
foreverrefreshed,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kindle Paperwhite is so much lighter than a cell phone! I traded in my old kindle that didn’t have a touch screen and I’m so glad I did! So much easier to use. The battery is long lasting too! I read for about an hour two or three times a week and I haven’t had to charge it fiancé it arrived charged two months ago!
Pet Mama,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle, my second Kindle Paperwhite. I like that this new edition because it has more memory and because I can add audible books as well as reading books. The battery is good. It allows me to go several days without charging it. It is providing extra energy for the additional features and due to the large number of books I have on my kindle. I am glad I upgraded to take advantage of these new features."
Terry Cassidy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is probably the most useless product on the market right now. I have had an IPAD for years and needed to replace. I did not really want to buy another Apple product (I know stupid). I only read the papers on the tablet, so I really don't need all the functionality, so i thought in this day and age of technology a Kindle would be fine, but not the case. I spend a fair amount of money for online subscriptions to the WSJ and NY Post, and the Kindle does not allow you to use. You can buy the papers through them that you can use on the kindle (although reviews on them are pretty poor as well), but I know have a new night light for next to my bed.

Next time I see Amazon selling technology I will remind myself that it may be more fun to just burn my money."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read a lot, and I've owned several E-Readers. This one should do me for a while. I love that it is water proof because I take my reader camping. The direct WiFi connection to the kindle store is an awesome feature (I sprang for Kindle Unlimited) but I turn off the WiFi when not shopping to preserve battery life. I also like that I can connect to Calibre or any other E-Reader software to upload books I had on my old Nooks and Kobos."
Asia,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As a caveat to this review, this is my first e-reader. The battery life is phenomenal (I've used it daily for over 2 weeks and still have ~75% battery), the device is easy to use, and I'd definitely recommend it overall. There are just a few things, which may be common to other versions of Kindle and/or other e-readers that I think could be improved upon. The back lit screen works well, but is not very uniform; you can notice the text at the edges of the screen are slightly blurrier than the rest of the page. Secondly, I noticed the device is kind of laggy. I don't know if this is true for other e-readers, but I was a little disappointed with response time when utilizing the keyboard. It may be because I'm accustomed to using a regular tablet or mobile device with the Kindle app instead of an e-reader. It would be nice to eliminate that latency though."
A Shell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for myself for Christmas and I am so happy I did. I love the size and the fact I have my own little library in my hand. The battery life is amazing and I just love everything about the kindle paperwhite! I have not had any problems with the power button being on the bottom, I know other reviews mentioned that. Mine has never accidentally shut off. One of my favorite Amazon purchases ever!"
David Dailey,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My older Kindle with the touch buttons for turning pages as well as the same touch the screen to turn, was a better device.
This new one only has touch screen to turn page and I find this inconvenient when holding the reader in one hand and must use the other to turn the page.
As this was a gift, I can't complain too much, but I would have gone with a model a little higher on the ladder."
Mary,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love that I finally got into electronic books. This is my first and I done good! I have nothing to compare this with. I do know that I frequently need to wet my finger to turn a page or choose a subject. This is common for me. The light on the screen is fine for me, although I have only read indoors. If this is your first like me, carefully watch your books choices. I accidentally purchased books when I thought I was going to read and return for free. All ended up fine, tho. Very, very happy with my first Kindle😊"
Tom,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is a joy to use this device when reading. The only thing that I don't like is finding the book I want to read. It seems like it is designed to encourage you read another book instead of what you want to read. There is a relatively small link that you need to tap to get to your library. I have missed the link multiple times and I end up in a different book. Making the link use larger text would fix the problem.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read through many of the reviews and was a little worried I made a mistake in upgrading my old Paperwhite for this version. I’ve only had the new one for a few days, but I’ve got to say, I LOVE it. I’ve been waiting for a Paperwhite that had a flush screen with its bezels and this one is perfect. Some reviews mention not needing waterproof component, but I read in the bath and the extra peace of mind is great.

The one gripe I have is with the software, not the product- (as others have mentioned) the screen wakes at full brightness and then adjusts to your previous setting. This is fine 90% of the time, but if you turn the kindle on in a dark room, it’s blinding for a few seconds. Hopefully this will be fixed in a software update.

If you’re strapped for cash and have a previous version of the Paperwhite, you don’t have to upgrade since it’s not a totally revamped device. But if you hated the recessed screen as much as I did, this generation is well worth the upgrade with a couple additional perks.

Happy reading!"
Oli,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sometimes it wakes up pretty quick, but most of the time is soooo slow, like honesty 5 minutes!!! And every now and then I have to push and hold to restart it cause the screen gets blocked... Was hoping this would be an upgrade, and yes, built-in light is nice and all, but so many issues I didn't have with the older version.. Sad, cause I loved my old Keenie and wanted to love this one, too..."
Michelle,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am extremely disappointed, I specifically bought a kindle NOT A TABLET to avoid blue light when reading, I was thinking I would be able to turn off the backlight. I read in bed at night and looking at a blue light screen right before bed IS THE WORST POSSIBLE THING FOR SLEEP HYGIENE!! You can turn the light off but not having a backlight defeats the purpose of a tablet. Why not have a night mode?"
Sheryl Powers,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my Kindle for Christmas one year ago. A few days ago, I went to charge it and it wouldn't charge. Tried for a few days to troubleshoot it on my own (holding button in, changing chargers, leaving it charging overnight). Would not charge. Turns out the warranty expired 2 days ago (while I was trying to fix it!). They offered 15% off a new one, which to me was not sufficient. It was like brand new and obviously defective. Customer Service was horrible, especially considering how much we spend yearly at amazon. I expected the kindle to last longer than a year and will think twice before recommending it to anyone else."
David S,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very disappointed with the battery life of these paperwhites. Our girls had old e-readers (not paperwhites) for at least 2-3 years and dragged them around everywhere we went and they continued to work just fine. They were basically indestructible! We were so excited to upgrade them to paperwhites, but now, just over one year in, neither of them are working properly. One won't charge at all, and the other dies by the end of the day. Because our girls had kindles for so many years before these, they learned how to take care of them. This is not a user issue. I guess we got a bad batch. We planned on these lasting for at least 3+ years, but now here we are looking at spending $225+ to replace them both. It's very frustrating."
Suki's Mom,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Paperwhite to replace a Voyage that died a sad death. Compared to the Voyage, the Paperwhite is harder to use, and the process of downloading and finding books in my library is very kludgy. It has been a huge disappointment. Had Amazon still been making the Voyage, I would have bought another one in a heartbeat. Bottom line, based on the ease and functionality I enjoyed with my Voyage, they could do a lot better."
Elaine L. LaMagna,3.0 out of 5 stars,I like the new light weight Kindle and the fact that it is waterproof. The Kindle's battery depletes to one half in a day. Do not think this is as advertised. Apparently my opinion only matters when it is favorable.
gustavo bedoya,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this kindle for my wife, here's her review:

""This is my first kindle and I love it. I didn't think I'd enjoy reading on a device better than reading from a book, but it really feels much better on my eyes and is more interactive as I can look up definitions on harder reads. Although there are some bad reviews on the battery life, I can't say much except that it is really great for me because I only have time to read 20-40 min per day and the battery life lasted over a week. However, if you read hours per day, not sure how the battery is with that.
Overall I am so happy with my kindle and recommend it !"""
Sally,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the 9th Kindle I have bought for family, friends and myself and I do not like this one at all. The on/off button is
awkward and it is hard to hold the tablet without occasionally turning it off. Also, I do not like the new format of
the books that are listed and have previously been read or want to read. Wish they had stuck with the old style
as it was much more user friendly."
j7469,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having had a older device for the previous 4 years, I finally decided it was time to upgrade. This is for my wife who uses it daily. She enjoys this new model, especially for the piece of mind knowing she protected when she by the pool. The battery life and great and the device is responsive. Her only complaint is the the location of setting changed and it took her a while to get use to the. We location of the features."
Anastashia Beverhousen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to this from a paper white second generation I’d had for ten years. It served me well but started to glitch and lag badly.

I was unsure about buying a new one after reading the reviews but I’m glad I did. I loved my old kindle but I’m so glad I decided to try this out myself. It’s so much faster and nicer than my second gen.

I’m Dyslexic so I read almost everything on my kindle. I’m in grad school and I just love to read so the only down side so far is the battery doesn’t seem as good but I think if I turn the WiFi of it should last longer."
arkycatfish,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my new Kindle Paperwhite. Already had the app. on my laptop but it's more like reading a actual book on the Paperwhite. Also, something I haven't heard mentioned, it is a great space saver. I am a avid reader and have close 200 regular pocket book and hard cover books waiting to be read. Think of the space those take up!! With my new Kindle I have 93 books waiting to be read in one very, very small space. Love the Kindle Paperwhite plus the storage space it is saving me."
Nate,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s pretty cool. Super lightweight. It is a little smaller than I expected but that’s about my only gripe. I’d recommend helping anyone not tech savvy get it setup if giving as a gift - it takes a little getting used to.
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,First let me say that I do like my new paperwhite my issue I have is with the Kindle that I sent in as a trade in value. The original trade in value was 15.00 I almost didn’t send it in and considered keeping it to give to someone to use instead. The only problem with the trade in was a smudge on the screen that was there from the beginning a defect that I didn’t bother returning in that it was not that bad. Low and behold I just received an email say my trade in value was reduced to 5 dollars because of cracks on the screen. Now I know there were no cracks on the screen. So unless some one did it in shipping or when the package was opened I don’t know what happened. I packed it in bubble wrap so I doubt that it cracked in route. So beware everyone thane pictures of anything you use as a trade in!!!!!!
SCG,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 2nd Kindle. The original one was from 2010. Glad to be able to do the trade-in. I certainly got my money's worth with the old one and the tech for this new one was obviously much better. I just got it recently and have been using it every day. Very easy to use, lots of options, and I am sure I will remain happy. The back light makes things so much easier. I had to use a clip-on light with my old one but I tended to read in the dark so it got annoying. Kindle for life here."
RonC,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally, I discovered that the maintenance of my Kindle run from the Amazon website. There was a sample book on my Kindle and I could not find a way to delete it till I went to the website. Also, every time time i turn it on, it wants me to buy more books! I haven’t yet tried to read anything on it. I like the light form factor, but I am busy with a purchased hard copy right now."
Samantha,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded to this 10th generation from my 2017 paperwhite and I am severely disappointed. I loved my original paperwhite with backlight because it looked exactly like paper. It was an absolute joy to read before bed, so easy on the eyes. This new kindle has a blaring bright blue-tinted light. I have attached a photo of my two Kindles, both set at a brightness level of one. The difference is jarring. My eyes are sensitive and this new kindle is way too bright for me to read before bed, it hurts my eyes. I am reaching out to customer service to see if this is a glitch. But for now.. the photos don't lie."
B. Hotchkiss,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Even though this is my second Paperwhite and third Kindle, it's the first that I've really enjoyed using. Setting the adjustable light is simple and it provides fine tuning that will work under any external-light situation—even complete darkness. The wifi setup and implementation is far improved over the previous version. I had hoped the 6-month free trial of Amazon Unlimited would open new doors for me, but I've found little of interest in its extensive offerings and don't think it warrants prolonging."
orionredwing,3.0 out of 5 stars,I read the reviews but decided to get this new version as my current paper white has a small crack in the screen from being squished in my backpack. Unfortunately this new version is less bright and the screen is less white. Also the font doesn’t appear as crisp but it may be due to the lighting. I didn’t post a pic side by side as there are many other reviewers who did so but I wanted to reaffirm what others said that this version is not as good as previous. I kept it for my wife but I went back to using my previous paper white with the slight crack.
Ron Chrislip,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Wish the website would have said that the new paperwhite does not support active content and games like the previous one did. After receiving the new unit I tried to download my active content my library and could not to it. I called kindle support and was told that the new paperwhite no longer supports active content and games. Could have saved a lot of time if this
was mentioned somewhere on the new paperwhite description......"
Teknobubba,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an old Kindle I love, but it is losing its touch screen sensitivity. I have a Kindle Fire, but it's too heavy and has limited battery life. THIS new Kindle is, for the most part, excellent.
I really don't need the built-in light. I rather liked the older Kindle's screen. It took a while to find the sweet spot for the brightness on this new Kindle. I gave the built in light a three star review. Meh. Battery life does not seem as good as they claim. I've charged it twice in one week."
Margaret,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reading mostly at bedtime. It doesn’t fit in my hand in a comfortable way. My old Kindle was larger so I just held it with one hand. This is smaller and light and delicate but too big for two fingers and too small for my whole hand. I just need to get a case your something so holding it feels less awkward. It’s very functional and all it promised to be
Eddie Wils,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice size, and with the leather cover nice to hold. After reading all the reviews both on Amazon and professional reviews., I thought I was really getting something special for the price. What am using is fair and 3 star only. Sharpness and lighting and paging controls all fair nothing more. I had a Nook Glo light which I unfortunately desroyed, that was better then this Paper White"
Howard Postley,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The device, itself, is OK, but nowhere near perfect. It’s not as good as a print book. It is much more convenient. The UI needs some help.

I would have been happy with it except that I misunderstood the term of buying books. I thought (not Amazon’s fault) that when you buy a paper book that you get the Kindle version included with it. What you actually get is a partial version temporarily. I would have been OK with the extra-cost add-on that allows you to get both, but the set of books that are available doesn’t overlap well with what I buy, even though there are both Kindle and print editions. It’s also pretty expensive. I’m not prepared to buy every book I want twice. When they fix that, I’ll be a happy Kindle customer"
Peter Buchanan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is excellent and I can find no flaws in it so far except one little thing. Why did you change ""MY LIBRARY"" from easy reading in print form to the illustrated book covers of each book. It makes it more difficult and longer to find any book that you may have read already. Also, can you rearrange the books by author in alphabetical order?

A reply would be appreciated."
Samantha,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I went back and fourth reading other reviews, but I wanted a Kindle Paper White and I am glad I got it! It is slim, sleek and works like a charm. I love the paper white screen, I can literally read for hours with little to no eye strain. I enjoy reading again. I will say that for the price I expected the fluidity of the touch screen to be a little better, but it's minor and doesn't effect the reading."
Tiffany,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It was lighter and a bit smaller than what I was imagining, but it is a wonderful product! Even though I'd rather have the physical copies, this is rather practical to take with you on the go since it fits in my bag no problem. I haven't checked the waterproofing on it and I'm not going to unless something actually happens to it, then I will come and edit my review.

The only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is because when reading comics/manga on it, sometimes on the next page, you can see faint lines of the previous page overlaying it. I Think that's something that really need to be fixed."
Robert ES,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Unit was not working upon arrival. The screen was acting as someone or something was touching the screen, whether it was held or placed on the desk. It even ordered a book, since it was in my wish list, no big deal, but still annoying. I was given two options, full refund (which I took) or send it back to be repaired, or replaced with another refurbished unit.

Cut my losses and went with an Ipad."
Rachel Luehr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s perfect. I’ve waited years (and a cracked screen) to upgrade. I wanted something that made me want to switch in my older model, not another clone. This was it. This model now hosts my audible library, much to my delight- but that isn’t even my favorite part! IT IS WATERPROOF FOLKS. All bathtub/hot tub/white-water-rapids readers are rejoicing. As for the overall device; light weight, same slick design as other models, and it’s quick. This is a good buy for the reader in yout life."
Patricia A. Jones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked my original Kindle Paperwhite. Unfortunately, I somehow lost it in a move. I ordered the new one and although I like the features, I hate the small size. I realize it is more lightweight but I would rather it be heavier so I don't need to swipe to turn the page every two seconds. I am a fast reader so it really bugs me. I wish I would have taken the chance on a used/refurbished original Paperwhite."
Shaz L,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 7th Kindle and I’m extremely disappointed! The screen keeps freezing in the locked position and I have to reset every other day. And now, I’m having battery problems - plug it in, leave for 12 hours, says 100%, within a few hours it’s down to 15% and I’ve hardly read anything AND it’s on airplane mode!!!! So frustrated"
GinaCalifornia,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally broke down and replaced my 2nd gen kindle with the paperwhite. While my older kindle was still working fine, I did like the idea of the backlight (I had purchased a special expensive case w/ light for my older device) and liked how much lighter the paperwhite is. Once I figured out how to reduce the screen brightness I was hooked. I do miss the older less noisy home screen of my old reader but I rarely go to the home screen so it's not that big of a deal."
V,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first Kindle and I had very high expectations from it. I didn't like it at all since the contrast of the letters on the screen is terrible. It appears washed out. I see there are discussions about this on the internet, so it's not just specific to my device. I will hold off until the next version to see if the screen is improved then."
Ray F,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had a little trouble learning how to control things with the touch screen. My previous kindle had all those push buttons!
Especially had trouble learning NOT to touch the screen if I wanted to stay on the same page. Spent a lot of time asking myself ""Where did it go?"". But I think I'm over that now. Especially like the backlighted screen"
Krohnicus,1.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE - Well , I tried. Turned off my WiFI ... brought the light down to 6 and my battery was almost depleted within 2 weeks. I only read a total of about 3 hours a week. Boo on this device ... still switching to a Nook. UPDATE END — I use to love the Kindle Paperwhite — until they updated the stupid battery percentage — thanks Amazon. Now every time I turned on my Kindle, it reminds on how fast the battery is draining down. Boo on you for runining my love of this device. Switching to Nook."
S. Rhodes,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I replaced a 2013 Kindle paperwhite with this newer version. It appears to be the same thing that I had with a few improvements. The screen is better and more responsive. I use my Kindle a lot and my battery was having to be charged more often or i would still have it. This newer kindle has the power button the bottom. I turn it off by accident, regularly. I have to consciously avoid it everytime I change hands. Either recess it more or relocate it to top???"
Chase Butler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my kindle so far. It has become a part of my every day carry and I don’t see anything changing that soon. I love physical books and thought that might not translate well into reading on a kindle, but it took no time to become used to it. It’s size is also something I have come to love and it is very comfortable to read while laying down. The convenience of having a veritable personal library in the palm of your hand is a very impressive thing. A wonderful device that I can not begin to recommend enough. My only regret is not purchasing one sooner."
A. Carpenter,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m still getting used to it but love it so far. It is sometimes difficult to switch from using iPhone XS to Kindle and expect the same response /features - user issues only. I like the different fonts available and the light is perfect. Ive been reading in the dark in bed while on vacation and it’s perfect! I got the cover for it so it wakes and sleeps automatically - nice feature.
P. Galarza,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been reading odd of a kindle app for years, and 12 months ago I thought I’d take the plunge and buy the hardware. I love this paper white kindle for reading (easy to see day or night) but I hate the touchscreen for page turning. It has a lag that is way to antiquated for this day and age. The underlining and highlighting actions are clumsy. And despite all that I prefer to read on it over anything else. But just the day after I could no longer exchange it, it stopped working. A battery symbol with an exclamation point is displayed on my screen. I’ve tried all the tricks to revive it but to no end. Quite disappointed because given this period of self quarantine, I planned to reading a lot!"
Tiffany Smith,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really excited to get my Kindle Paper White, but was immediately disappointed. I guess after reading many reviews, my expectations were too high. I don’t think it’s as user friendly as some of the other Kindles and I’m actually not a fan of it’s smaller size, although the lighter weight is nice. My biggest complaint however is, it does not a hold a charge as long as Amazon claims. My battery lasts two to three days is all. This is the third Kindle I’ve owned and I think the quality is less and less with each one."
Jason,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the Kindle Paperwhite. This is my second one. Makes books easy to read anywhere. Fits in my purse so I can read while waiting for appointments. Can read outside without any reflection. Can adjust the font so I don't strain my eyes trying to read small print. I only have to charge it about once every two weeks. Great product at a reasonable price. Use it all the time.
T. Cantu,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give this 5 stars but there’s only one thing wrong with it. The way I hold it in my right hand and because the position of the power button along the bottom I am constantly touching the power button and the screen pops up that says “restart, screen, poweroff”. It gets very annoying. They should have put the power button on top or the side. But everything else is fantastic."
Robert G.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It`s just ok. I read a lot. The app or system that runs this thing needs a lot of work. I`'ve used the Android app for years to read and it is great. It's hard to find books on this and if you loose your place good luck. I have to go on my tablet to find a new book. I wish I had just bought another 7"" tablet in stead of this. The only good thing is the battery lasts a long time."
Michael R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite is small yet big on functionality. The backlight is helpful when used in rooms illuminated by typical table lamps. The display really shines under a desk lamp (see photo), and outside on a sunny day. 300 dpi adds crispness when using smaller fonts.

I recommend the Paperwhite over the basic Kindle. You get a lot for a few extra dollars. More storage, brighter backlight and nearly double the screen resolution. I opted for the Amazon waterproof blue cover so the Kindle will stand out, reducing the likelihood of my leaving it somewhere. Over time the Kindle Paperwhite can help pay for itself by making it easier for you to take advantage of the free books included in Prime reading.

My wish list is for a larger screen and more refinements to backlighting. But for now, the Kindle Paperwhite strikes the right balance of form, function and price."
Noreen,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use my kindle white for reading. This is my third one. I had trouble charging my first one so I replaced it. Then the new one came out and both my husband and I thought an upgrade was a good idea. We love them. We can take hundreds of books on vacation in very little space. Reading at night or in bright sunlight are equally easy. I highly recommend to all book worms.
Richard Byrne,4.0 out of 5 stars,I had an early generation Kindle reader with a button on the side to turn pages. I upgraded to the paper white with a touch screen and I like some of the features but not the touch screen. When holding the reader there is not much room between the edge and the screen all you have to do is accidentally touch the screen and the page jumps. To fix the problem I had to purchase a strap that attaches to the back which I can slip my hand through to hold it without my thumb being close to the screen.
Geri,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love this little guy. Lightweight enough to drop in my bag. Never have a problem reading in all sorts of light conditions. Battery life is great...going for 2-3 days and I read a LOT. Only thing I hate is that the power button is on the bottom and the screen does not rotate! If I prop it against something to read during lunch the power button is so sensitive that turning the page turns it off. I don't want a cover for it so I put up with the aggravation. All else it's a great machine!
Luke,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bought a lot of stuff for my Kindle and prior to this version I'd always had to juggle files around - deleting one to download another. No more! Lots of room is exactly what I'm looking for.

Smaller than previous models (thinner, rather) and when used with the official case, it feels good in the hand. I like that the screen and bezel are now flush: no more places for cat hair to hide.

On the negative side, it's not as snappy as my previous Paperwhite – there's always a little bit of lag. The power button seems to be more sensitive, as I find when reading in bed or holding it with one hand, there's many more accidental sleep modes invoked by brushing the button. Still, a worthy update, especially if you've invested in content for it."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a kindle fire before, and did not realize this has no internet access except to purchase books. That would be OK since I wanted it primarily for reading, but finding books to purchase is so much more difficult than on the fire that I use my laptop to search for and purchase books for my kindle. This is a hassle when traveling. The size and weight are smaller than expected, which is actually nice for reading. The lighting is easier on my eyes than the Fire. and much better outdoors. Excellent battery life. I would rate it higher if it was easier to locate, read reviews and purchase books."
Robert C. Chambers,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It seems that when I am reading it will go back to the screen with the boy under the tree and reload....it did this several times today while I was reading. I use it every day and it will re-cycle at least 3 times per week. you lose
concentration when reading a book. extremely aggravating. either the paperwhite is not as good as my old
kindle fire or it was not loaded or set up properly...."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second kindle ereader, my first one was over 10 years old and had the keyboard on it. It was much larger and heavier but I still carried it in my purse every day. This new reader is wonderfully compact and so easy to use. I am carrying it in my purse everywhere I go and I don't even know it is there. It took me a little while to get used to swiping instead of pushing buttons, and I am still learning how to use some of the functions. I wouldn't go back to my old one for anything."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product!! It is amazing and its great to use by the pool or inside on the couch! I do wish that the page transitions was smoother but that is my only complaint! I love this device !
mjw929,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I prefer my 'old' Kindle w/ the page turning buttons; easier to stay relatively still while reading as opposed to swiping. I was informed at the Amazon store that my collections would transfer automatically to the new Kindle, but they did not and I have had to go through HUNDREDS of books manually to put them in the finished collection. I also find it a little hard to hold, as it's a bit too small to keep your fingers off the reading area, which in turn often turns the page. Had my other Kindle not bitten the dust, I wouldn't have had to buy a new one."
Ms. Berry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my new Kindle Paperwhite. Its lighter, works great, got a great deal on the Kindle, cover and adapter. It has great features. Not my 1st Kindle but the 1st time I got one with special offers. Saved money and I don't mind the ads. They are not on the pages of the books so who cares? Definitely reccomend this new K to anyone looking for a new e-reader."
Joshua Perry,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently bought the 32gb version to hold all my Kindle books and .mobi books. This Kindle is perfect for what I need it for. The battery life is pretty good if you don't binge read for long periods of time. The only two things I don't like about the Paperwhite is that the screen isn't color like on the Kindle Fire I had and the touch screen lags sometimes. Other than those two issues I'm really loving the Paperwhite.
Samsung,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The kindle paperwhite is the best kindle on the market. I recommend getting it with ""special offers"" aka ads. You only see the ads on the screen saver and most of the ads are offering you discounts on books!

I was skeptical about switching to e-readers from paperbacks but I am happy I did. It is much easier to lay in bed and not have to turn pages, adjust the book, etc.

Plus, you can buy almost any book for $10 from the kindle store which is cheaper than the paperback price."
R. P. Dedic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to read on the iPad using the Kindle app. It’s fine but I developed carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands. The Kindle Paperwhite is both light and convenient. I don’t have to do mail or social media when I read and it goes anywhere easily. My wife is a great shopper but I’m not so much on dresses. I find a chair and read while she shops to her hearts desire. It goes to the beach, to the pool or on hike beaks...no problem, man."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It is an ebook reader. Nothing special about it. Amazon has been churning out these for years. With that being said I am dismayed at a very stupid design decision: power button sits at the bottom edge of the reader. Because of that, any time you try to prop your reader on a hard surface, like a table or a desk for instance, the reader will turn off. One star review is not because I cannot use the reader or because it is broken. It is because it gets frustrating when for the n-th time the reader all of the sudden goes blank when you try to rest your hand that holds the reader on the desk and the edge inadvertently touches the desk and presses the power button.

Also, the back light has only one color - white (which in some situations looks blue) There are readers out there that can change the color of the back light allowing for a less eye straining color without the blue tint."
Keith W,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been really pleased with my Kindle Paperwhite the last few months. I had the Gen 1 and Gen 2 Kindles with the e-ink display as well. I love the battery life on these. The back light is fully adjustable for the perfect brightness to match the room. I also like that you can turn off the back light and WiFi in order to extend the battery life even longer. The fact that it's waterproof is amazing as well. I'll definitely be using it by the pool.
Mary Ann Liebert,2.0 out of 5 stars,I am a voracious reader! This kindle isn’t as easy to figure out so I’m not purchasing books as is my wont. Even adjusting type size is harder and sometimes it skips a page. Can’t get a previous page . Dictionary pops up constantly whether I want it or not. Home page was easier on the original . Customer service tries to help but reps for whom English is not native language are difficult to understand.
Terrie M.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Battery life is horrible. Claim is “weeks, not hours.” I’m disabled & don’t watch TV. I love to read so I do it almost all day. I have to charge it every night. It starts at 100% but ends the day around 20%. So if I forget to charge it, I’m screwed the next day if I try to take it out with me. My 1st gen kindle had a better battery life. That one lasted days.

I like the fact that this has dark mode for when I have migraines. However, it’s really stupid as it flashes super bright white each time you go to the next page, making the dark mode pointless.

It’s nice having a backlight & stuff & it’s very light. But it’s just “meh “."
James T. Elliott,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is my second Kindle. The old one works fine. I bought the Paperwhite to improve the lighting and have choices of font style and size. I am frustrated with the Paperwhite because I cannot figure out how to work it. Instructions are inadequate--at least for me with limited eyesight and not being tech savvy. If you buy a Paperwhite I urge you to be sure to secure a printed manual with LARGE PRINT and a tech-savvy teenager to set it up.
Joseph Cowan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ha a visual condition called Fuch's Dystrophy. It makes everything fuzzy owing to the cornea delaminatting. EReaders do poorly at night as the fonts fuzz out with white background. Now that the paperwhite 4 has the ability to invert to white text on black background I was finally able to easily read at night and in bed. It took almost forever for it to happen, but thanks for adding this valuable feature to the lower cost devices."
Eve,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love how lightweight it is, the battery love, the backlight.

Cons: the location of the power button. If you want to read while on a treadmill or bike, you can't set it down without hitting the power button and turning it off. Super irritating. Seems like a major design flaw."
Becky,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this so that I could use my same device for reading and audible. I can't read using the kindle fire, the glare hurts my eyes. Unfortunately there is no audible sleep timer, which makes audible unusable on this device for me. It has been returned."
SBaird,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it. I'm obsessed with reading again. Its fantastic screen makes it such a phenomenal book imitation, i.e., it seems so authentic except for the lack of paper pages to turn. Also, it's battery life is unbelievable. I use it everyday and maybe charge it every 2 weeks.

My only suggestion is to increase the responsiveness for the touch screen/software/operating system as it can have 1-3 second lags that make you doubt that you touched the screen correctly and that's frustrating.

Overall, great value for the money and an outstanding solution for having all of your books with you at all times."
Bronz,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very Basic, Black & White only. Only a $129 book that isn't easy to navigate"
TBAbby,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The paperwhite is great for reading books. I had used a kindle fire previously until I dropped and broke it. I'm having difficulty adjusting to navigating the paperwhite. My biggest issue is holding it to read due to arthritis in hands. I need a case with a strap to slide my hand through.
I like that the type size is easily adjusted, and the backlight is great! It is light and portable....better than Fire."
janice thompson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I try to read on this new paperwhite it keeps turning off every 5 minutes and then reboots and the in 5 minutes does it again. I have gone to settings and restarted it from there back to factory settings with no luck. The screen keeps saying: ""CANCEL RESTART SCREEN OFF"" over and over a gain. Because of Covid-19 I get get anyone at Amazon to help. I will send it back."
Da Lowrider,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had a few Kindles. The last one I had was a previous incarnation of Paperwhite. One day it died and could not be revived. I wasn't happy about that but my desire to see in the dark overpowered my chagrin about the durability of my last Kindle. So .. rolled the dice hoping this one lasts. So far .. so good.
Mary M Rao,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my favorite Kindle so far. It’s overall easy to use and makes reading more of a pleasure. My complaints? There are two-turning pages either forward or back can be a bit clumsy, and it does not show pictures, maps, and drawings well. This limits utility for some books. Lightweight, with plenty of storage, the cost is reasonable. I especially like to use it at night when I can just close it up when done and go to sleep. Not even a light to turn off."
cchnryz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an owner of the original paper white,I didn't think it could be improved upon. I am so glad I was wrong! The new one is bigger and lighter than before. The waterproofing is icing on the cake. As someone with eye problems there's even more settings than before which make it easier to read. The screen is also more smooth, more like a tablet. I received the New Kindle Paper white for Christmas. Best present, I thought I loved my old one, if so I adore the New one. Way to go Amazon, you hit it out of the park! As an avid reader, thank you."
crazycat,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had this for about a week and the battery is still 85% full! However, I went to read last night and it didn’t “wake up” when I opened the case. I decided to wait until this morning and it was still the same. So I pressed the reset button for 20seconds and it started to work again.
I don’t know what happened but I’m glad that it started to work again.
If it happens again I may contract customer service."
Allen B Shao,3.0 out of 5 stars,"brand new, second time charge over night. screen frazed with a battery sign and a ""!"" at center. press and hold ""reset"" button for over 20 seconds under direction of a amazon tech support, system was still frazzed. returned. A new one was on the way even before i sent it back to a ups store."
Vicki,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had a basic Kindle for a long time but decided to update to the Kindle Paperwhite. I was primarily interested in having access to the lit screen. I also love that it is light weight and resists water. Thank you!
Lynn10,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the new kindle paperwhite as a Christmas present to myself and I am quite pleased with it. It is lightweight, functional, full of storage, and has great battery life, especially when the wifi is deactivated. I particularly like how my old books synced to the device in the appropriate 19 collections. Plus, I like being able to adjust the lighting of the device and it has a brightness range from 1 to 24. Having had a kindle fire in the past, I am pleased by this change because the kindle fire is entirely too bright even on the lowest setting. That said, I have been able to read comfortably in all types of settings, day or night."
Contradictional,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Cons:
Power button is on the bottom, so when its sitting down it often gets triggered. Also the screen orientation cannot be flipped upside down, only sideways.

The charging port is on the bottom as well, so no charging if its being propped up.

When you use the ""invert color"" mode the light settings change and you cannot completely turn off the light."
Chuck Cooke,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this Paperwhite reader for my spouse to replace her Kindle fire which was at least four years old. Wife says she likes the smaller size and is easier to hold on to with one hand. She likes the white page look. She likes that it is not for browsing the internet so no distractions from the book she is reading or other software complications. She hopes it will work while reading outside in natural light but has not tried it that way.
RODNEY,5.0 out of 5 stars,It took a while to get used to it. I've had an older one and didn't notice a difference at first. But after a while I realized that the light was a lot better and the battery did last longer. I read a few hours a day so I only get about two weeks of battery life. But this one charges faster. I'm looking forward to using this at the camp site this summer and not be afraid of it getting wet and ruining it.
Jilllylane,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The paperwhite is good for what it is, but I have the following issues.

The screen brightness seems to be set and not able to be adjusted or it is so hidden that it is virtually impossible to find.

The screen is jumpy and reloads all the time

The ""experimental"" web page is a joke and really should be dropped or replaced

For reading a book it is great if the can clear up the page. If you want it for magazines as well dont bother, spend the extra money for a color kindle."
Claudejer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally upgraded from my 1st gen Paperwhite and am so happy I did. The text is much clearer and sharp, the light is very evenly distributed and the UI is more responsive.

I have read complaints about glare but have had no issues reading outdoors in bright light. I haven’t tested the waterproof features and don’t plan to.

Highly recommend this Paperwhite."
ErynJojo,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an avid book reader and I loved the idea of getting a new paper white to reduce my carbon footprint and try going digital. Mistake. I had to get a replacement for my original one and the replacement was the same. Super glitchy, hard to read, no smooth page scrolling. Over-all, this needs some work."
Kindle Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Kindle anticipating that the ability to vary the size of all the type sshown would restore the ability to read easily to my aging eyes. Unfortunately, only acquired type can be enlarged. None of the type inherent in the operation of the device can be changed in size, and thus renders the device to be of limited use. Recommended only if one can read the consistently small print by which the device is operated and maintained. Had to return it. Amazon was prompt with a refund."
fwreader,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this (my 5th Kindle) just for reading books.
Lightweight but a bit too wide to hold easily. It’s awkward and kind of a step backwards from previous Kindles. Filing/sorting is not simple. Too many steps to each function. No ability to not have a cluttered home screen.
It’s just OK. It’s nice to have the light for reading in bed but as a whole- very unimpressive. My first Kindle was purchased in 2010. You had to get a little clip on light -
Filtering and sorting on that one was preferable to the Paperwhite 10th Generation."
Thomas E Carman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a very nice product, and works well. Having previously used the Kindle Touch, there are some things I don't care for but I knew about them going in (no speaker, no audio jack, no true TTS function). I am still getting used to the ""home page"" setup instead of defaulting to the library all the time. It does have the advantage of easy access to several books at once, instead of having to go find a book after closing it to look at another."
Linda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it. I read every review. Maybe the first batch of paperwhites had a glitch. Years ago I bought a nook when they first came out. It was clunky to hold and very limited book options, I hardly used it. I've had no problems that were addressed in reviews. The battery life is great. Chargers quickly. I keep it on airplane mode. It's comfortable to hold. Pleased with the various setting options. The lighting is good. I bought the 32g, yes it's excessive. Some years back I lost all my physical books. Ill be replacing my favorites as well as adding new releases. The paperwhite price was good no complaints. I'm glad I purchased it."
Zarinah MUhammad,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not for me! I feel like a dummy. I'm new to Kindle and I thought all e-readers were pretty much all the same like a nook. WRONG ! No web browser, no other apps except for audiables and Goodreads ugh! Im heavily into using my library apps on my phone and wanted use this ereader for Libby and rb digital. I'm so angry at myself for not researching this better. I even thought I did my research by going on YouTube and searching for top e-readers . Yikes I did a poor job. I'm aware that overdrive / Libby has some books readable on Kindle but not all and if I download it on Kindle I would have to use Kindle app on my phone. Boo hoo I think I will send back and get a nook . I'm so disappointed."
Matthew Rodatus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this for its waterproofness and backlight. However, I dislike the touch screen. The bezel is too small and the front and back materials too slippery for me to hold this Kindle with a single hand. And then, if I do manage that, it's even more difficult to turn the page. To fix this issue, I suggest making the bezels bigger, the material more gripper on both front and back, and, ideally, add page turn buttons rather than requiring use of the touch screen to turn pages. That would make one-hand reading much easier."
Joyce A. Palmer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Kindle Paper White is so light and easy to carry. The battery seems to last a bit longer than my previous Kindle. This is my second Paper White. I had the Oasis, but find that I prefer the Paper White as it is more book-like in my opinion. The outer page turner on the Oasis caused me a bit of trouble as my thumbs would always accidentally turn the page. I believe that feature could have been turned off. I recommend the new Paper White!"
Bill Matthews,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Paperwhite. I've had the first one for several years and was very satisfying, however it was beginning to show it's age, especially with the battery. So, I finally decided to make the change and I have no regrets. I did buy a cover because I like the on/off feature and desire to protect the screen. The new ereader also gave me a reason to do some reorg and cleanup of my library of books."
Nancy M,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this on a whim. It was on sale for Amazon Prime day. I had been curious about it for a couple of years. I am not a big reader. I read mostly on vacations and LOVE getting a book and holding it in my hands and turning the pages. So I wasn’t sure if I’d like reading on a kindle. This device has surprised me - in a good way. I love using it! I love the lightweight feel of it and the fact that I can read in any kind of light. I find that I am reading way more because of it! I downloaded the Libby app and am getting books from my library for free too! I look forward to reading with my kindle every day. Pleasantly surprised. I find I am actually learning more too! The kindle allows you to select words you don’t know and learn the proper pronunciation and definition. That is a great feature!
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle had a very convenient headphone jack that allowed my to listen to books when traveling. It also had a speaker and I was able to have the book read aloud or listen to music files when reading. All of these have been removed to the detriment to the value of the reader. You have to connect the reader to a blue tooth device to get any sounds out the Kindle This is not practical on a bus, train or airplane. The sort function is primitive at best, only allowing sorts by author, title and most recent. If you have to move books around in order you have to use the recent function and then open and close each book manually. It very easy to accidentally open a book thereby inserting it into the group you wanted to form."
Dan_S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third kindle e-reader. I must say that this is the best one so far. The built in light really makes a difference when reading. I can adjust it to make reading very easy on my eyes. The battery life is excellent, I only recharge it about once a month and I read a few hours every day. Storage is great. I love the concept of holding hundreds of books in the palm of my hand."
B Cox,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the new paperwhite. It is lighter and smaller and fits in my purse much better. All of my books moved over and it is easy to set up and use. I like the flat display and not having an edge to catch dirt or debris in. It is easy to clean the screen. So far I have not had to test the waterproof feature but will be happy if it works. I lost my last device to a drop in water.
AbuelaLinda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It holds lots of books (I probably have about 800) and I love all the features. I had a 2013 Paperwhite so it isn't that much different. I love most that it is easy to travel with and to read in the middle of the night when I wake up and want to fall back to sleep. And when in lines at the supermarket, the doctor's office, etc. I carry it with me often so I am not stuck waiting with nothing to do or read but old magazines."
K B Reader,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There were several useful improvements to the new edition. One that was confusing at first was the battery charge indicator being black instead of white, but easy to figure out after wondering why it wasn't charging. It will take a little getting use to after 6 years with the original version. The new on is noticeably thinner. But also lighter, and the screen easier to keep clean as it's not recessed."
Elizabeth Majors,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband got me the new kindle paperwhite for Christmas and I absolutely love it! I have already read one full book on it, in the middle of another, downloaded a few others and then I activated the kindle unlimited subscription trial that came with it. I have one of the first kindles they ever released (with the keyboard attached), so it was finally time for an upgrade. I really love the extra storage and the backlight, so I can read anywhere. It's easy to turn the pages and you can change settings to whatever you like. I definitely recommend this product. :)"
Kathy Rinehart,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like it. I had an older Kindle but the battery was not lasting more than a couple of days. I read A LOT. The new paperwhite was easy to set up and my books transferred without a problem. It charges quickly and lasts up to a week, using it everyday, several hours a day. It is lightweight making it comfortable and easy to handle. The light has no glare. I really like it."
J. Wilson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Like:
Small
Easy to hold
Lightweight
Backlight allow you to read in dark and is adjustable

Dislike:
Space Not upgradable (I still have my original an it is great to just swap out cards)
Slow- doing anything other than reading is painfully slow. Changing menu-slow, download an audiobook-slow etc.
User experience - user interface is a disaster- finding stuff is not obvious by any means. On a device like this I should not need to search for things."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought I would switch from books to an electronic reader, but I am happy I have. I love the size and portability of the Kindle. I can hold it in one hand and it’s about the size of a book without the thickness to make it bulky. I also love being able able to read without glare in the car and outside. The only thing that would make it better is if it had color and if the home button took you directly to view all of the books in your library. Really this is 4.5 stars because of those things."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I would not have bought this if I knew that you had to pay 20 extra dollars to get ads removed from it.
The ""Special Offers"" that is included with it is literally ads that will harass you every time you open the screen, these ads CANNOT be deactivated on the Kindle itself, you will need to go to log into your amazon account via a web browser and pay money to not get harassed by ads LITERALLY EVERY TIME YOU WAKE THE DEVICE UP!

Cool device, good battery life but seriously scummy move on amazons part....."
Raymond,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Small, lite, useful day or night with a battery to last pretty much covers it. I have had Kindles since version 1 and each has it's nitch with this Tenth gen checking off even more of the check marks. Most of my reading doesn't require color so with this one going from dark as night to bright as day with clear legible text I'm not sure what else there is to mark off. Amazon keep up the good work, thanks.

Raymond"
Mury2202,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this. I have a smartphone, I have a tablet. I have a laptop, and a desktop computer. What I wanted was something to READ on. I wanted something I could carry with me, quickly read a little, and not be distracted by social media (yeah, yeah, I know!)

This hit ALLLLLLL the marks. I had already had Kindle Unlimited, but this makes it so much better having my library at my fingertips. I've also been a long time Audible subscriber, and the integration of that is also fabulous (although, I haven't used it yet).

I picked up an aftermarket case on Amazon and it's perfect! I love everything!"
NextBoat,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the built in light. Makes it more usable, and great at night in bed without bothering my wife. I’m disappointed that I can’t shift the background to black and the text to white as I could in previous kindles. That makes it easier on the eyes at night. Also, I signed up for Kindle unlimited which offered books in both text and audible format. The first one I downloaded did not come with an audible format as described. This 2 things made me take one star away from perfect."
Traci,5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE LOVE LOVE MY KINDLE. I am so pleased with this purchase. Because of its cost it took me a long time to actually buy it but I am so happy I did. I read some not so great reviews and was a little hesitant but wince Amazon has a great return policy I gave it a shot. I have not seen any issues with this little baby. I dont have an older version to compare it to so if you have never owned one I highly suggest this one. So happy.
Jessica A Cooper,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second paperwhite that I've purchased. This one feels a little lighter than the older one. The battery life has always been excellent, but the biggest perk of this model is water resistance (great for poolside reading). Set up was easier/faster than I recalled. The touch screen can be a little slow to respond but overall it is very easy to use and easy on the eyes. I'd definitely recommend over reading on a phone or iPad."
Timothy A. Curry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Major upgrade over my previous Kindle - this one is thin, has much improved battery life, and a backlight that makes it easy to read in all light levels. Only one external control, for power on/off, and one external port, for recharge and data. That's it, everything else is touch-screen. If you want sound, it must be Bluetooth. Excellent screen resolution and faster response in search and page turning. I'm an older guy and had been getting to the point where an hour of steady ready was giving me blurred vision; not so at all with this unit. Highly recommended."
Maureen Rivelli,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this in July and it is already broken!!! Never dropped and ALWAYS in a case. It just stopped working and froze. It wouldn’t reboot and I was on line with support and then a supervisor. They wouldn’t send me a new one until a week or I could pay $15 extra if I want it now!! This is ridiculous!! I cannot believe what a lemon I got!!! I read EVERY DAY!!! I’m sooooo upset with Amazon and this product!!! I’m going back to my iPad!!!!
Lizzy,4.0 out of 5 stars,I gave this new Kindle Paperwhite a less than five star rating because of the USB cable sent with it. In fact I had purchased two new Kindles and both did not fit. Amazon sent me two new cables. My daughter has not opened hers yet but my new cable is VERY TIGHT AND HARD TO INSERT. I am less than pleased.
Maureen Klaren,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So I bought this with a 2019 Moko case in Feb. of 2020 and the case does not fit. Are you seriously selling a 2018 model as ""new"" in 2020? Nowhere on the site is this Kindle referred to as a 2018 model. The case says it fits 2019 model which normally should not be a problem, but it is obviously a lot different. I would like to return case, but now Amazon does not take returns after 30 days??? What gives? This is certainly not what I would consider even satisfactory customer service. Help!"
Judy,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had surgery in my neck and it is difficult to hold my head in one position to read books. I LOVE my kindle. I can move it to any position I want and increase the font to read better. It goes to the next page with barely a touch to slide...and has numerous fantastic books. I read 3 books in 1 week and haven't been able to read in years. I totally recommend this for people with physical disabilities or for just anyone to make reading easier!!!!
Patrick H. Wynne,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you love to read ebooks, then you need a Kindle Paperwhite! It's the perfect reading tool. You can read for a ridiculously long time on a single charge, you can read it in anything from full daylight or full darkness, the fonts are scalable, and it's thin and light and designed to operate while holding it with just a single hand. And unlike reading using the Kindle app on an iPad, you're not constantly interrupted by alerts from social media etc., or tempted to check out Facebook or whatever — in other words, the Paperwhite helps you stay focused on READING! Finally, I love the small size, about the height and width of a mass-market paperback, which for me has always been the perfect size for convenient reading."
Victoria Armstrong,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my kindle. It was a Christmas present from my boyfriend and is just so wonderful. I can adjust my brightness to meet my needs of too much or too little surrounding light. It’s lightweight and easy to keep up with. I have tiny hands - extra small glove size - and have no issues with keeping it in my hands and using it. I have not had to worry about utilizing the waterproof features but am super glad to have them - the instructions on what to do if it gets wet are also super easy to follow. Definitely recommend.
N.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The goal of this product is to help you read. It’s great for that. The other functions still could be more intuitive and user friendly. For example, it’s difficult to browse your library, highlighting is not simple and the menu is kind of cluttered. The touch screen is certainly not as quick as your smartphone, but it’s okay.

My biggest wish is that you could swipe, and not just tap, to the next page while reading.

Again, this is for reading books. If that’s all you use it for, you will love it."
Dee S,3.0 out of 5 stars,I used the old style Kindle for years and loved it. However it finally just quit - wouldn't charge or turn on. I ordered the new Kindle but really miss being able to turn the pages with just a flick of my thumb on either hand. The new 'swipe' system is much more difficult and pages can only turn forward by swiping on the right side & sometimes has to be repeated 2 or 3 times. It is also more difficult to find my library listing.
Judith Cannon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my Kindle and realized the charge lasted less than a week. I contacted customer service and was sent offshore immediately even though it was normal business hours. I followed the instructions by someone whose name I can't pronounce to no avail. Cannot talk to an American and after reading all the reviews about the battery life I realize it's a fact. I charged it fully December 23 and it's now the 27th and has 35% charge left.
Terribly dissapointed in this Kindle."
Janice S.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received my paper white. I am totaly frustrated, this is not easy to use. I can find no way to make the font larger. I'm not young and need to have a larger print. I've tried settings over and over. If this isn't possible I will have to send it back and I love how light it is to hold."
Amanda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to get the paperwhite because using my phone to read was too stressful on my eyes and causing headaches, even with the blue light filter. I am enjoying it so far. I haven't had any issues with the device. My only complaint is that the length of the charging cable is quite short but since the battery life is amazing it isn't a frequent issue. I got this paperwhite maybe two weeks ago or so and it is only at 80% with that single charge on the night I got it. I would definitely recommend this for people who have issues with eye strain and headaches or just want an e-reader without all the extra stuff that comes with a tablet!"
Alexandra,4.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve had a few kindles now and I normally use them until they die on me. I like this new one. I find it very easy to use. I would have given 5 stars but the battery sucks. It states it should last weeks on a single charge but I’ve charged it at least 5-6 times since Christmas (I’ve been plugging it in when I get to about 30%). So it maybe lasts about a week if you’re a serious reader
catprincess,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is a waste of money because it will require you to have access to WiFi to read books. If you have no WiFi then you cannot read a dam thing! You can’t even download a book to read latter because it has to access it from the cloud. The first kindle e readers did not require this. So keep your money unless you will have access to WiFi at all times. I feel that Amazon could let customers know this before purchasing this useless product.
Gary L. Olsen,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm still working with this, but currently the touch screen is far to sensitive, I'll touch the screen and it will flip to many pages, and when I turn it off it either doesn't keep my previous sport, or I accidentally hit the screen and it starts flipping pages. Then I have to search the book to try and figure out where I was. This has turned into a lot of frustrating lost
reading time. and the book scares me to even pick it up."
JT,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall the device is great, my only issue is the touchscreen can be a bit delayed in recognizing an action.

My big issue is the sorting functions. I should be able to sort by series and see which volume in a series a book is, but that is not possible. So your options are to rename a book to say something like ""Lord of the Rings: Volume 2: The Two Towers"", or you have to use another device to search online what Book the Two Towers is in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Obviously I know it in this case but for series like the Pendergast Novels it is next to impossible to Know. And Start Wars Books are a nightmare to locate."
Monaco,4.0 out of 5 stars,I moved from a Kindle Voyage to PaperWhite with the promise of a longer battery life. I don't see any difference. I read approximately 3-4 hours/day and need to charge every night. WiFi is disabled unless I need to sync.
Alise L Orlando-Aly,5.0 out of 5 stars,What I don’t like about is that it doesn’t have a speaker on it u have to use a wireless headphone it u want to hear a story u can’t even use a regular headset that the worse part about it but other than that it great.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a tech enthusiast, getting my hands on the E Ink displays was an absolute treat. It's interesting tech, and really does give excellent battery life (which for a book is an excellent feature). It does take a little getting use to, especially because normal devices now are extremely responsive and have very fluid controls. You should know that to update the screen requires a lot more work comparatively to simply showing an image on the screen, and because of this there are no animations or other types of smooth transitions between screens.
I also need to note that the backlight is perfect. It has options to go from off, to extremely dim, all the way to a high brightness. When I read in bed, I need to set it to the 5th lowest brightness because the others are too dim for me. That range is amazing because it means you are never stuck with a super bright device all the time.
Excellent product, and highly recommend"
Courtney,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never owned a Kindle before so I did a ton of research before purchasing. I knew I didn’t want a tablet type screen but I also wanted to be able to use the light when needed! I have seen several customers compare this one to previous models and not as happy with it, but I absolutely love it! The battery lasts weeks and I have been reading most weekdays for an hour - 2 hours a night. It’s super light and easy to hold in one hand. The only negative that I have about it is that the power button is on the bottom right side and I have to make sure I don’t accidentally hit it and the back light go off. I’m very glad I got it because it’s super easy to send PDF book files to it and read immediately."
DJS,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have been very happy with my Paperwhite Kindle so far. I have only had it few weeks. I would have only two suggestions so far. (1) I Wish the built in light had a few brighter settings. I find myself setting it at almost the top setting. (2) I wish the highlighting could be done in colors. The only highlighting option I could find is to do it in grey.
R Lovitt,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish I had my old Kindle back -- the touch pad was perfect. The touch pad of the new version does not allow browsing the library by tapping on the right side of the pad to go to the next page. It requires using the ""Go To"" feature which is very cumbersome. The touch pad is also over sensitive while reading. This is the reason I wanted to exchange my new Kindle for another one thinking it was a problem with the pad I got. But no... the new one has the same issue. VERY BAD CHANGE from earlier products. BTW, I told the representatives (all 4 of them) I talked to about the exchange what the problem was and they apparently did not know it was standard in the new ones. The exchange was an unnecessary hassle."
susannah W,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wasn't sure I would enjoy a Kindle, thought I preferred ""real"" books. I am greatly enjoying it. I check out books from the library without leaving my house so have a huge selection. I like being able to use the dark background and light letters at night if I can't sleep and that way don't bother anyone. Glad I got it."
David Martin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually read from my tablet, but it gets tiring. I decided to get one of the kindle paperwhites when it was on sale and it is great. Very easy to read.

I do wish that there was a setting option to reverse the page turn buttons, so that I could go to the next page with my left thumb when I am reading with one hand rather then needing to touch the right side of the screen."
Shabnam Hasanalizade,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using it for about a month. So now I can write my opinion about it.

Pros: I like the screen, it looks like the paper itself if you don't concern the fact that it is a little glare. I prefer to read without built-in light, but in dark conditions, built-in light is useful. The material of the back panel is pleasant to the touch. Battery life is perfect, it never ends :-)

Cons: What I don't like is a slow response to the button. When I press a button to activate an e-book after a long time (a few hours) it's waking up takes as long as 4 seconds and the same period when I press the button to lock screen. Besides, when the e-book is in my pocket a button pressed unwillingly due to my movement. If at that moment your hand is in your pocket the screen activates and you can easily lose the place you left off reading. Another con is the backside - it is easy to get dirty and spots remaining."
Susan L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the new features on this Paperwhite---larger storage capacity, longer battery life, and most importantly, the ability to listen to my Audible books without having to use another device. This is perfect whether I'm using it at home or while I am traveling."
JDI,5.0 out of 5 stars,I haven't charged this since the week of Thanksgiving and I still have 36% battery life. It's not a everyday use item for me (less than a hour daily) and I've listened to less than 10 minutes of audible with it so your mileage may vary but I am seriously impressed. It is ready to go when I want to read something and that means a lot to me personally coming from a kindle fire hd. Don't even bother with the HD.
Adam,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Can not read library books. An ebook reader, can not read books from the public library. Can't read epubs either. Forces you to get all your stuff from Amazon. Why would I want to spend $20 on an ebook that I can get from the library for free! Waste of time and money. Do research and make sure you don't get forced into buying stuff you can get for free elsewhere. At least Project Guttenberg works, until they block that too."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the new Paperwhite's size and the fact that you can read in bright sunlight - and it's waterproof (I haven't tested that!) It is different from my Kindle Fire Tablet, but it was easy to navigate from the start. I had a question about my Kindle Unlimited subscription, and the Customer Service dept. personnel were great! I recommend this to everyone,"
Bart SFCA,1.0 out of 5 stars,"You need wifi to make it work... duh? But it will download from a cable internet connection, so why can't it initialize itself from a cable internet connection? Sure, it's a ""wireless device"" but it does its basic stuff just fine from a cable connection. There must be a lot of people who'd like to buy a kindle but who don't have ready access to wifi. At least Amazon should make it VERY CLEAR that wifi is needed just to get it working although it is not needed to permit it to do what it's designed to do. ##"
F. S Virden,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This device is terrible, worse than original Kindle. Instructive print is too small top read. Touch screen is hard to actuate. Registration impossible , as normal credentials don't work. Instructions say one can talk to an associate to resolve issues. NOT SO. Cannot find a means to do this. I've wasted hours trying to get results, but no specific help available. THIS IS A BAD BUY."
Cormanang,3.0 out of 5 stars,This is my 5th Kindle and this by far is the worst. The time it takes to wake from sleeping is excessive. It’s battery life is way worse than my 8th generation Paperwhite. The built in light almost seems glarey. The touchscreen is not responsive if you want to change the % counter on the bottom of the page. I don’t know what they did with this version but I am underwhelmed. It makes me sad because Kindle is my favorite device.
R. E. Murray,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Kindle Paperwhite. Some of the touchscreen features of my previous one became ""sticky"" and would take 2-3 tries to get them to respond. This Paperwhite is lighter in weight. The screen is brighter and has better resolution. The cover that comes as an accessory is thinner and does not provide as much protection. Also it looks cheap compared to my previous Kindle cover. Battery life so far has been acceptable."
Dead Serious,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have several kindle products, and this one maintains the quality I've come to expect. It's waterproof, which is awesome, as I like to read in the tub and by the pool (although I haven't had to test it yet). The one complaint I have for all kindles, including this one, is that it is still difficult to highlight precisely, especially over consecutive pages. I highlight a lot, and it's incredibly frustrating when you have to start at the bottom of one page and go to the next."
Terri L Washburn,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used my old one for a lot of gaming activity, but memory was minimal and battery life was nothing to brag about. My son bought me the new paperwhite one for Christmas, including the magnetic cover and I love it. Unfortunately, about the 4th time I used it, the screen locked and I ended up having to go on line from my laptop and hunt down a solution on the internet - not that difficult as it seems to be a somewhat popular occurrence. The price for me was fantastic, I'm afraid to look up the actual price, but my son showed me how to work it. It is fast and efficient, holds a whopping amount of data, and has a superior battery life. I absolutely love it. the screen changes from dark to light for ease of reading in bed or outside. I can read it just like a book and the book-marking feature is really easy to use."
A,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have 3 of these for each of my kids. 2 are the previous version and 1 is the newest Waterproof one. All of them are excellent. The children have access to plenty of books, it's easily transportable, and they can't play games on them. We have them using FreeTime, but I think I have all the kids set up at like teenager or something, because the younger settings have books that seem pretty well below reading level."
arebeltexan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well my 3rd generation Kindle e-reader finally bit the dust unfortunately. I liked having the keyboard and the way to organize collections. However this one surprised me. It's all touch screen and I wasn't sure how I'd like it and yes I'm only 39 but still a little old fashioned... Other than the touch screen sensitivity for when I was putting my books back into collections I really have enjoyed this e-reader and I've read probably 6 books since getting it...
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not a good book reader and was always anti tech when it comes to book. To me, books were always about touching the paper, smelling the books. That's all there but sometimes you can't afford a bunch of books you want to read. But kindle makes it easier. Plus you save papers, as an environmentalist. I think it's great. You can read in while taking a hot bath not worrying about the water, or keep it in your backpack not worrying about the rain! I think that's a plus. Last but not the least... Being a bilingual person, sometimes I do not know the meaning of all the words .. before I used to keep my mobile with me and that was a lot of work to type in the words on google to understand the meaning.. where on kindle you can just tap on the word of your kindle book and it will tell you the meaning. I am very much satisfied with this purchase."
Mark,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My one complaint is that the Kindle Paperwhite's bluetooth connectivity to my headphones is buggy. Once I've connected my headphones if I disconnect and want to reconnect the headphones, you MUST turn the bluetooth off on the Kindle and then turn it back on. (Using the Kindle 5.12.1 Firmware) I'm able to reproduce this issue consistently.

This refresh act allows the Kindle to reconnect to headphones via bluetooth. For consumers who don't know to do this, simply attempting to connect to your headphones again will never work which I imagine would be pretty frustrating. For this reason, I had to drop my review to 4-stars.

Despite that issue, I'd say this is a good enough e-reader for me. It's relatively inexpensive yet feature-rich and I can load it with all the PDFs I'd ever want without having mountains of books taking up space. Not to mention the backlight is very useful too for night reading."
gsmatt,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle. My first one broke, due to my fault. The second I say, just became weary. I was ready for an upgrade. This one, I'm very disappointed. Not only do I believe there are no upgrades with this one, except the inflated price. It's very touchy. Losing my place in the book, is lost frequently. The library is not user friendly. I would recommend my 2nd one. I think it was the 3rd generation, although I'm not sure."
Jocy💗,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for my teen daughter, She loves it! I just don’t like that it doesn’t have color and the touch screen is slow. Other than those two things it’s great. It’s perfect in size, fits in a small purse and it’s waterproof."
Maurice G.Dion,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Between my I-phone and old Amazon reader, I had to have an E-reader under charge at all times or wait an hour or two to read. Now I have enough charge to read a complete book or two without a recharge. The size is right for my hand and the dim feature can save battery life during the daylight hours. I purchased a case which turns the reader off and on with the cover. I am very satisfied with the various fonts and spacing. It is an excellent purchase for the price."
Shirley G,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Kindle when they first came out and it was heavy and you couldn't see the screen in outdoor lighting. This new Kindle PaperWhite is smaller, lighter, the background lighting is perfect for nighttime and due to it being lightweight, it is easy to hold and read while in bed. The screen is also easy to read in the daylight while outdoors. I just love it and am reading more because of it."
Melissa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After a long struggle to decide to go fire or regular kindle, I'm so pleased I went with a regular kindle. Though it doesn't have color like I really would prefer, I like being able to just get to my books. I have read that technology is becoming available to have colored kindle screens for the future, but the guy at Best Buy said it would be silly for them to utilize it because it would cut into the fire market. I don't think so. I would like to buy a magazine on kindle, but I'm not going to do so in black and white!

For the moment, this is great and if they make a color option in the future, I can always trade this in and all my items will still be there! Yay!"
Sally Young,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Kindle keyboard for years that I was very happy with. But of course the battery was not replaceable so eventually I had to buy a new model. I thought this would be some kind of big improvement....but alas, no. First of all, even downloading a small file like a sample is hit or miss and often does not happen at all. There's a fix for that which involves a reset and then reloading ALL of your books and settings.....not the way I want to spend my time. Also, other dis-improvements involve the power button on the bottom so you have to be careful not to hit it by accident while reading. Sometime the screen is so responsive that it will turn pages when you are trying to highlight or if you just brush across it accidentally with your hand. And finally, the battery is not nearly as impressive as it sounds. I'd be so happy to have my old kindle keyboard back.....it had no problems other than planned obsolescence."
Grandma,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Most of us are familiar with Kindle. What I found out with newest Kindle Paperwhite is WiFi stays on all of the time, draining the battery. You need to shut off WiFi and then sign back into WiFi with your password when you need WiFi.
There is no availability for games, such as Solitaire, etc on this Kindle. Also of interest, if you buy the cover for this model and the Kindle is shut off, but then open the case cover-the Kindle turns on.
Certainly none are deal breakers but just an FYI.
Otherwise, I love the Paperwhite!"
Tina Larsson,2.0 out of 5 stars,I've had my kindle for 15 months. I loved it when I first got it. I have had kindles prior to this one which I also loved but I liked that this one was waterproof. Now I haven't used it in quite a while. The battery was dead no surprise there. So I go to charge it and nothing all its showing is the same symbol. I've been on the phone with Amazon kindle support for two days! Keep charging and doing hard resets. Nothing had helped but the window for warranty is closed but hey I can buy a new one for a100 dollars. No thank you why spend spend more money on a product that is clearly faulty. Super frustrated and disappointed .
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the paperwhite because the reader that I had could not convert to white writing on a black background. Although I was able to do it on the paperwhite, there was a little reflection that made the background subtly striped. It appeared to shimmer (because I am human and don't stay perfectly still) and it was very distracting. I was impressed that the battery lasted so long. When my current reader dies, I will be back to try one of your other models."
danni,3.0 out of 5 stars,"When I received this device I liked the fact that it was lighter in the hand and more comfortable to hold. However, upon turning it on and examining the device I noticed the lighting is terrible.. it lights from the bottom to the top and it is very uneven and I noticed a lot of shadows over some of the text. I can honestly say that the paperwhite I had prior to this device, the lighting was more even and less noticeable. I am not pleased with this new device and would love for them to fix this defect because otherwise the text is crisp and nice."
Franklin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lost my first gen Oasis and decided to go with this because the 6 inch screen was important to fit in my bag. Well made device. Bought a cloth cover and everything works great. Wish the power button was on top but that hasn't been the problem I expected.
JLH,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly? I just wanted the same old Kindle Paperwhite I already had, only one able to survive a quick water event. But no. They had to change all of the book access interfaces. It's all ""improved"" and ""upgraded,"" (yes, that was sarcasm) so that now I can't find a damned thing, and I'm spending waaay too much time fussing with it. It's seriously annoying. I've gone back to using my old one."
Kathi Linz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this Paperwhite because it holds many more books than the old one. I like that I am able to see all the books in my library without having to go on a PC to find the list. I like the clarity of the fonts and that itis very responsive to page changes and other screen commands. It is now my new default device. Everything I order goes to this device first. Thank you.
Steve Swanson,1.0 out of 5 stars,The listing sais that it has Wifi + Cellular. I ordered this to use in a location that has cellular bur not Wi-Fi. During the setup I discovered it only supports Wi-Fi. So now i will gave to pay for a hotspot and service for something that was supposed to be included. Disappointing.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it! Best thing ever! Works great, no problems, isn’t too bright when you turn it on. It is just as bright as your cell phone if you click it open and forget to turn down the brightness but it is only for a few seconds. I mean people don’t buy it to watch how it turns on for a few seconds they buy it so they can read all the amazing books you can download and read. ❤️ You can easily adjust how bright you want it when readying, make notes, highlight important works or quotes and much more. Great for trips and perfect screen size 😊"
mamaThea,4.0 out of 5 stars,"While I'm not super tech, I appreciate the lightness and size of my new Kindle. Navigating is not especially convenient, but over time I will adjust. Rather disappointed that my Solitaire game was no longer available on the new system... I really liked playing the game on the paperwhite as it was calming for my eyes & brain. Having full color games on other devices is overwhelming at times. If Oak Games would make another Solitaire collection for the paperwhite, I would be a happy person."
Kelly O.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had a Kindle DX for years. I wanted a Kindle that was a larger size. I finally broke down and bought the Kindle Paperwhite because I was able to pay with 5 (I believe it is 5) monthly payments. I love it! It is easy to carry in my purse and so I do. I take it everywhere and read a lot more now. The battery lasts a long time and the light adjusts which is awesome.
Thalia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband and I both recently traded in older Kindle models for the new Paperwhite. Personally I love the crisper, easier to read screen with backlighting and extra storage. Was disappointed that the 3G option was no longer available on the smaller storage options but I can still buy books via phone when not on WiFi. Was especially pleased that Amazon would take the older models in trade in and see they were disposed of safely."
pr1894,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Battery life poor (moderate reading requires twice weekly recharge, even in airplane mode). Perhaps this is because I've got my entire library (thousands of books) on it, but that shouldn't make a difference unless it is constantly rebuilding indices.

Lighting is decent, waterproof functionality superb, but page turning is sluggish (perhaps due to the aforementioned index build). Touchscreen selection/highlighting is a line off, always below my finger touch point.

This is my fifth or so e-ink kindle over the past ten years (I keep several around), not including several Fire devices. This one is the most sluggish of all, saving my very first one long ago."
Duke,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Paperwhite has a lot of great features. However, the long lasting battery advertisement is a hoax. If anything, the battery life is shorter than previous generations. I am deeply disappointed in regards to that aspect."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"While we were waiting to be seen by our Doctor, there was a woman sitting next to me and she had this really neat little gadget, I asked her what it was and she responded that it was a Kindle Paperwhite that she had been given as a present. So immediately I arrived home I looked on Amazon and purchased it, this is exactly what I was looking for as when we have appointments which are many I like to read and rarely do I find things I would be interested in reading when I am at physicians offices , and I had a much older Kindle that was to bulky to carry around, this Paperwhite is perfect for that purpose and it fits easily into a bag , it is easy to handle , you can read outside without being bothered by glare , in short it is perfect!!"
Meli,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I saw my brother using this device when he came over. He never used to like these e-readers, but he said that this was a fantastic one. It's so light and the battery life is very long. Prior to this I was using the kindle app on my phone, but my phone is pretty heavy and the screen is small. I would recommend this to everyone!"
J Lo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used the trade-in program. I got a $5 credit, but I couldn’t figure out how to get the 25% off I was supposed to get by using trade-in. So I bought the new paperwhite, but didn’t get any discount. Then to make matters worse, 2 or 3 weeks later the paperwhite went on sale! I feel robbed!"
Richard G. Maner,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product with 1 big flaw. The power button is placed so that if you rest device on table/chest etc or hold it with a finger on the bottom and it goes to sleep. I put mine to sleep several times per read. But, it is still a very nice device. I love kindle devices. I have 1 at home. 1 in my rv. 1 in my vehicle and another in my wife's car. I am never unable to read."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"In a word, not. I gave in to the invitation to trade my old Paperwhite in for a much more recent model. However, I ""didn't follow the instructions exactly"", and so wound up paying full price. Oh well, I thought, this new model will be much better. Nope: The ""new model"" is no faster than the old one, with the same sluggish response to screen presses that was irritating with my original model. Oh well, that's what I get for falling for seductive advertising."
Eric,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle died, screen stopped working. The trade in value was $5. So I took advantage of Prime day and got me a new Paperwhite model. It was the one I could afford so I did not read the specs but I did know it was waterproof. Great! I have not tested this other than sloshed coffee but it did not seem to harm it. It is smaller than I expected, but after having used it for a while It is just fine. I am very happy with it."
RBeau,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this little e-reader! After reading e-books on my phone for years, my eyes are so thankful that I finally went ahead and purchased a Kindle. I'm pleasently surprised that the text is crisp, clear, and easy on the eyes. The non-glare screen is so ""book like"" that you almost forget that you aren't reading the real thing. It's compact and easy to toss into my purse. Now I'm never without my book. I love it!"
Meredith M. Chase,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my new Paperwhite. Screen is easier on my eyes and the best part is a longer period between battery charging. Touch screen works well but can't see much difference. The size of the screen, overall size and weight are about the same."
John Vincent,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not nearly as useful or user friendly as I would have hoped. Quality of illustrations rendered (important when reviewing technical subject matter) is really poor, the touch screen lacks predictable responsiveness and the device doesn’t support scrolling - something that the FREE Kindle app for tablets does allow. While I was excited to get this as a gift, I find that I’ve gone back to using my tablet device and have the Paperwhite collecting dust on my desk."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my over a decade old Kindle for the new Paperwhite because my original Kindle's battery life was next to nothing. The new Paperwhite is same size as my original (which is a big plus for me) and being able to adjust the screen brightness makes it possible to read in different light conditions, perfect for plane trips when you don't want to turn on the overhead. The Paperwhite is touchscreen like all newer devices, not sure if the touchscreen functionality and reliability will be better than the buttons but only time will tell. My only disappointment was that the new Paperwhite only came in gloss black (at least at the Amazon pop-up store where I did my trade-in). But I did get $15 for my old unit and multiple discounts so I'm satisfied with upgrade. And having a Kindle while traveling is better than packing books/magazines/etc., at least for me. I could read on my laptop but I prefer the Kindle option."
Abvarn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My other Kindle is a Fire. The glare in sunlight was a problem and it was heavier. This kindle is light. The screen, while not truly ""paper white"" is clear, easy to adjust and easy on my eyes. Far better than reading from my Samsung S8+ at bedtime. The charge holds as advertised. I am very happy with this purchase."
Jason S Mulvey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older paperwhite that unfortunately died due to an issue with an update. While I'm not happy with the fact that I can't get a perfectly fine piece of hardware working due to a software hiccup, this replacement I bought is even better than my old one. The reduced weight and improved battery life are great. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the 10th gen paperwhite to someone looking for an ereader."
Alissa,2.0 out of 5 stars,I got my kindle at the beginning of the year and LOVED it. For the last month or so I had my Kindle in a drawer and hadn't' touched it. I pulled it out earlier today to start a new book and there were lines all over it! I tried restarting it but no luck!! Such a waste of money... barely had it for 5 months and it's already broken and I have no idea how.
Samantha Hedges,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love how adjustable the reading settings are. You can choose type of font, size, boldness. You can also choose the brightness on a sliding scale. I just changed over from a Nook. So far I am pleased with the differences. Love how the screen is not recessed to accumulate dust in the corners."
Anne,1.0 out of 5 stars,"No stars. An impossible new interface, which refreshes every few seconds makes this reading experience impossible. I have no idea if the lighting is better--each page throbs from white to black and then back to white--focusing on a word, let alone a paragraph or page-- simply cannot be done. There are so many ads and recommendations and pieces of superfluous information on the home page, as well, that speak to Amazon's need to sell you more stuff even after you have just purchased a book. That is not enough. So Amazon provides the book jackets for four other books Amazon thinks you would like. I would go back to Oasis but the new operating system seems to have taken that machine over as well. At least it doesn't throb. But I am heading back to an old Fire. It may be heavier but the user interface is a dream."
Alan C,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this primarily to check my recently published book in kindle format. This kindle is incredibly light, and the touch-feel is great. The lettering and images are very sharp. And the battery life is beyond impressive. I find the touch screen a bit clunky and/or slow - hard to say exactly but I feel it delays slightly in responding to a command. I do miss the ability to switch to the internet for a search on a topic - if it comes with that capability, I haven't found it. Otherwise, for long distance travel (think long flights or a week's vacation) this would be great as you wouldn't need yet another plug or cable for recharging."
Brandon C. Adams,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This device only worked for a few months. It stopped allowing books to be delivered to it. It's hard to tell, but you can see in the picture I posted that it is glitching as I try to deliver a book to it. I can see the book for a second, but it doesn't stay. Customer service couldn't help and only offered me %15 off of a new Kindle. I don't want to go through this again, and won't be buying another Kindle."
michael d. crocker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve only hade the new model for a few weeks, but I’ve enjoyed using it. It is a bit lighter and the flushed screen seems nice. The battery life seems to me to be much better. Once fully charged, I read an hour a night easily for week with no need to recharge. I have not tried the audio books out yet. I would recommend this if in the market for new e-reader."
H. Bashinski,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am mostly disappointed in this product, as it does not seem that different from my previous Kindle. I do not like the power button on the bottom, although I'm sure others didn't like it on the back. Battery life seems about the same. The experimental browser still doesn't work very well. I still like the Kindle for reading, but this device could be a LOT better designed."
barbara sims,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this because my Fire tablet would not hold a charge even one day. This is better than that, but navigating it is so cumbersome. I am not really happy with it either. I do like that I can read it easily, the lighting is good, but trying to download my books has been difficult for me. I'm used to more user friendly formats/tablets - maybe I'll be happier with it as I grow more accustomed to it. But right now, not as happy as I had hoped to be with the product."
Patricia Buchner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Although I do have the Fire tablet which is really nice, color, variety of uses; I love the Kindle Paperwhite. It is so lightweight, easy to carry, easy to fit into pocket, purse, etc. to pick up and read at total convenience. It powers up almost immediately, easy to read, and storage is amazing. I can't wait to read all the books I have already downloaded! I would have to say the the ease of use is the most fabulous feature!"
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My older Paperwhite kindle has a weak battery so I've decided to update and get this new version. I was really disappointed in this new version of the kindle. First of all, the glare is unacceptable. If its a little sunny outside, its impossible to read the book. You'll have to move around and tilt to make sure no light hits the kindle. My older version was much better at this and i was able to read at any setting. Second, all fingerprints remain visible on this kindle. Not sure if new type of plastic is being used, but this is definitely not an improvement. Sending mine back now and keeping my older version of the Paperwhite."
vrickg,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love how light it is; even more perfect for travel. Lighting is better than we last Kindle Fire. Size [about the same as a paperback] took a little time to get used to. I only didn't give 5 stars because, for some reason, I just don't find it very easy to navigate. Swiping down to get to home and my own library and other functions takes persistence; especially frustrating when reading and turning pages is so effortless."
B. Gravitt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had the first gen Paperwhite that I loved. Upgraded to latest and greatest. Very happy so far. Battery life is indeed longer. Took a bit to navigate new set up, but no worries, figured out with few problems. The lighting on screen has improved, much more even on screen. Hate the ads but not about to pay to get rid of. A small inconvenience. Every thing from old unit was there when I registered unit. A good all in all upgrade."
wanda j.ross,5.0 out of 5 stars,love it !
anthonyp,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After using this Kindle for a month, I find that the tiny amount of diminished size make my fingers on either side tend to barely touch the page and therefore it goes to the next page or back...I find this an annoyance and it takes away forty reading pleasure.....I can't imagine why Amazon did this, so be aware of it and possibly purchase an older model ...I also think the price to get one without advertisements would be a smart move.....Tony"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using Kindle readers and Fire products since they first were introduced. I have been a very loyal customer who has given Kindle products a thumbs up and have down played any other competitive product out there. However, I’m done. After buying 3 Kindle Fires and having all of them stop working/charging after a short period of time, I decided to go back to a Kindle reader since reading books is my passion and why I bought a Kindle in the first place. Well after not even 3 months of having my new generation Kindle e-reader that came with a 2 feet cord and NO charger, the cord no longer works and now I have a hard time finding any charger that works. I’m done! That was the last straw. I can no longer support a product that had so much promise become so disrespected by its manufactures that’s its become cheap and worthless. I have been reluctant to buy an iPad to do my reading on but that’s where I’m going. You get what you pay for and it’s tone to jump ship. I am extremely sad f disappointed but I can no longer throw away my money."
Ted,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Kindle Paperwhite lasted 7 years. My husband's is still going strong. I used our Prime account to get a fast replacement. The Generation 10 Paperwhite will take only a little getting used to as the menu options are displayed a little differently. The touch screen seems to be more sensitive to my touch, but I need to learn how best to ""touch"" it. I can't report on the battery life as I just put this in service yesterday after I received it. I'm not sure how yet, but I think I can download an audio book from the local library and listen to it through Blutooth headphones. I look forward to trying that feature out."
Rosemary Ruark,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually don’t write reviews but for this waterproof kindle I had to. Over the past holiday I was visiting relatives and somehow my kindle (it was in a cover, but just an ordinary holder) was put into the washer, yes the washing machine. When I took out the laundry and found my kindle among the towels I was sick, it was almost brand new and I figured it was ruined, but to my relief, it was not ruined but worked fine. I still was not convinced it would be okay....but...its been 3 weeks and still works great. So a kindle I bought for using at the pool ended up going through a washing machine and survived!!"
WesSide7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything is as advertised. It’s sleek, water proof, easy to hold and read & the back light doesn’t keep my wife up at night when I want to read late into the night.

The battery is as advertised as well but you have to put it in airplane mode. It seems like a hassle to do this but your Kindle is not like your phone where you need it active for all your texts, calls and notifications. Put it in airplane mode and you’ll get weeks out of the battery.

I love my Kindle and I am extremely happy with it. I highly recommend getting the Amazon case made for it over all others. This device is the best companion for the voracious reader!!!"
v-d@wg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first e-reader device. I decided to purchase one after getting tired of lugging books on international trips, or wishing that I had reading material when I had left it at home. I've only had it for a week, and have finished one book and starting another. I love that I can adjust the light settings and read in the dark. It's also great that I can borrow e-books from the local library and send it to my Kindle. This fits all of my reading needs, but due to the ""e-ink"", I wouldn't recommend this for reading illustration-heavy books such as comics.

I haven't tested to see if the device is waterproof, or used the audiobook capability yet, but those are just added bonuses for me."
GT,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I give this one star rating for one reason , and one reason only. The monumentally stupid decision to put the power button on the bottom of the device. I took my Kindle paperwhite with me to eat lunch today. In the 30 minutes I was eating and reading, I had 6 inadvertent shut downs. I have also had the thing shut down while sitting on the couch or laying by the pool. It is just far too easy for the power button to be accidentally pushed when you rest it on a table, armrest, your stomach, knee, or wherever you might set it. I think the button may also be more sensitive, as I did not have this problem with my old kindle paperwhite (1st gen).
If the power button was on the top, side or protected somehow, I would give it four stars.
Also I wish I had spent the extra money and gotten the cellular version. I travel for work, and to constantly have to connect to other wifi (especially with logon screens) is kind of a pain."
DJD,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The on/off button is located on the bottom or the devise and I keep accidentally turning it off. My wife has an older version and the button is close to the top and works better. I don't like when the device starts up it opens with an advertisement page. After reading from an iPad, the technology seems very out of date, plus I really miss a color, high resolution screen. Having said that the price is right compared to an ipad and the smaller size is very handy. It also holds a charge well."
Mmusso,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift from my son as I am always reading. I like it, but navigation is a little slow and a little difficult to navigate, I also have an iPad that I use the Kindle app on and it is much more responsive and easier to navigate. I like the size and the weight, as my Ipad is a lot heavier, but as I said the touch screen and navigation is sluggish. All in all its a great size for travel and work."
Duke Redtree,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My fingers are stubby. The Paperwhite has tiny control areas on the screen. Getting what I want is a matter of time and luck. HOWEVER, I like the ability to download books quickly. ON THE OTHER HAND, I think the instructions are not clear. I LIKE the fact that I recharge the battery every 10 or 15 days instead of 2 or 3 times a day. OVERALL, the kindle is a better book reader than my smart phone. Maybe I'll get more excited about it as time goes on?"
ckellymi,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My original review is left intact below. the same day that I wrote the review amazon's tech support called and walked me through the nuances of using my new paperwhite reader. The information was very helpful and made using the new Paper White much easier. Original review ""the new paper white is too wide for my hand and has marginal touch screen performance. The software doesn't allow me to page back and forth in the books I'm reading""
my original disappointments were resolved by the Amazon technician"
JoEri,1.0 out of 5 stars,I received my new Kindle Paperwhite earlier than the agent thought it would come. He assured me that this one would have a usb cable that would fit and work. Well--he was mistaken. A day or 2 later I received an email indicating that some customers were encountering this ongoing problem. I clicked on the link and the site indicated that the cable was not now available and probably would NOT be available. Tell me how I am to charge my new Kindle and start reading on it.
Cathy Hill,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very excited to get this Kindle as it was supposed to be waterproof and I love reading by the pool, in the pool, or on the beach. I got it in November so this past weekend was the first time I had tried it out while in the sunshine. Very quickly, I got a message that it was overheating and needed to cool down or it would shut off. I have had 2 previous Kindles and none of them ever had a problem being used outside while sitting by the pool, or on a beach and I've taken them to the tropics where it is much hotter. I made sure the light was turned off also so as to not create anymore heat. This will be useless to me if I can't read it outside while I am on the beach or in the pool. Glad I still have my other Kindles."
Pattie,5.0 out of 5 stars,New to the small Paperwhite! I have a Kindle Fire that I love but since I can’t use it all the time when I want to read outside I decided to get the Paperwhite. ( actually got it as a gift after I planted hints). I’m not a tech person at all and I wish I had an instruction sheet rather than reading info on the Paperwhite. Like how do you turn it on and off?! Basically I figured it out but it took a while! Font is good size wise and the print is dark enough! The Paperwhite is very light which is nice. I also like the case!
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sitting in a stand for easy reading the kindle rests it's weight on it's power button and touching the screen is often enough to trigger the power button and turn the kindle off.

Likewise the plug for power in on the bottom so if you have it in a stand you can't have it plugged in and charging.

This could have easily been fixed by allowing 180 degree rotation instead of only 90 degrees.

I would have given it four stars with that except I also checked online and it became clear that customers have asked for this and the ability to rotate the kindle in the other direction as well and have been ignored.

It's the failure to recognize and meet customer needs that merits the one star rating."
Shari,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth Kindle and my least favorite. Why? It's slow to open, slow to respond to touch, the light is annoyingly bright when opening, then it settles down once opened to your preferred seeing. The only thing good I have to say about it is that it feels lighter. Wish I'd never bought it. In fact, I'm using my old one with screen scratches more than I use this new one."
Casey Marlow,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love it! I was late to the ereader party, but I’m so glad I joined. I considered the Oasis for the larger screen, but this size works perfectly well for me. It is so light that I sometimes feel for it in my bag just make sure it’s there. There are also several ways to read for free through the Kindle lending library, Prime reading, and connecting to your local library’s ebook catalog. It offers some neat features like a “time left in chapter” measure and dark mode.

My only critique is that there is some faint ghosting while on the store. I had never seen this while reading or in my library. It is not visible enough to bother me, especially since it does not show in the book."
Sue G.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got the Kindle because our library is closed due to Covid-19, I may never go to the library again. The Kindle is easy to use, I can read anywhere, in a dark room, even in sunlight. The screen is a little touchy, you've got to keep your fingers away from it, and the border isn't large. I've been charging it every other day, the battery doesn't last weeks as advertised, not when you're using it, anyhow. My biggest complaint is it arrived in a squished box with absolutely no packing material around it, I'm surprised it survived. I've also not been able to get the cover off of it since I applied it."
Samantha,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It is lightweight and the perfect size for an e-reader - bigger than my phone, smaller than a tablet. I used to read on my phone. It is super disappointing that the book covers are in black and white, though - they are difficult to read this way."
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Liked the previous kindle better. Bought so I could read when floating in the pool or in tub without worrying.
Another Amazon Shopper,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Power button placement, sensitivity, and the fact that it sticks out means you will unwantedly power off your device. UI is cluttered with books you don't even own, not intuitive, not helpful in finding or filtering for free books, and not that helpful in sorting and filtering books you do own. It's great when you are actually reading the thing you want to read at that moment, but otherwise it's a mess."
James Moore,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I bought this Kindle, I also bought one of the covers that turns it on and off when you open and close it. Now whenever I touch the Kindle anywhere, it turns the page. Not sure which to blame, but it's really bothersome. Other than that, the screen is outstanding. This is the only version that works on a cruise ship, which is why I use it. It is phenomenal for that. And the waterproof utility really helps the Kindle survive in that type of environment."
W. Wirtanen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to order the paperwhite when my old one died. Everything works great. My only problem is not with the paperwhite itself, but being able to transfer the content that is on one device to the new one. I have looked but haven't found if there is a method to do this. The one feature that is nice is that those books read are marked. Overall very happy with it."
Bill Bunkum,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite is great, thus I'll give 'er 3 stars, however there are a few issues that make it annoying – cause me to second-guess buying the thing in the first place. Firstly, there are loads of books that simply don't exist for Kindle. The idea of a Kindle is to simplify, not to add yet another tool/device to update and cart around. Secondly, some of the 'Kindle' books for download are 'not compatible' with this newest, most up-to-date Kindle Paperwhite. Again, unfortunate. I don't want to read off of a phone, that's why I bought a Kindle.... Thirdly, .docs and such work fine on the Kindle APP but don't show up (or sometimes do randomly?) on the Kindle itself. I hate the 'sync' button. It's your only agency when something doesn't work, and when that happens, It. Doesn't. Sync. Again...annoying. This technology isn't new – I feel that there should be more homogeneity/support within these products so that the user isn't constantly made to bear the load for compatibility. After all, how do you upgrade a Kindle? You don't."
Steve,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just love this library, and when ever i like to read, i use kindle as my first choice. its very light weight, no glare, has the book feeling. and it fits in my shirt pocket. i simply take it with me when ever i am expecting to be sitting or waiting for something like clinic or barbershop or just chilling at coffee place. i dont want to cary my Ipad with me all the time, its havy and glarring and canot fit it in my pocket!."
Linda S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had it for going on 3 weeks, and am reading up a storm. I like having access to so many free reads through Kindle Unlimited. The font size is adjustable for easy reading. The built in light makes reading easy while relaxing in bed or sitting in subdued lighting. It's user friendly. I was quickly able to learn how to use the features to download and return books. It's heaven on earth for avid readers. I'm glad I bought it."
Jamie Orban,2.0 out of 5 stars,I've owned kindle products for the last 10 years and upgraded to the all new paperwhite in December so I could take my book with me to the pool and beach this upcoming summer. I'm five months into using the product and it will not charge past 50% and I only get to 50% if I'm watching it and keep turning the device screen on. I'm starting to see similar reviews on here and it doesn't look like anyone has received a response from amazon
T. Stofer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought the size of the screen would matter more, but it has not. Once you get started reading (as you do with any book), everything else slips away. After reading a bit with it, I wondered if there is a similar type of screen (non-reflective) for viewing and reading text that has color, and other media. In the past I purchased books on software, and even books on drawing and multi-media techniques that would be nice to have in one place. I can see myself using this a lot. Happy with my purchase."
Books4litsouls,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because it was on sale and wanted no distractions while readying, so far I'm reading on this more than my fire but maybe because I just got it and I'm excited. I feel like it's not worth the original price and glad I got it on sale and I was also disappointed that the audiobook only works with bluetooth! Thank God I have my fire with speakers anyway I am content so far and will update in the future"
Regan limuti,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I just updated to this Kindle Paperwhite after having the previous one, screen shattered, so went and bought the new one. This one is just as good, however, the power button changed from the back of the kindle to the bottom. Before, I never even knew it was there, since I never turn off. Now, when I read, I am constantly hitting the power button, and its trying to turn off!! What was the point of moving? The cover doesn't cover it."
PrinterCPE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a Kindle for over a decade. This is my third version. I gave one away and someone drove over another. This is the best. Smaller, lighter, touchscreen, built-in light, better resolution - all improvements I appreciate. I know some folks who prefer a paper book. I prefer a tiny, light device with access to millions of books. And it is truly a pocket book."
fussyshopper,3.0 out of 5 stars,It allows me to read in bright light and is light weight. The touch screen is not smooth and several attempts are needed to bring the toolbar. Navigation is clunky and ads are in the way. It does what I bought it for but and glad I got during prime days. The technology is not new and I miss not being able to do other things. However I can read outside and for me that's important.
kf,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you intend to carry a Kindle anywhere it needs a cover for protection. I haven't had a new Kindle for some time and first of all this 10th generation Kindle is a pleasure. And the cover is a welcome addition. When you open the cover the book automatically comes to life and tells you when it's time to ""swipe"" to start, or open, the Kindle. And thankfully it is water-resistant because I dropped it in a puddle when getting into my vehicle today and there was no problem. Thankfully the Kindle started right up. It's a keeper as is the Kindle itself. I am enjoying both!"
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I use it to read books. This is my 6th kindle and the worse. The light is not good enough for me to read. It won’t fit the tablet cover I ordered with it. I can’t get to my books that have always been loaded on my previously purchased kindles. I am very, very disappointed and will now be forced to purchase a different tablet consistent with the products I have purchased from Amazon in the past."
Kostik,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I get it, it will show me ads that is why it is 20$ cheaper, but if it is off (meaning i am not reading or looking at it) why cant it turn off the screen. So if the screensaver is on it will drain your battery in one day. You can turn the screen off but it takes more effort as it is not default... FIX IT Amazon, you can do it with software update, not hard and get 5 stars from me"
Z.F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I traded in my previous kindle for the latest kindle paper-white on Prime day. It has been a great buy for me! The built-in light is fantastic for some light reading on bed to help me sleep. The waterproof feature makes it possible to read in the swimming pool. The new flat design is really elegant and classic. The storage is good for me. The processor makes it really fast for turning pages or searching for dictionaries. Overall it's great!
Brandi Chaudoin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my Kindle for exactly one week and LOVE it. It was easy to initially set up and update. It is very lightweight and sleek. The screen is amazing and exactly what I was looking for. I also have a Kindle Fire HD 8, but wanted something smaller and easier on the eyes for reading only. The Paperwhite has exceeded my expectations as far as battery life goes. I’ve only charged it on the first day and it still has 53% remaining - and that’s after daily use. I would recommend getting a case for it if you plan on taking it places. I got the amazon fabric case in canary yellow and I love it."
C.C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Like my kindle reader paper white because is small and light. It has ight to allow me to read at night no glare. You can turn pages like a real book. It's different from the other paper white I had before. I don t like the Bluetooth to hear my audio I preferred regular plug in ear phones recommend if you like changes..
MeleLovesShoes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the bigger flat screen, and the extra storage space. The charger connection was tight, unlike previous versions I have had. The extra storage space (32 gig) was worth the price for the upgrade. It seems to be holding a charge very well. I’ve been on vacation and haven’t had to recharge it in over a week so far. I have been in airplane mode and reading a lot, like 1 hour a day, and it’s still at 85%."
Joey,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love paper white... There is a lot of great to say about this. my only qualm with Kindle is not a specific device but rather the ""time left to read"" feature. It constantly is wrong, I am surprised this continues to happen. I have to reset it so frequently, and doing that is such an inconvenience by typing "";ReadingTimeReset. Why isnt that just a button to reset time? So I just want to offer some suggestions, and I am not even sure amazon will read this, but I could not figure out how to provide basic feedback to the Kindle team. PLEASE CONSIDER THESE OPTIONS:

-Page turns left in chapter/book
-a more obvious way to reset reading time. You have to be savvy enough to know how to type in ;ReadTimeReset. Just make it a button.

Thanks all I wanted to get off my chest."
Joseph C. Ellis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve postponed and postponed getting a new kindle. I had the Kindle Fire - one of the first ones out. I loved the back light because I do a lot of reading at night. I rarely used the tablet part of the Fire. For those rare times I read out doors, I hated the glare on the Fire, so I read outside less and less. So after weighing pros and cons, I decided I didn’t need the tablet, and ordered the Paperwhite. Oh my, I should not have waited so long. Back lit for night and no glare in sunlight. I didn’t realize it was back lit! I absolutely love it!"
Michael,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not very user friendly. Should be more intuitive. Couldn't download library books using the ""Overdrive"" app. that is usable with our Nook. We couldn't get the contrast adjusted, which made things difficult to read in certain lighting conditions. The user manual seems to be written for those already using the Kindle, rather than for those of us who are new to the device. Not a good experience."
Dolly Girl,4.0 out of 5 stars,"In general, I like this Paperwhite a lot better than the earlier one. It's more lightweight. It's easier to reach Goodreads. The audio is a nice addition, too.

I am disappointed in the backlight. I have to adjust it almost all the way up to be able to be able to see it well. On the older Paperwhite, my adjustment is only to half for the same brightness.

Because this seems to be hardware related, I dont that this can be fixed in an update."
Mike,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After purchasing my kindle paper white and excited to finally be able to use it, my amazon account was suspended simply because I changed the name on the kindle as it was a gift for someone. I can no longer use my kindle that I just purchased. Please avoid buying this item unless you want to spend money and not even be able to use your purchase."
Jean V. Murphy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very happy with my early-version Paperwhite, but unfortunately I lost it in an airport when changing planes. Mistook my carry-on's sleeve for an outside pocket. Anyway, as soon as I got home I ordered a new Paperwhite and it came with my library already populated, ready to go. Light, touch screen and battery life are all improved over prior version. Wouldn't be without it!"
R. Bodenstedt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to this device from a basic Kindle (8th generation) and I'm really glad I did. The touch controls are very responsive and the battery life is noticeably longer than in previous Kindles. The weight and size are great and the adjustable backlight makes reading much easier than on a basic Kindle. I really can't think of any negatives, it's a great device."
goblueinga,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The newest Paperwhite is buggy as all get out. The battery life is significantly worse than previous models, and it freezes up constantly."
Bunny Lumpkin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I took advantage of the return your old can know for $25 credit. I sent it back and with the label that they supplied with air bubble packaging. They refuse to give me my $25 credit saying that my Kindle screen is cracked. It was in perfect shape, the battery just wasn't holding a charge. So I suggest keeping your old Kindle and just buying another one and having a spare."
ed keah,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unbeknownst to me, I guess through my own ignorance, I have discovered my Kindle can't access the books that I have aquired from Barnes and Noble via my Nook! Bummer!"
J. Sylvestre,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the smooth screen so hairs to get caught.
But....
The text is often a lighter grey. Pushing down on the screen sometimes fixes this, so it appears to be a physical thing.
The Sync does not work. It says checking for new items, then nothing. If I leave it connected to wifi, it eventually downloads the new book. But the sync does nothing.
And it doesn't go as dim as my previous paperwhite on the lowest light setting."
Jim Dawson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is a replacement for my original Kindle, which died (screen would only partially work) after many years of use. It is all I expected, but the touch screen is overly sensitive on the left side and will unexpectedly page back when I hold it with my left hand and my thumb gets too close. I can choose to disable the touch screen, but then I can't use any other features until I reactivate the screen by turning the power off, then on. Too bad we can't control the size of each touch area or make the screen a bit less sensitive."
KC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded my old one in for the new one as the new one is now waterproof and I thought that will make it nice for around the pool this summer, this one is lighter than my old one, but I do love being able to read outside with it, yes you can see the screen outside, and since its backlit you can read at night also and it doesn't keep my husband awake at night lol. I love it so easy to use!"
HappilyEverAfter,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really bummed when my last (and first) paper white decided to die on me! Without good reason I might add! However I decided to purchase another and I am glad I did. This new model is great and it feels like an upgrade! It is quicker to turn pages and browse books in Amazon. The waterproof element seems nice, but I'll never be brace enough to test it out. ;)"
cedwards,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can you say about Kindle but they are the best. I worried because there were many negative reviews about pixels missing or whatever. I can’t comment as I never used the light, on any of mine. I love my kindle, this is number 4. None have worn out yet, just going for water resistance. The original keyboard one I gave to someone, who upgraded to a paperwhite and passed it along to someone else."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the Kindle Paperwhite devices but there really isnt anything exceptionally better about the new generation. The waterproof part doesnt really feel necessary and the nice blue backing is hidden in the protective case. It still works good but doesnt feel or work any better/worse than the one I traded in - doesn't feel like an upgrade. Next time I will research more before I upgrade.

Additionally, I will never trade-in another device again with Amazon. Despite all the protective packaging my old one was shipped back in, a protective kindle case, bubble wrap and a sealed box with extra stuffing....... I am being told it arrived non-operational. When I replied that it was turned off by me personally when I shipped it (fully charged battery) then all of a sudden it arrived with the screen cracked too. Based on reviews I read you will not be given more than $5 for your old one."
RickPat,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We traded in a year-old Kindle because the battery needed very frequent charging, and once on, the unit could not be powered off. Amazon generously offered to take the old Kindle in trade for a brand new Kindle, for an additional charge of $75. The new Kindle shipped very fast; in fact, we got it before sending the old one back. The new Kindle arrived with a battery charge of about 50%. I charged it up to 100%, but it steadily lost its charge over several days of use. After using it for less than a week, it would not power on. I plugged it into the USB port to charge, and it took several minutes before the dead battery icon appeared. Meaning the battery was totally dead. It's both amazing and very frustrating that Kindle apparently can't design a long-life battery that will hold a charge."
ML,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just seems like a outdated POS. Seriously, laggy AF, navigating it feels like using Netscape 20 years ago as everything is super slow to load and then finally I’m not even sure how long I have to wait after spending 25 bucks on a book. I downloaded a sample to my iPhone which was auto synced to the kindle, nice but I now bought the book 20 min ago and instead of just replacing the sample I still have a sample of the book but not the purchase version. sync button Apparently is worthless.

Just curious how big is the car the product team carpools in. I’m specifically interested in how many clowns they fit in that thing!

I would be embarrassed if this was my responsibility."
Krista Olson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the size and weight of the paper white. The protection from water is a reassuring feature, I’ve spent a few hours reading floating on the river on aa air mattress. There are a couple of things I did not like though. The battery life is not that great if you are an avid reader, although it does seem to charge quickly. Another dislike is that the page does not rotate and the charging port is on the bottom. It would be more comfortable if it would rotate so you could read and charge."
Kelli B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is the first Kindle I have purchased. Within 24 hours of use it broke. Amazon made it right by sending a replacement immediately and now that I have a working Kindle I can say I'm impressed. I read a LOT of books and this is so much easier on my eyes than my phone or the computer. The bonus of being able to read in the dark was unexpected and the reason I give that 4 stars is because I was hoping this would prevent me from reading all night long! The main drawback to the Kindle of course are library books. My library uses the 3M Cloud library which is incompatible with Kindle so I had to find another library that still uses Overdrive. Make this device more compatible with libraries and you'll have a bigger audience. I do recommend getting a case for holding the Kindle as the outer shell is slippery (IMHO) and a case makes sure it won't slip and fall out of my hand as easily.
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I do like my Kindle paperwhite. My previous Kindle (Keyboard) just quit working so I had to purchase something else. The Paperwhite was on special so I bought it. It took some time to get used to using it, and I wish I had bought it without the Special Offers, because so far none of the Special Offers seems to be anything I would buy, or take if they gave it to me.
It is light in weight and easy to carry, so I do like that."
Miguel Carranza,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was reading some physical books before I bought it, but since I prefer to read in the night, I found it a lot more convenient to read them on my kindle instead, since it's a lot easier to read with the built in light, besides being able to change the size of the font makes it so that you can have the text as big as you prefer, something that is almost never the case with physical books. Now, the pdf experience is awful and should be avoided if possible, if you want to read pdfs then this is the wrong device. The kindle is designed to read e-books formats with customizable text structure, which is something pdfs lack, in fact, pdfs work as a big resolution image, you cannot easily move from one part of the page to another. Being able to read pdfs is a feature, but it's definitely not enjoyable."
Brandon Michael Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing replacement to my wife’s old kindle paper white.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an original Kindle from many moons ago. Then I started reading my books on my 10' Tablet but that was too heavy to travel with. This Paperwhite is smaller than I expected but it fits in my purse and I can take it anywhere. I love it. Amazon has made it easy to buy books directly from the store.
Haven't tried it outside yet but after reading reviews I'm sure I will be happy with it."
Fitz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a Kindle, I do a lot of reading with it! Smaller than my last one that just stopped working after 5 years. Not happy that I can not read my magazines and then pull up them up with the m computer to see pictures in color on Kindle Reader.

Add one month later! Amazon if you are reading these, I loved my first two Kindles, I wore them out! This third one I am NOT impressed. I am a retired manufacturing guy. I am all for making things better, but this one is smaller and worse! I want my old Kindle! I am not get a 4th unless I see drastic improvement. Changed my rating from 4 stars to 1."
Juanpi,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd kindle since they released the first edition and they have not change much. Amazon will push you to subscribe to different programs in order to charge you for something. ""read for free"" subscription will cost you $9.99. My Kindle was capable to reproduce audio books but audible also charge you a monthly subscription of $14. Very few free books and the few free books are so old!!"
K. Sullivan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The text is not sharp. When turning pages a black background flashes with every flip, yet there is no black screen reading option. Not happy with this product. I mostly read on my phone. It's sharper."
Michele,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So it took a little bit to adjust to the touch screen. I think I like the buttons to turn the page better. I wish there was a way to make it less sensitive or for me to have to swipe to turn the page versus just touching the screen. The battery life doesn't provide the 2 to 3 weeks that I thought it would based on what I read before I purchased it. Other than that, I think the light on the background as fantastic and while I haven't tested it yet I do love the idea that it's waterproof. One of my favorite things to do in the evening when I get home from work is to relax in my bath tub, complain a little to my husband that it's not a jacuzzi, and read my kindle!"
Paul Scherf,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A lot of the features seem to be pretty close to the same as my old generation 7. I like to read in the pool, so a waterproof kindle will be easier to use than sealing my Kindle every time I read in the pool. I like the Bluetooth. I was never close to running out of storage with my old Kindle, so I may not notice any difference having the larger storage. My wife volunteered to take my old generation 7 as a hand-me-down, so it definitely isn't going to waste."
Franny,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got this for Christmas and was very excited as my Kindle Fire was on the verge of dying. I like the size and the light weight. It is kind of hard to hold because it is so small and thin and it felt slippery. I ordered a cover for it right away and it made a big difference. The cover I ordered is so cute. I almost like the cover more than the Kindle! ☺️ I have not had the opportunity to use it in the sun so I’m not sure how that works at this time. In general I am very happy with it.
Jason Morales,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from the original paperwhite and wow is it a huge difference. This one is much more responsive and the light is more even. It's much lighter than the one I had which is nice. I'm very satisfied with this product.

If you already have a newer kindle you probably won't need this one, but if you are upgrading from a much older model like I did then it's worth every penny."
Joe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is great, I've had it for a month, and after using it for 8 hours nonstop, its still at 50%. It took a while to get better battery though - turn off Bluetooth otherwise it seems to drain quickly."
Eric N,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, this device works great. Battery life is wonderful, weight is feather-light, background lighting is even and nice. My biggest issue with this device is they chose a completely idiotic place for the on/off button! I keep knocking the button when I switch hands, which powers it off. Super annoying! Did anyone test this when they designed it? The best device so far was the Voyager. The power button was recessed, perfect design. Amazon, go back to that with this hardware rev, and you have the perfect device."
Lindy@ A Bookish Escape,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my paper white. It’s light weight, easy and comfortable to hold, water-prof, and holds a charge. I love how it’s convenient and easy to store in my purse. The only suggestion that I would make is that I wish it had the blue reading technology like the a kindle Fire’s have that way there wouldn’t be a glare and it would be easier to read. Also, I wish we could delete books directly off of the Kindle instead of having to do it on the computer or phone."
David,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the perfect ereader if, like me, you like reading before bed or in the car. The light can be adjusted to be comfortable in any setting and it's so nice to not need a light on or to have to stop reading while going under a tunnel. I charged my Kindle two weeks ago and put it on airplane mode and it's at 56% with consistently 4+ hours of reading with the light on each day. Couldn't recommend enough!"
Rcollins,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Got the new kindle for Christmas. Wanted it because of the waterproof and the audible. I had my previous kindle paper white for years and loved it. Again, only reason I wanted upgrade was mainly for audible & water proof. My old paper white stayed charged for a couple days. You need to understand I read every day, for many hours per day. At least 6 to 8 hours. This kindle will not stay charged for more than 3 to 4 hours, even with WiFi & blue tooth off. And if using audible, it drains the battery. Again, was looking forward to using on the beach, now not sure how long battery will last. Unless you are definitely looking for audible,( which you will need to purchase Bluetooth headset for separately), save some money and buy the less expensive paper white. Weight is also no different, if that is an question in your decision."
OneFatDeny,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My new paper white is not much different than my older Paperwhite. Water proof? don't plan to submerge it or take it in the shower. More Gig's well old one held whole lot of books that I would never read anyway. And worse of all does not fit my old Kindle's case, have to buy new case now."
Paxsoga,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After many dependable years of service it was time to replace my old kindle paperwhite. The new model i received is everything the old one was for about the same price, plus bluetooth, waterproof, and Audible support to boot. A nice product that's exactly what it needs to be and nothing more."
person of questionable origin,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought three of them for the family. Terrible latency on all three. Tap a button,.. wait a minute... tap another button... wait another minute, etc., etc., etc. Navigation is bad, bad, bad. Other than that, it's light and easy to read. Come on guys, you gotta fix the latent navigation and non-existent search. Hard to find your books, unless you want to spend 20 minutes paging through looking for book."
Easy Rider,5.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed that the cover from my old paper white did not fit the new one. No need for that.
Chris Aram,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've purchased 500+ Kindle Books in the past four years and have gotten a lot of mileage out of my previous-generation Paperwhite. The newest model is actually exactly the upgrade I was hoping for: it's faster and more responsive (the old one felt sluggish at times) but retains the overall legibility (love the backlit e-ink; easy to read day or night) and ease of use. My one and only gripe (and it's minor) is that I wish the screen were a bit larger.
Kyra R. Zorn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never expected to love reading on a kindle; I thought I'd miss the weight of the book, holding it, and hearing each page turn. While I do miss hearing the page turn I don't miss the weights of books and the lugging 10 on vacation. It's slim, small, light, and makes getting books and having access to many books easy. The light feature makes it great for reading anywhere anytime and ease of adjustment is great. Battery life on the paperwhite remains excellent.

The current one has a wake up and swipe feature which I do not believe were in prior versions. I used to have push in the small button at the bottom which I did not like and did not work well.

I wish the screens were more scratch resistant."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only had it for about a month, but I'm quite pleased. I've only charged it once so far. The screen has been easy to read in bright light or in the dark. The form is thin and comfortable to hold, and the screen is more responsive than my first get, though not as good as my Kindle HDX. I am pleased that it plays Audible books, though I wish it had an earphone jack in addition to Bluetooth."
kp,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product! Great battery life! Love reading on it! Love the option to connect to (or filter out audible). I have hundreds of audio books, love that I can listen on that but don't have to sort through them while looking for my actual books :)
The back lighting is very intuitive, subtle and doesn't hurt my eyes while reading. Mat finish and no back lighting in light so very easy on the eyes."
Timbo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great display and battery life. Even after using the device for a ten hour period, the battery only dimished by 20%. I've been a Kindle Fire user since the beginning of the product launch and have owned several models and this is the first Kindle I owned and needed it for work purposes. Since I have owned the this Kindle, I have only used the Kindle Fire for apps and some books I have purchased where color content is critical such as Adobe Photoshop books"
Tyler Moore,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the kindle paperwhite (32GB, WiFi, no special offers) with the full intention of loading tons of manga on it. Not only is it incredibly easy to do, but the screen is also very sharp and very comfortable for me to read. In daylight the screen looks great, and at night time it’s perfect for winding down. Not only has the kindle allowed me to read all the manga I can handle, but it’s also really motivating me to read more dark fantasy novels such as authors like Neil Gaiman. I feel like I already knew I was going to love this device before I bought it, and I was so right."
Justyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I admit it took me a while to get around to buying one. I value the feel of books and have a small library at home, but they are a huge hassle to bring around since I constantly travel. The Kindle saved a lot of storage space and allowed me to bring more than just one book every trip. It's touch screen isn't the fastest and the battery life isn't as long as advertised. Overall, I am satisfied with this product"
Eileen,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am so happy I traded in my 5 year old Kindle Paper White for the new Kindle Paper White. I didn't want to do it through the mail so I went to the Amazon store in my area. It was so easy. The Customer service person was friendly and knowledgeable. She set every thing up for me and showed me the new features and I didn't have to spend even 5 minutes without my Kindle. I also got a fantastic discount on the package.
auntiep,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this kindle, and paired with Amazon prime I get lots of books to read for free. My son got this for me and it is so much lighter than my Nook. I recommend getting a case for it, (there are tons of great ones on Ebay). I just love this, it is easy to use and has great battery life, (I have not charged it in a least a week and it is still going), and the screen is wonderful and easy on the eyes. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to read, and especially if you travel or are on the go a lot, you can bring all your books with you!"
Something witty this way comes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this! It was discounted for Black Friday and Amazon offered me one of those monthly payment options without interest. I like that I can read it in the bathtub. I also found an article online on how to turn on Voice View. You connect a Bluetooth headset to the kindle, turn on Voice View in the accessibility menu and then the Kindle reads the book to you!"
Julie,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it but no head phone jack wth! I cant believe they include audible - which I absolutely love but no headphone jack. Yes I can use bluetooth but am sol if they die. Come on amazon. How hard is it to put a headphone jack. I mean I paid a pretty penny on this!
Also it wont even show me what's included free on my audible package I pay extra for every month...
I would have gave 5 stars if they included these two things..."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"screen changes from white to black every time you touch the screen! choppy/slow response.
what a bogus product. probably cheaply made and defective. but Amazon refused to take it back!
Customer support says: ""have gone through the issue and found out that it is normal behavior for this device, every time when you scroll page, there will be white-black flash"" ! wow Az!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kindle Paperwhite is just the right reading tool for home and travel. Reading at the beach is as comfortable as reading on an airplane. Take all of your 'books' and relax and enjoy your quiet time.
Mrs. A,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This device does not come with a charger while Amazon expects the customer to buy their $20 Amazon charging adapter You might expect this from a 20 dollar no name android device not $130 MSRP Amazon Kindle device. To add insult to injury, the device support chat is not knowledgeable on how much amps this device can handle and suggested using only the ""charger that came with the device""."
dear dianne,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved my old Paperwhite Kindle but had to buy a new one because the battery wouldn't charge any more. Why oh why did they change it? Maybe my new Kindle is a lemon but I've had it for three weeks and am sending it back. It charges very slowly and won't hold the charge, even in sleep mode. I always have it on airplane mode unless I'm downloading a new book which is an arduous task with this new Kindle. It doesn't automatically download new books. Instead a message pops up that the book is unavailable at this time even though it's in my library. Don't know what on I'll buy next but this Kindle is a real disappointment."
Lois Ready,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift but the user seems to be very pleased with it--especially as the pages are so easy to turn--unlike pages in a book. I am responsible for loading new books, etc. and do not find it particularly ""user friendly"". There are so many ads that it is confusing and I find it hard to navigate. Maybe when we have had it for a while it will get easier."
Kelly,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The visibility of the screen is great and I love that it’s waterproof but the interface is clunky at best - especially going from a smart phone kindle app to the paper white device. There’s actually a refresh that needs to happen when looking to lower sections of my library, moving between tabs and even just going from page to page. It is really nice to be able to read outside without the glare and it does feel easier on the eyes but I’m not sure it’s worth the cost if you’re already using the app for the smartphone."
AUfan2012,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: I reached out to customer service to let them know of the issue. What a joke! The third representative I spoke with suggested I follow his prompts which were to go to the home menu/settings/home to reset the device. Helloooooo??? The device won’t turn on??? Is anyone home and listening? Amazon may have lost my business completely with this latest issue.

Dud! Have had this for one year and it has completely stopped working and will not hold a charge. I have kept it in a cover and have not gotten it anywhere near any water. What a disappointment! This device cost over $100 and one year of little use is pathetic. I’m a huge amazon shopper but starting to reconsider where to spend my money."
Zinfin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am really missing my old Kindle.
The power button on this one extends further from the case and constantly powering off when I rest it on my hand or on my stomach. Yes, I know that I am exhibiting poor posture, but that is my choice.
I am also having difficulty with finding the perfect swipe or touch to advance to the next page. This is particularly annoying in the store. Every time I wish to go to the next page, it gives me details on the book that is listed on the spot I touch to advance to the next page.
I do not like it."
Dobie Mom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I'm really happy with my new Kindle Paperwhite reader. I had an older 2nd generation Paperwhite that just quit working (would open and then it would immediately close itself back down) so I ordered the new 10th generation Paperwhite in a bundle (e-reader, leather cover and wall plug-in charger). It is a bit smaller and lighter in weight than my old Kindle but that's not an issue for me."
Kevin Velez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it. This is my first kindle, so I may be a bit biased, but I haven’t had a single problem since the moment I opened it. I’m quite surprised by all of the problems people are having. The screen is great, no pixel problems. The touchscreen works great. The battery definitely doesn’t last weeks for me, although I am a pretty heavy reader and it lasts at least a week which is amazing in my opinion. I would assume if I was a lighter reader it would definitely last quite a bit longer. I’m not a huge fan if the backlight, it seems a little too dim and “blue” for my liking, but it works, so no real issues there. Another thing I love is how there is zero glare in the sun and it actually lights the screen up to a tone I quite enjoy! I also love how it is small and lightweight and am able to read wherever I go without having to worry about it being awkward. I’d totally recommend!"
Jaime927,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been reading in the pool, the Mediterranean ocean, the Long Island sound, the bathtub and it truly is waterproof. I love nothing more than to float on a mat and read a book in the water. My old kindle didn't have a light either, so this is great for night reading and just falling asleep without having to switch off or ask Alexa to turn off the lights!"
Larry Dexter,1.0 out of 5 stars,When I first got this product I loved it until about two hours later. It came with 5.10.0.1. loaded which was fine then it did an auto update to 5.10.0.3. Now about every third page turned it freezes on me. Very frustrating to say the least. I might add I am now on my third one with the same problem. You would think that if they are doing updates without you having a choice that it works properly. I am going to try one more and if it does the same thing I am done with this model.
AmazonShopper,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When every smart phone in Christendom (many now costing less than a Kindle) is equipped to use wifi and web browsers with ease, why does Amazon find this technology so difficult to provide on the TENTH generation of Kindle Paperwhite? There is no better reader than the Paperwhite (the sole reason for a 4-star rating) but the so-called ""Experimental"" browser (which theoretically can be switched to Google) is mind-bogglingly cumbersome to use. Bot only do searches abort, they're difficult if not impossible to delete. I actually returned one device because it seemed impossible that this was not a defect. But the replacement is no better so I have to assume it's still just inferior technology. Amazon's technical support was unable to help. In fact, one support person insisted that browsing simply was not a feature of my new Paperwhite. Unfortunately, though the product descriptions say otherwise, he may actually have been onto something."
Marcus Grode,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received mine today. Turned it on and attempted to register it. I got to the two factor authentication but it wouldn't let me enter anything on the code or anything. Someone online said update firmware from Kindle. That option was blacked out. I had to download the firmware on my PC, plug my kindle into my PC, transfer the file to the kindle then I was allowed to update it. Wait it gets better.....

After the update I still had the same issue. I disabled two factor authentication on my Amazon account. After disabling that it finally let me register it I spent 40 minutes figuring this out.

I should have just sent it back. Good luck"
Big Steve,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give anything to have my old Kindle Paperwhite back. This new one is a piece of junk. It does not process delivery of new media properly. It will not download without individually selecting items once I have instrcuted Amazon to deliver to my Kindle. The touch screen is flaky. The libraries donot function properly. I have nothing good to say about this product. I also had purchased one for for my, and she is having the same problems."
Matt,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle and have read 2 large novels on it. I really like it. Battery life is ok. I’ve read that some people dislike the battery life, but it isn’t a major task to plug it in once a week. Screen is great. My biggest issue is the power button placement. (Just right of center) on the very bottom of the device. I found myself switching off the screen multiple times while reading."
Sleepy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my latest version of a Kindle e-reader. I have had many and they just keep getting better. The screen is smooth all across, my older version, not being waterproof, was not. I wanted a new one since the battery was needing to be charged more and more frequently. I can't comment on the battery life on my new one since I haven't had to recharge it since its initial charge. It has already surpassed my older version however. I am happy with my purchase."
Meg Randall,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first experience with any kind of e-reader. I like most aspects of it, but am astounded by the difficulty of borrowing e-books from the public library. I still can't figure it out. It makes me suspicious that it's an intentional feature by the developers, to force more book purchases rather than utilize our pubic libraries. I will likely go back to borrowing old-fashioned books, and not use the Kindle as much."
Connie Busser,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love the Kindle Paperwite and now that it is waterproof with an extended battery life I have another reason to love it even more. You may want to know why this is my 3rd one. The dog ate Kindle number 2. He has a taste for electronics. That is what led to number 3.
Therin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it. Practically feather-weight until you add the case. My only issue with the lack of an edge between screen and surround, is that I may unintentionally change the page by moving my thumb too close to the screen. Nonetheless, I love the continued improvement on Kindles that are easy on the eyes, as I would rather read than most anything else in life."
Sally Ritch,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My touch screen goes ""wonky"" ever so often: it will suddenly jump ahead several pages, and then refuse to back up to where it originally was. I tried to contact Amazon about this, but online did not address this problem. However, it is so far ahead of the old kindle I had (have) that I mostly love it! I like that it is lighter, has a lighted screen, and can buy books without going online."
Wendy in Washington,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did not think I wanted one of these new kindles as I still had my older one; but this new technology reducing size and wieght mreans I can carry it everywhere in my purse and when I have to sit and wait for an appointment or food at a restaurant when eating alone, I simply pull it out and read away. I am really enjoying a present I through I did not want."
Jessica Sexton,3.0 out of 5 stars,I love the battery life. Last two to three weeks. The light causes the screen to be slightly blue in the dark but still way to read just adjustment. The one thing I really hate is books constantly disappear from your collective you've set up. They see still in the device just removed from collections. I've also had a whine collecting disappear. Really frustrating. Overall I still like this better than my old paperwhite without the backlight. I also love getting the tub with my book and not being scared the whole time.
RCR in VA,1.0 out of 5 stars,I dislike the paperwhite. It hasn't downloaded around 150 of my books. It either takes you to goodreads when you don't want it to or you have to swipe 5 or 6 times to get it to turn the page. Why do I have to have advertising page when I just want my Library. Also the Leather cover is CHEAP. Just go for the cloth one and don't pay as much for the leather one. I only gave it a one because I couldn't give it a 0. Am VERY disappointed. Only upgraded because had regular kindle for over 7 years and was going bad and wanted one with a light.
Prof. Maria S. Carlo,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I never write reviews, but I have to for this one. I am disappointed in this product for many reasons, but what pushed me over the edge was finding out that I could not connect the Kindle to the WIFI at a hotel because the ""Experimental Web Browser"" couldn't open the hotel's sign in page. Went to another venue that also required sign-in, and again page would not open.

I was persuaded by the reviews that claimed that the visual experience was most similar to a paper page. Nothing is further from the truth. Every time you touch the screen it flickers. The touch screen is both too sensitive and not sensitive enough depending on the task you are trying to accomplish. Navigation is clunky and erratic. The kindle app on my iPhone offers a better reading experience! Save yourself the money and the disappointment."
C. Huang,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was upgrading from the old 4th gen kindle. This one has backlight is simply awesome. It also is waterproof! Amazing sharpness of the text and much more responsive to the older gens. Highly recommended.
Rye,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon got us all excited about this Kindle so we got it. When the kids tried to read their books we discovered that most of the kids' book were not able to be displayed on the device. Seriously! Why would Amazon push to sell us a device on which most of our books don't work! It seems to be good with text only books, but not with anything else. Bummer."
Trendychic04,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first kindle. Easy to set up and connect to Wifi. The perfect way to read (when I don't go to Barnes & Noble). No issues with downloading books and navigating the device is easy. Smaller than I thought, fits perfectly in my medium-sized handbag. I highly recommend!"
Patricia,3.0 out of 5 stars,"When my 3-year-old Paperwhite died, I didn’t think twice about replacing it with a new model. Maybe I should have thought more. The newer version is dimmer, more grey, slower to load, slow to turn pages, and jumpier. Moreover, loading content from my cloud library was confusing, as books showed on the list but didn’t all download automatically. It also eats battery life at an alarming rate. The narrow bezel leads to unexpected page turns. The library display on my older model could list collections together with books not included in collections. This one seems to either/ or, so newly added items don’t pop up as being not yet classified. As much as I love the idea of a kindle, this is a bit of a disappointment."
justme,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had (still working on) quite a change and learning curve to my new Kindle. I had my other one for almost 6 years so I am having to learn how to do things on the new one. I am reading almost all my books on my new Kindle and love the compact size and ability to easily adjust font size and background lighting while reading.

I have not figured out how to make the font larger when I am selecting a new book to read, probably operator error. Other than that I love it and hardly ever watch TV any more!"
T Shoemaker,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked fine until it didn’t. The touch screen wasn’t very responsive but now it suddenly will not charge. I let it charge overnight and still nothing. I haven’t even had it any place but in my room at night to read. Good luck trying to get it under warranty you can’t even find where or who to talk to about it. I’ve only had it for 6 months with light use.
Disciple of Christ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Still working on how to use the device. Sizewise, I had hoped it was a little larger. It's also not so good for plans. I had purchased a book on birdhouses. Reading the written portion is fine. It's the drawings and pictures which are difficult to read. Downloading the app to my computer allows drawing to be larger, but it's not the perfect solution."
Pannon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle is rather slow, especially waking up and entering the path code. Reading the book comfortably requires font-size five. Battery life is good, but that's about it what's good with the Kindle. I'll probably give it away to someone and get an iPad..."
Phyllis Cory,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Responding to a prompt for trading in an older model, I received the new Paperwhite Kindle. My older Kindle did not allow me to read at night in the dark, but the new model is excellent for clear and bright print. Thus I have renewed my habit of reading myself to sleep. Extended battery life is a great advantage. The unit looks nice on my night table too."
Debra L. Richard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This new version is lighter and easier to hold and use than my previous kindle. I haven't tested its waterproof-ness yet, but I will when the temperature warms up a bit. Like all paperwhites, it's really easy to read from for hours without getting tired eyes from glare. It fits in my purse and I can take it anywhere and everywhere! I love the display options, too. I really can't (and don't want to) imagine my life without my Kindle."
Necole3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, this is my 5th Kindle I have gotten, I almost didn't need another one due to the previous Generation still was in great condition and I loved it. What sold me on this was being able to get the blue color. Reading calms me and eases my stress. The color blue in my life does the same thing, so to have two items that can bring that all to me sold me."
Jim McT,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Would have given five stars however the screen way past sensitive. Keeps changing pages with movement. when intentionally changing pages it most times goes more than a page so your always adjusting. Its way light and being waterproof is great. However the paper white prior had pages changing buttons on both sides, wish this new one did."
Dristin Schmitzer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this kindle! Being able to adjust the brightness is so nice, it’s easy on the eyes especially when reading for long periods of time! The battery lasts for EVER! I got my kindle for Christmas from my husband and I’ve literally only had to charge it once since then! It’s size is perfect for traveling or just my day to day schedule, it fits right in my bag and really doesn’t take up much space at all."
Kathryn Knight,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this kindle. I've had a Fire for a while now, that I also love, but having the paperwhite is spectacular. it fits in my small purse. The touch screen took a bit to get used to, but it's easy to use and works like a dream. I love being able to have my little book anywhere and to carry my whole library whenever I want it. AND I can read in bright daylight if I want to."
Jackie Miles,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Kindle to replace my old 2nd generation one that would no longer hold a charge or let me download books via whisper net. I like the size and weight, but miss having an actual keyboard to use. This new one definitely has a learning curve, I keep having to do a lot of searching to figure out how to remove a book I have read from the device so as not to use up my storage space. I guess I'm one of those people that doesn't like change, because my old one sure seemed easier to use."
Granvi,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had not charged my kindle for maybe a month and this is what happened!! I did everything that was suggested to recharge the battery. Nothing worked. Because I didn’t call Amazon right away with the problem my warranty was expired only 10 days before I actually called them. They would not give me a replacement honoring the warranty. I was very disappointed in Amazons customer service with this product. They gave me a small credit to use to buy a new one but it’s ridiculous.
K. Prager,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new kindle. The backlight is very nice - no more looking for a flashlight to read. Sometimes the touch screen seems a bit sluggish, it's not as responsive as a phone touchscreen. The battery life is ok, but it doesn't last a month because of all the reading I do. It's still the best kindle, with a comfortable size screen. I love that it's waterproof."
Nettie L. Powell,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am really enjoying this Kindle so far. I do wish you could listen and read at the same time as some have mentioned.

I wish it opened up to my library as opposed to an Amazon type menu with recommendations, etc. I also think the user interface and menus could be a bit less cumbersome and more intuitive, but these are very minor complaints. It’s a great little device and I love that it’s waterproof so I can read it in my pool!"
Adgirl,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had since May. Hate the on button on the bottom. It froze the first time I took out of town. Fixed that.

However, just returned from British West Indies and it does what it’s supposed to do like gang busters! Reading outside is a dream. And no worries about beach drippings since it’s water proof. So, make it in color, put the on button back where it belongs and you’ll have a great product."
Habeas Opus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the waterproofing feature. Something I have long wanted in my Kindle. The screen on this latest model does not seem quite as responsive as the last paperwhite, but I can live with it. No kindle has ever matched the battery life of the Gen 1 in my experience. I have to remember to turn down/off the backlighting to conserve. Likewise with wi-fi. All in all, another solid Kindle."
Janet,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd Kindle and my second paperwhite. I decided to upgrade my paperwhite because I wanted more storage. I bought the 32 GB this time—I had the older 4 GB paperwhite—and I also wanted the lighter weight, audible, and waterproof features. It was super easy to set up because I linked it to my Amazon account—it took about 3 minutes. I love it, and I find that I am reading more. I highly recommend it!"
💜grammy💜,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like that I can read at night easier. Changing pages is more difficult for me. I forget where to put my finger in order
to: go forward/backward/change print size/. I spend a lot of time trying to get to where I want to be in a book if I have closed it and want to start again. I am not happy with it but will keep using it along with my original kindle. I haven't yet, but am going to print certain pages of the guide to have on hand so I wont have to go from guide to book and back so often."
G,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle. It goes everywhere I go, and it has made my life so easy. I’m so happy this version is waterproof and so affordable. Sometimes the touchscreen is a bit too sensitive and I wish it had an option to tap the left side for us lefties, but I love this purchase. The battery-life is pretty good. I expected it to be a little better but I still think it’s pretty decent."
JD,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an older version of the Paperwhite and decided to upgrade to the newest version which, for me offered Audio books via Bluetooth, slightly larger memory, and a slightly larger light source. Thus far it appears to be performing well; however, I'm keeping an eye on its battery life. I noticed that after powering it down, the battery power indicator seems to go down quicker than my older Paperwhite. That said, I believe it will prove to be a very good performer following in the foot steps of its predecessor."
Jasmin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My Kindle won't sync with the purchases I buy through the Kindle app on my phone. Even if I put the purchased books into a specific folder, it won't synchronize. I've tried everything and I'll have to go through the grueling process of contacting Kindle support. Also, the Kindle can be a little bit patchy in terms of functioning speed. But it's lightweight and compact--just what I wanted for long international traveling trips. I really love it. Just wish I didnt have to look up every single book I purchased on the Kindle app one by one on the Kindle and download. My purchases should be able to synchronize when both devices are connected to wifi and it's all on the same account."
Darlene,3.0 out of 5 stars,My old paper white froze up and nothing I did would fix it. So I bought this new kindle. The battery life is suppose to be much longer but isn’t not. I have to charge it way more often than I had to charge my old kindle. I charged my new kindle to 100% to take on weekend trip so I could read in my down time. And battery is almost drained after a day and I haven’t used it that much. My old kindle would have still been more than 50% after reading all weekend. I also like to have my kindle sorted in a collection. My old kindle would add new books behind my collections making it easy to find my new books. This kindle puts them in a different place and I have to go searching for them. The touch screen doesn’t work as well as my old kindle either. Basically I am not impressed with this new kindle. And get frustrated with it.
Greg Jewell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Kindle is old enough to have keyboard and page turning buttons, and required aux. lighting for ""bedtime"" reading. The new Paperwhite is a breath of fresh air. No buttons, and no more covering the book light with a corner of the blanket to please my wife. In just a few moments I'd dialed in a preferred font, boldness and brightness. The instant access tool bar, which is very intuitive, makes everything easy. Buy this product and enjoy the read."
Casual Reader,1.0 out of 5 stars,Replacing old paperwhite and new has the worst human interface of any product I've owned... I do not use WiFi but forced to sync to Amazon where it loaded every book that I;ve ever read. Now I cannot delete or put all in a folder so not seen 100% of the time - very very confusing. And everything else is confusing after my original paperwhite worked so well.
Judith R. Caffrey,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Light, easy to fit in purse. You CAN see outside, will try at the beach.
It doesn’t have functionality of Kindles... like my Kindle Fire. It doesn’t have spy feature. Underlining is clunky and screen is “jumpy” when trying to underline and find a Note.
Just be satisfied that it a very good e-reader , without much functionality. It met my desire to have an outside reader."
J. McGuinnes,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m new to using a Kindle. I previously had a Nook or used my iPad. I love this Kindle. It is so small and light. The battery lasts a really long time. I read for hours and it was on 90% battery life left. I like that the pages don’t turn too easily. The lighting is perfect. I can read without reading glasses by making the font the perfect size. I haven’t gotten it we yet but it is good to know I can.
rip32,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was one of the people having trouble with the operation of my Paperwhite. Hard to advance pages, sudden shutdowns, sudden restarts, etc. I got into a chat with an Amazon tech, and what he told me worked. Go to settings at the top of your screen. Next tap all settings. Then tap device options, and finally tap reset. This erases everything on your Kindle and gives you a new factory download. You then go through just like when it was new, including your Amazon and Wifi passwords.
This worked for me, I have put about four hours on my Kindle without a hiccup."
Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a Kindle Keyboard since 2010, which I have thoroughly enjoyed. I recently took it on a backpacking trip on the AT and the screen cracked on the last day, which was devastating. I decided to pull the trigger on the latest Kindle and I have loved it! I like how small it is compared to the Kindle Keyboard. I love the touch screen. Highlight text is a bit finicky at times, but so much easier than using the keyboard on the older model. I also have loved having a backlit screen. I was also very interested in this model because it claims to be waterproof. All in all, I'm very satisfied with the upgrade."
mckimmers,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love my new kindle but am concerned that it will not hold up to my old one. My new kindle was shipped in a really big box with no bubble wrap or anything to protect it. Wonder if my warranty will protect me from any damage that may have been done during shipping and has not become a problem yet. The only thing that my kindle was in was the box that it came in from manufacturer. I'm keeping my finger crossed that it continues to work well.
bobc,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using my wife's old Kindle for a few years, it finally died, so I bought a new Paperwhite. I am generally pleased, although navigating around it is sometimes a chore. I am also disappointed that it is so difficult, if not impossible, to read footnotes. They are congregated at the end of the book, but, by the time you get there, you have forgotten the reference. Battery life is also not what I expected, but, that is pretty minor"
JoAnnS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like my new Kindle very much! I turned in my old one and got a very good deal! I love the Kindle. Didn’t think I would because I like holding a book, but you never have to worry about lighting with a Kindle. I also won’t have to worry about having it by the pool. I also love Kindle Unlimited! I’ve read more authors I normally wouldn’t have tried!"
Diane Iannone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am extremely happy with My Paperwhite Kindle that I bought on Prime Day this year. I love to read all kinds of books and realized that I will now enjoy audible books too. This Kinfle will come in very handy when I want to put up cookbooks when I cook instead of copying the recipes. It is very easy to read , portable as it has wireless for portability in the car , and great prices for kindle books. Love all the features and all the new books that I can have access to on the amazon unlimited plan. Very happy with My purchase !!"
L. Ernstzen,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This device is so frustrating to use. You cannot access your books easily, or even the menu. I tried to swop between books but could not even figure out how to do that after 20mins of struggling. They say read the manual , but how can you do that when you cannot even access it. Might as well just spend the money on an iPad and download the App which is so much easier to use."
Only the Best!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this waterproof Paperwhite to be able to read at the beach. From that point it is a success BUT the charging cord is too short ( and you have to spend extra to get the component that allows you to use a wall outlet), and the touch screen leaves a lot to be desired. Trying to scroll through my library was frustrating since it is all too easy to open books you don't mean to."
Suzanne Wargo,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have aways had a Kindle Fire. When I went to Best Buy to buy a new Kindle I was interested in the waterproof quality of the new Kindle. The salesman assured me that it would do everything my old Kindle didbut better. Unfortunately he didn't know what he was talking about. The Paperwhite is only good for reading. It doesn't have internet access. You can play games on it. Etc, etc, etc. I was very disappointed and told Best Buy that they needed to do a better job of training their sales people."
Suzy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really do love my new Kindle e-reader, but I miss the stand that was on my original Kindle Paperwhite. The cover was able to turn into a stand for my reader. It could be vertical or horizontal. As I love to read a bit before falling asleep I could have the kindle horizontal. Once I fell asleep it would turn off on it's own. The new Kindle is slightly larger than my original Kindle, but that is ok."
D200 User,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle and I suppose I’m just used to the battery life of my smartphone, but holy cow does this thing last and last. The touch screen is sometimes iffy in response to my finger, but maybe that’s just me. I’m still getting used to the user interface and it’s a little annoying that everything is in black and white, but overall I really am enjoying it!"
Suzanne Ramirez,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I do like the paperwhite overall but I would like to be able to shut it down 100% you can turn off the screen but the battery still drains in a few days, I do not read everyday so that does cause me an issue, I did put on airplane mode which has helped but I would rather power it off, the screen is a little glitchy but it is quick to load and the words are clear and no glare so I do like that overall it is a good product and mostly what I was looking for to read, I wanted to have less glare than my fire hdx that I have had for several years and this worked as a nice replacement"
Ed from Ohio,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Because the old one broke, could not sync to the new paperwhite and even though all the books were downloaded through the cloud, had lost all the collections. Secondly, extremely difficult to navigate compared to the old model have had since 2011. Possibly will get better at it with a learning curve but still don't believe as user friendly. Many new features have been added, but I just want to be able to read the books. I have a PC and tablet for these other great features. I don't need them clogging up the screen with what they recommend I should read. I got that on the menu on the old Kindle but at my discretion. If Amazon is using this a a promotional tool, they should have given the device for free and made their money on the books they are pushing."
Melissa,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Touch screen was already slow at the start, but it really slowed down when I started adding more books and I am not even at 1/4 full in my library. Battery life isn’t the best, unless you turn it on airplane mode. Other than the touch screen and battery, I love the size and portability of it! And I always ready with the light off. I really enjoy how print like it is. I’ve always loved print books, but I have no room to keep buying and storing them. So this is an amazing space saver."
RCL,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a fan of the Kindle Voyage for several years so I thought I would give the Paperwhite a try. I was really disappointed and have returned it. The response to what you ask it to do is very slow. Also, you only have 3 pre-programmed choices as to the size of the print size - small, medium or large. All in all, I find the Kindle Voyage easier to use and much more ""user friendly""."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The new flush design, makes it way harder to hold, creates glare on the screen and for some reason looks less crisp than my older Kindle. It is also slower booting up too. About the only thing that is better is the battery life and I'm not sure if that is because it is new.
It is also heavier than my older kindle. Not exactly sure what they were trying to achieve with this new design."
Anton,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not as good of an experience as I would have liked. It seems to be less responsive then my old paperwhite. Still a solid product, but I have to slow down my touches and wait longer for it to come on. So it irritates me a little. I should have just kept using my old paperwhite. One good thing is that Amazon does have a feature to download the books that are on the old paperwhite to the new one."
Carol A McAlee,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Am I the only one having TONS of Kindle trouble. ""close, cancel, restart"" screen pops up often without my clicking it. Doesn't matter what I click, it will reboot. Yesterday it rebooted three times in 20 minutes. Last Kindle did the same. Returned it for another. This one is having the same problems. I have owned 3 kindles that worked great but now..... not so much. Customer service doesn't offer any help except to say I can return it. Are these new Kindles manufactured somewhere new?"
M.F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the new Kindle Paperwhite!! The battery life is amazing, I haven’t charge it since before Christmas and I still have a long way to go before I’ll need to charge it again! I have very sensitive eyes and they don’t get irritated after staring at my kindle for extended periods of time. I also read on my iPad mini sometimes but the kindle causes less irritation. I’ve had no issue with the touch screen or downloads and the lighting is perfect for night reading or even in the day. So far I am a big fan. The only thing that irks me is that I cannot download a book from the app or amazon, it has to be through the kindle but that’s a minor issue in the grand scheme of things."
Don H,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the smooth flat front surface. One concern that I have with the touch screen is that fairly frequently when I am reading, I inadvertently touch the screen in the wrong place or with more than one finger or else some other way that I am unaware of, and the device either asks me if I want to power it off, or else it simply powers off. This can be quite a annoying, especially since I don't know what I am doing wrong."
LindaAudeoud,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi: I just wanted to thank amazon for returning my old Fire Tablet as I never expected it to be found.
I did one of those trade-in deals for $50 for one of th newer reader paperwhite readers Unfortunately I did not like the small size, also the print was too small. Sent back & asked if there was a possibility that I could recover my old tablet?
I couldn't believe Amazon found & returned. Thank you so so much.

Much Appreciated,
Linda Audeoud"
KatG,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using my iphone and/or iPad for years to read my ebooks. But it’s so easy to addicted to smart phones and Ive been trying to become more unplugged while still feeding my reading addiction. This makes the paper white great: it’s got huge storage, access to the kindle store only, is backlit, and mostly idiot proof lol. The only downside is that when I first transferred my library, I found that the titles showed but my books did not auto download....this was annoying to find out halfway through my transcontinental flight since I hadn’t paid for WiFi. But otherwise I am a STOKED to have this product"
stretch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a long time kindle user. I bought this one for my wife the; ""I only like Paper Books"" long time elementary school employee. She is now a convert, loving the features and size of kindle. Maybe we can now clear some of the book shelves in our office area."
Teramuse,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Kindle does meet my expectations. I only use it for reading books, and I wish I had more time to read. I appreciate the convenience of the Kindle's portability; it is easy to carry it with me.
To have it waterproof is a great feature."
Mike Blagg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My previous Kindle (my second one) was long overdue for replacement, due to some slight physical damage and reduced battery life. I finally got around to ordering a new one, the trade-in process was easy and generous, and the new Kindle (my third one) arrived just a few days later. It is smaller, but only because of the elimination of the keyboard, which I never used anyway. The display is about the same size as the old one, all commands now are done on-screen. The Paperwhite is easy to read, downloads are fast, battery life is great -- in fact, I have only charged it once, and now 10 days later it still has more than 50% battery left. Very satisfied with my new Kindle Paperwhite."
Christina B,3.0 out of 5 stars,This new Kindle 10 2019 turns on/off buttons are manual only. I had an earlier version with a magnet in the cover that opened my book. Instantly. I miss my old Kindle. I just found a case on Amazon that has a magnet auto open ( had to buy another Case. The kindle 2018 is smaller and too small to use for the Kindle 10 2019. Save yourself that hassle.
Yuri,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is much nicer device than the previous (non-waterproof) model.
Still as a non-native speaker I miss the old ""all-page"" version of the dictionary earlier Kindle devices used to have. It is very irritating when you look up some form of a word and the article merely redirects you to the main article for this word - with no way to follow the redirection, the link is not working.

Also, can you please support Google translate instead or in addition to the inferior translation service (from Bing if I am not mistaken)?"
Stressed Out Mom,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not sure if I somehow missed it, but this is a Wi-Fi only Paperwhite! I have always had Wi-Fi + Free Cellular Connectivity. The free cellular connectivity option is very important to me since I travel and am sometimes without wireless. I even checked the comparison chart to make sure the new Paperwhite had the free cellular option. However, this version is Wi-Fi only."
Kathy,5.0 out of 5 stars,I haven't found anything I dislike at this point. I love the smaller size and ease of use. I use mine just for reading books and love it!
Pmweeks71,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. Have only had it about 3 months. Smaller than I realized it would be but easy to hold and tucks right into my purse. Battery life is great if you keep it on airplane mode while reading. Much better than the original one I had years ago! Very pleased with this upgrade!
Jonathan P. Nelson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this kindle/ super light weight/ can be read in a dark room/a ;light room and at the beach... Holds a ton of books//
easy to turn the page.... can be held with one hand.... I guess for all these reasons I like this little guy.. Much better than an apple mac book or other device to read on.. ( I'm an apple person).... This works perfectly for me: Amazon: keep making the kindle paperwhite."
JLJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At this point we know what to expect from e-readers, and generally this nailed it. I can read on the bus, it’s light and compact, I’m 97% happy.

Two weeks in, I’m still getting used to the touch screen and page-turning.... sometimes I get myself a little mixed up and find myself 4-6 pages ahead by mistake. Maybe there’s a setting that can fix the problem, or my brain will catch up. Not a huge issue just not perfectly intuitive"
Chuck Copeck,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had one of the original Kindle’s so it goes without saying it is nice to have something with a touch screen. The Paperwhite is lighter and smaller making it easy to hold when reading in bed. I also like the lighted screen and especially like the dark screen setting so that it isn’t too bright while my wife sleeps. Battery last plenty long as well. Many initial reviews complained about the adds that display when the device is in standby prior to unlocking. I don’t find this to be a problem. Overall it is an excellent tablet reader and I would highly recommend. Especially if you want a something worth the value.
Roselily,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not what I thought it would be. I am in the middle of book, but I don't remember the name. Don't know how to go back to find out. In order to read from my library, I have to go in my other Kindle and look up books to find what I want to read then go to the paper white and type it in. I can't access my library from it. Otherwise it's fine for reading."
jeffrey r hall,5.0 out of 5 stars,Took advantage of Prime day to get a new Kindle Paperwhite and it is a huge improvement over my older pop-up lited kindle. Still on first charge and she is operating perfectly. Backlighting is great and touch screen is a big improvement over the tiny side toggles to change pages. Have to plead cowardice to try out the waterproofing. It will just have to sit there waiting to save my kindle.
VB,3.0 out of 5 stars,"While my old kindle could go on weeks in standby mode (while not in use), this one's battery dissipates rather quickly (within 4-5 days) in standby mode even when I'm not reading. I do not see a substantial difference between the previous paperwhite versions and this one. Not happy."
Gabica,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bought the first by black Friday. After 2 weeks the screen has got white lines... they said I didn't buy protection so they can do anything. I didn't accept this answer so they changed it for a new one. After only 1 month barely use just started to scroll the screen like crazy. We restarted few time, but nothing happend
It is an overpriced garbage. If you buy"
Scott,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First time Kindle Paperwhite owner, and I have to say, I am impressed by it so far with maybe one or two exceptions.
Originally got the Kindle Fire to be my e-reader a few years back, and realize it wasn't quite what I was looking for, so I got this instead.
The display is easy on the eyes, and the built-in light is great for reading in bed.
Also nice and convenient to read news article in the morning on the bigger screen compare to my phone.

The two things that I wish could be better is for it to have a warmer light (something like a yellow tint similar to candlelight, or light bulbs) instead of the blueish-white LEDs for the built-in lights.
The other one, is it being sightly faster on turn pages (But I can't see that happening for a while due to limitations on the tech itself)."
Stan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the Kindle as a Christmas gift to replace an aging Nook HD that had to be recharged every couple hours. I read three 300-page novels on the Kindle on the initial charge. The controls took some getting used to -- not better or worse than the Nook, just different. The Kindle is smaller and noticeably lighter than the Nook, but the screen size is only 3/4"" shorter and 1/4"" narrower. Overall I like it very much."
e s r,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my sixth Kindle. The first of this model. I keep three units going with different books. No other reading source. All kindle. I have been sold on the kindle models from the beginning. They do not last forever though. At some point they will ""burn out"" or go blank. I am willing to take that risk. Kindle is not a perfect perpetual motion machine. Pretty good though."
Eileen,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely HATE this device. It was my own fault for not doing more homework, but, the reviews were good. I find it hard to use and it is not user friendly, at least for me and I think I am fairly intelligent."
Tom B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle PaperWhite is a light device, easy to hold and read. I've only had it for a week and love it so far. My only little annoyances are:
- Very easy to accidentally touch the on/off switch when reading, causing it to turn off.
- First experience with e-paper display (can be frustratingly slow when compared to your cell phone, especially when inputting information).
- Small size in ht/width isn't as bad as I expected for reading. Makes very convenient to hold. Also, very thin and light device. Glad I've switched from Android/Apple tablets which used the Kindle App on them."
RedHerrin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"..which is great. The only draw back for me is that I cannot change the page to a night view as I can with my phone. That does bother my eyes at night since I always read in bed, but I will adjust I'm sure. Overall this is a wonderful gift!

**Part Two-
Yes, I did find it. Well, my son-in-law found it for me. The sad thing is that I even looked there, just completely missed it. Duh, me. lol. Thanks for the help, bookloveranne! You rock."
Bill Lepman,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my 5th kindle and I appreciated always having a book to read just after I finish one, so when I saw the increased memory and battery life I was ready for a new one,,, the battery life is shorter than ever before and I get a warning after 5 hours... not enough,something is wrong, but how does one get help? It's beyond me. I am glad that it is waterproof because in the past my kindle didn't like taking a bath."
Sarah Schroeder,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first digital reader. I bought it partly because I was sick of my eyes hurting after trying to read off the kindle app on my phone and because I could only find the book I wanted on kindle. I like it a lot, but it does not have a lot of processing power and can seem kinda sluggish compared the the powerful phones that most people have become accustomed to. Not a big deal, just something to adjust too.

Also, I (for some reason) didn’t realize that there was no color on these things. Kinda feel like an idiot, but it was an unpleasant surprise sprung of my own ignorance. Other than those two things, I really do love it and would highly recommend it!!"
Historian-Mystery buff,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my first Kindle because, with arthritis in my hands, holding books had become a real chore. And my first Kindle was generally a real improvement, enabling me to read more. This new Kindle is smaller, with a thinner ""margin"" around the screen and a little thicker as well as slightly heavier. It's not as easy for me to hold for long periods. The lighted screen is nice; the touch screen is both easier to use than the keys of my first Kindle and a bit annoying. Overall I like the extra memory and battery life. So trade-offs."
Danielle C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
Easy to use, doesn’t hurt my eyes, I’ve read more in 1 month that I have in 3 years, portable, long charge, light weight, can find free or very cheap books/can also “check out” books

Cons:
Navigating to different screens can sometimes be slow, sometimes difficult to use the search options to find certain types of books you like, lots of the books are only available to Kindle Unlimited that I click on that I want to read."
Delia Pierson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using an old Kindle Fire for years until the battery wore out, then borrowing another one from my daughter, I am thrilled with this light-weight, smaller Kindle that is easy to read and hold for my arthritic hands! I was surprised that it wasn't in color (guess I didn't read the description carefully) but it doesn't really matter as I just want to use if for reading. It's so much easier to carry around in my purse and is very responsive to touch. Really glad I bought it!"
Terri Barlowbrown,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like that it is lighter than my other paperwhite kindle. Not that I plan on getting it wet but a nice thing to add. I bought a non leather cover which has worked well. I wish it had color for my list of books. My mini iPad has color which makes finding my list of books easier. I avoid hardcover books because they are too heavy for me to hold them.
Sagoa,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like my new kindle so far. The reason I traded in my old one is the back light. It is super convenient for the purpose. I like to fell a sleep while reading. The reason I only gave four stars is it reacts little bit slower than my original kindle. It also seems less battery life.
nancy birch,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have great difficulty moving from one page to the next. Often I tap bottom right corner or slide finger at bottom right to left and end up in an entirely different article. Finding my way back is cumbersome and time-consuming.

It is also difficult to access different periodicals and books, and to comfortably search for various reading options.

Changing type size is pure guess-work.

I have read the on-screen instructions but do not find them as user-friendly as I expect.

I really like the screen lighting and enjoy being able to use my paperwhite in various lighting conditions.

I am quite disappointed with your product, and am sorry to say so. I continue to try to succeed with it but am way-to-often stymied by these continuing problems. I wish it was easier to use reliably!"
Doc 158,5.0 out of 5 stars,We had one for a while and decided to get a second so we could have our on. These make traveling so much easier. They are handy to grab it when leaving the house and fit in a jacket pocket.
pwoodr,3.0 out of 5 stars,"i like the size, freat to take on trips. Not a great technology experience if compared to any ipad. but the price helps. Would like to see a continuous scroll function. thats my favorite feature of using the Kindle app on ipad."
KAREN,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so disappointed in the '10th generation' Kindle. First, the battery life is awful, I've been charging it every other day. And of course the new case I purchased a few months ago doesn't fit because they changed the size to force you to buy a new case. I hate the way my library displays, it doesn't correctly distinguish between read and unread books, and I wish I could remove Goodreads. The auto-wake feature hasn't worked with either of the cases that I purchased, both were returned. I am an avid reader, this is my 4th Kindle and I am so disappointed with it. Miss my old Voyage"
shanmarryan,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have Kindle Unlimited and read TONS of books. My in-laws suggested I use this instead of my Fire tablet. I have not been disappointed. I LOVE the long battery life! I can go almost a week before I need to charge it. I love that it is WATERPROOF! Game changer for the summer time or even that long soak in the tub with a yummy glass of wine. The size is perfect for throwing in my purse so I can read no matter where I am.
ND,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything went smoothly with the delivery and transferring all my books over. I like the thinness and lighter weight of the paper white. No complaints about the device. I had to get a new protective cover which was somewhat expensive. Since it was a brand new device there weren't many choices so it cost me more than I wanted to spend. I guess I could have waited and saved some money. Overall I'm very pleased with my new paper white.
Reggie,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have an older gen Kindle and I only bought the Paperwhite because it promised relief of eye strain and at the time I was having a terrible problem with eye strain. Night time reading had become almost impossible because of the strain it put on my eyes. The Paperwhite has totally eliminated that problem. I haven't had a chance to test the waterproof capability yet but find it reassuring to know that it's there.
ILgrama,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did a lot of research on which reader would best fill my needs. This one is perfect. Nice size. Many options as tp print size and illumination. Bluetooth is wonderful as I do mostly audio books with my aging eyes not tolerating long periods of reading. All in all, just exactly what I wanted!"
Orlando Fl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best thing I ever bought for myself. I love this it’s lightweight, battery lasts way longer than expected I’ve been reading every night for 5 nights and I still have more than 1/2 power left. It’s perfect for reading in bed, never have to worry about a light being on or re adjusting a book light. Only problem is I get less sleep because I’m reading a lot more."
Brian J. Kenley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this Kindle Paperwhite! It’s fantastic. The only thing that disappoints me is it WiFi connectivity. It has a problem connecting to WiFi hotspots. It connects to my home WiFi without issue, but any other WiFi it seems to not want to connect at all. I’ve tried rebooting and everything that amazon recommends and it works occasionally. I can’t seem to get the kindle to connect to any xfinity WiFi hotspot."
LL,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible. I received this today & it doesn’t work - the screen freezes when I attempt to register it. I looked online for fixes but they didn’t work. I then went to Amazon Chat for assistance. The agent took five minutes to respond each time. After more than an hour, she couldn’t get the device to work & couldn’t get her system to reflect my account info to send a replacement. The device is going back & I’ll continue to live without a Kindle."
Riley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So my old Kindle touch finally broke after nearly eight years, and I finally upgraded. This model is everything you'd expect from a Kindle, the backlight doesn't make it any less easy to read than my older Kindles, the storage is enough that I've yet to have any problems even with a couple hefty reference books downloaded, and the convenience of one of their magnetic covers is a nice addition. The only big issue I've got is the menu interface, I've paid extra on this Kindle and both of my previous ones to not have to see special offers, but this model's menu detracts from accessibility and puts the books you already own in a submenu. The rest of the screen is taken up by recommendations and shopping lists, neither of which I ever check from my Kindle, but even if I did I wouldn't want it on my home menu."
D. Hayes,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the 32GB version for audio. I don't know if it's my BT speaker or the device, but sometimes there are pauses. It would be nice to be able to use the audio option for listening to music as well (Amazon does have Prime Music).

Characters are crisp and clean and superior to previous paper white versions.

I didn't spring for the cell option because of price (Almost double than what it was with the previous version) and WiFi is almost everywhere.

I will only test the water resistance ""by accident""

Definitely an improvement."
Motorjock047,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this as a Christmas gift to my wife. She is an avid reader, and now she is able to download all the books she wants to read using the Amazon subscription service. She has access to a multitude of books, and all she has to do is download the one's she wants to read. It is a very convenient way to have your entire library at your fingertips."
Michael T.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am primarily a reader of novels. Physical paperbacks represented my trophies which I put on the shelves in my home. My collection piled up and became cumbersome. The Kindle Paperwhite was a terrific answer. No more physical books to deal with. Plus, it is so small and light I can fit it in a pocket. I love that thing and very much enjoy my reading."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had Kindles since the first generation. I'm still using my Fire that's nine years old. This is my second Paperwhite. It is wonderful. The screen is beautiful with even print and light. I read for several hours a day and the battery is holding up as advertised. I've read the reviews and have no idea what those reviewers are talking about. I've found this to be a wonderful Kindle, I recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent e-reader."
L. M. thompson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Have been using about 3 weeks and it is great sometimes I forget it is not a real book and look to turn a page. The adds are not an issue sometimes kinda nice to see something different but only at startup. Much better then my phone or the old kindles was worth the cost to purchase.
Marilyn in NJ,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I spent a lot of money to get this Papperwhite. I wanted to have a new player in addition to reading in sunlight. WELL--- I tried to add my own books to play through the bluetooth speaker, BUT -IT ONLY PLAYS A WISPERSINK BOOK. What a waist of money.
I also don't like the opening page advertisement of this ADD FREE version that I paid extra for."
aires,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned three Kindle Paperwhite's since 2013. I recently purchased their latest model a few weeks ago. Everything was fine except it kept skipping pages. So, I called for tech assistance but their recommendation didn't work so I returned it and bought another one. Same problem, it skips pages and cannot be fixed so I'm just going to live with it. I don't know what has happened to Kindle's product quality standards but I guess they don't care as long as they have guys like me that will own one despite imperfect operation."
H. Sullivan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My 9th generation paperwhite Kindle screen was scratched so I wanted to replace it. I purchased the Kindle Fire HD 10 and liked many things about it but realized it too big and heavy to used read books. So after a time I went back to using my damaged Kindle paperwhite. Immediately I enjoyed how light and easy it was to handle. When the 10th generation paperwhite came out I knew it was something to get but I waited for it to go on sale. When it did, I purchased it."
Nab,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good day, I got to prepare and read some references for now so I uploaded a book related to my work as a start. By the beginning it requested me to update and it was a simple process. but I noticed that some Symbols like the Registered Trade Mark Symbol (R) is not showing. The graphs of my PDF file did not showed clearly too. But overall I can feel its a great device that will help you to read more releasing the heavy weight of a book. If got a chance will review again."
bbeckstead,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got this as a gift for my wife. She has been against e-readers for a while but she decided she wanted to try it out. The refresh is a little weird but the battery life is outstanding. She read three books in the first week! Best purchase I could have made.
MNIAMO,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was reluctant to buy this based on reviews but I actually really enjoy it. Perfect screen, weight and battery. My only complaint — which speaks to all kindles I’ve owned — it that there’s a lag in swiping. I wish it was faster without delayed action. Apart from that, it’s a perfect device and I’m glad I bought it. Supposedly it’s waterproof but I’m not anxious to test that feature."
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it to read books and it is good for that. I also was going to try some audio books, but this reader is terrible at adding Bluetooth devices. It took forever and much trial and error to get a set of headphones added. I couldn't get anything else added though, so cancelled Audible and will just read. I like the size and long-lasting battery."
sharon harida,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is taking me a while to get used to the differences between this paper white and my old 1st gen kindle. I love the fact that it’s waterproof but not that I’m going to purposely test it. The battery lasted way over a week and I read 2 or 3 books a week. The smaller size makes it easier to fit in my purse for traveling. Glad I got it and hope it lasts as long as my old kindle.
LoriH,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like everything about this kindle except the on/off button. It’s right where I hold my kindle and i accidentally turn it off all they time. Since the kindle page doesn’t rotate it would be much better it the switch was on the top.
Terri Ford,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hesitated to purchase because I LOVE books, I love to touch them and highlight and see them all on my shelf, but when I travel lugging around books gets heavy so I made the jump to the KINDLE and I just love it! I love how light it is, I love that there is no glare, I love the ability to adjust the font and size to suit my needs, and I love that I can take it to the pool or in the bathtub with me!"
James,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by saying that this Kindle Paperwhite actually got me back into reading. I used to read relentlessly in highschool (graduated 2007) but have only read a handful of books between graduation and now. Since receiving my Kindle Paperwhite at the beginning of the month, I've read nearly 9 books. That's 3 per week, and I'm not an especially fast reader. My only qualms with it are the slow response time in the touch screen - which may be an effect of the e-ink screen itself, and the awkward placement of the power button on the bottom. I like to hold my kindle with one hand, and if it's on the right hand my pinky is being used as a support on the bottom - which usually hits the power button making my Kindle go to sleep in the middle of my read.
I know, I know, it's not much to complain about. I still rate this 5 stars."
Mememeow,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered one, Broken. send another Slow, Unresponsive, could not even check out a library book, I tried 3 different libraries. I returned both readers and case. I so far have not received a refund. tech support was a joke. I chatted with amazon about my refund, I was told it would be takin care of, has not. I am using a 10 year old Nook reader that is working like a charm. I expect better. VERY disappointed"
Gayle K,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No more hiding in the shade to read. This is much smaller than my Kindle Fire. I like that it fits in my small hand bag and it's lightweight. I had a busy week with no reading time and left my paper white in my purse all week. When i opened it, it still had 97% battery. My Fire would be long dead. I don't see any down side to this as a replacement for paperbacks . I love it!"
DBlackdog,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally decided to purchase a new kindle paper white as I was reading on my phone that had glare and a first edition kindle that was slow and battery life sucked.
This is just right. Right size to hold and read. Battery life is great. It’s about as close to reading an actual book as you can get and it’s waterproof. Thumbs up for this product.
Thx amazon."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the weight and size and the light. BUT it's doesn't have cellular connectivity. If I had known I wouldn't have bought it. Customer support informed me that I have to pay $260 to get cellular connectivity. Very disappointed. If you just want a nice e-reader buy the least expensive one. I only bought this model for the connectivity when away, when I often am."
Wit,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I did not give 5 star as I am still getting used to it and learning to navigate the features. It is as described: lightweight, love the lighted face (you can adjust it's brightness), waterproof, able to read my favorite magazines now, easy to download items, and with more memory that my previous Kindle. I was disappointed it does not support some of the games I have in my older model so I'll keep the older one for that reason. For someone living overseas who does not have a lot of room for books, Kindle Paperwhite suits my needs and it is worth every penny."
Sweetreet,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the 32 gig Kindle Paperwhite...Like that its light in weight..fits in my purse don't even know it's there...also the water proof feature...My Samsung tablet was bulky and had to watch it all the time at the beach with sand and water...best of all when I finally got it registered I found all my books from the Kindle app on my Samsung tablet, transferred to the paperwhite!! Love this!"
LarryB,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had debated for some time whether or not to get a new Kindle or another type of reader or perhaps a tablet. I finally decided I wanted something lightweight that was book-like focused. This new product is wonderful, it's easy to hold, it's easy to read in different types of light, it seems just about perfect. I'm so glad I made the jump to the Paperwhite. I can read it at the beach as well as in a dimly-lit room as well as in the car or on the train. Recommended."
Ducati,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything is great about this kindle. I had an older one with a keyboard on the bottom and it was great too. The biggest improvement for me is the back lit screen. Using it with other light is still better because the back light is a weird tone that isn't very comfortable to look at. But it's better than not having a light or using an attachment like I did with my old kindle. The touch screen is cool and the front face is all screen so there's no edge. It's perfect basically. No issues. All weaknesses resolved from my old kindle.
carolmhsh,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle. I gave previous Kindles 5 stars. This kindle seems to maintain it's battery life, particularly since it isn't being used to read books. I gave it a 4 star for battery life just because my two previous Kindles batteries lasted weeks. The lighting from the home screen is easy on the eyes but what good is it if the tablet won't open."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a number of kindles over the years and love them. When this one was offered I decided to upgrade since the waterproof feature would be good since I often vacation at the beach or on boats. Since I have owned it I have constantly have had to reboot it since it will not turn on. When I reboot it, it will show that it still has a lot of battery life left. I contacted customer service they tried to say It wasn’t charged which is not the case. They refused to acknowledge that this product is just flawed or clearly has a giant quality issue. Don’t waste you money. The waterproof feature does not make up for the fact it just doesn’t work!"
Omega1951,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely no glare , I thought by reading some of the reviews that there was , but turns out it's only a reflection. MAJOR difference. Where I'm going into the hospital it is fabulous during waiting times. Especially since it only weighs a few ounces. Great for Dr offices and atrium waiting areas.I used to use my Ipad but this is just so much more handy,lighter and zero glare, I almost kick myself for not getting it before"
B Tall,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not like the feature that prevents the book from disappearing from the kindle when you delete it. Apparently i have to delete the book from my account before that happens. I will use my old kindle because of it. I like to keep the books in my library so I can refer to them if necessary. That's definitely a bad addition. Get rid of it.
The other new features are a plus."
Monica L. Borne,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Kindle because we just put a pool in so the water resistance appealed to me. However after receiving it, I decided to return it and keep my other Paperwhite . I love Kindle readers and can't even stand to read a paper book anymore but this one doesn't feel like a book like my other kindles did. I was amazed at how much difference just a few tenths of a inch made but this one is too rectangular and definitely not wide enough. I love Amazon and have been a Prime Member since day one but this product just doesn't cut it."
Anne Wilmoth,1.0 out of 5 stars,I read almost all of my books from the online library. This Kindle will not hold a charge and locks so I cannot even charge it. I had the same problem with my first Kindle so I upgraded. I cannot enjoy reading on this Kindle because I have to constantly charge it when it hasn't locked me out completely. I have read one short mystery and am halfway through a Bill Bryson. Basically I paid for something to read on but it is too frustrating to use. I wasted my money once again on a useless device.
D. Ann Horer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the whole concept of the kindle paperwhite - and this one (my second one) is REALLY great. It is so lightweight and the battery seems to last forever. Also books are easier to locate on this new one. A lot of upgraded features have been added since 2012 when I bought my first paperwhite (which by-the-way) is still working fine; I just wanted another one for back-up.
JenJen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my amazon Paperwhite. It’s easy to use, very light weight. I had previously been using a Nook glowlight. Having the amazon paperwhite has been more cost effective as I have hootenanny many free books using my prime membership. I also love that it’s waterproof! This far the battery has been fairly long lasting. Only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because when I purchased it the wrong charging cord was in the box. Apparently this has been a issue with the paperwhite. When so called Amazon send me a new cord next day so they did resolve the issue"
Diego Porras,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The kindle is more than I spected, the device is really light weight and thin. No poblems while holding it whint one hand or a couple fingers.

The letter seems a little, just a minimal blurry; so no HD or 4k here jaja But enough clear and comfty for reading a couple hours.

The reason am giving 4 stars to this great device is the charge dont last that much, a friend of mine has an older model of kindle an as long I remember the battery lasts a little more. I spent arround 20-25% of the full battery in arround 5 hours of continous reading. that means in a weekend I might run out of battery! Hope I dont!"
TooBadSoSad,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was working for 3 months until we went on vacation and did not charge it for 2 weeks. Now it has a battery icon with an exclamation mark that won't go away. The LED does not light up when charging so I assume it's dead as dead. Amazon orders tells me it is not eligible for a refund but that, "" Replacement may be possible through Nov 24, 2020"". Now I've spent an hour trying to find a way to do a replacement but I'm giving up for now. Maybe another day."
Irene K Roberts,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle was pretty easy to use right out of the box. Receiving a printed instant use sheet would make the beginning more simple.
Read a book in several different places with varying light sources. No problem. I would recommend the Kindle to anybody. I read paper books as well and newspapers. I even read cereal boxes."
Gwenith A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband got this as a birthday gift for me and I've only been using it for a few days but I absolutely love it! I used to have another e-reader but I love this one so much more. The backlight works wonderfully and the battery life has been good so far (I charged it once four days ago and have been reading a lot but still have a good amount of battery). I love the native connection to Goodreads, as well! I am usually a physical book person but this is so much easier for on the go. I would recommend this to anyone!"
Miss M,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am very pleased with my new Paperwhite. I especially like the fact that it’s waterproof as I love to read and n the hot tub and now I don’t have to read through a plastic bag! The battery life is also much longer. The only downside is the location of the odd button on the bottom. I tend to hold it with my finger along the bottom and I keep hitting the off button.
AnaJoLynn,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am just super frustrated that Amazon feels the need to advertise to me 24/7. This is my first kindle, I had been using a tablet for the app before, so I don't know how long Amazon has been using their kindles as non stop billboards, but I object, maybe enough to get rid of it and go back to a tablet. When the kindle is off, there is an advert showing at all times. Too bad, I like everything else about it. How can the richest man in the world feel like it's just not enough?"
Michele T,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The operating system visually reminds me of a Mac from the 1990s. It flashes inverted colors every time I tap anything to navigate or slide to unlock it. I pretty much hate the way this works. The reading experience is slightly better when you are in the reading app, but I find it difficult to get the menu to come up without turning the pages. I yell at it a lot."
Vinniej,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Others complained about the on/off button on the bottom being easier to accidentally touch compared to previous models...they are 100% correct!!! Accidentally turned it off three times the first hour and started a return. However, I changed the page settings to landscape an MY issue is resolved. Still should not be this way but rather than return for a lesser model, it works for me. I’ll hold off on the return until I know I have no issues with the button again."
M. Swanson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth Kindle and I love them so much I have collected more than 4500 books. I have always had the newest book I ordered come up on the first page that I see, but this time, all 4500+ books were downloaded onto the book in alphabetical order to my dismay. I have not figured out how to delete books or how to send them back to the file at Amazon which is very aggravating. I like the new Kindle, but I don't love it."
montana,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon's new paperwhite e-reader is a home run. It works much like the previous paperwhite; though, this one seems brighter, easier on the eye, a tad lighter, easier to read. Icons are improved and user friendly on this model.
After having the previous version 5 years, I felt it wiser to replace it while it was still working and accept the offered $25.00 ""rebate."" Overall, a good decision!"
D. Morris,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've tried a number of kindles before and always found the lighting uneven. This kindle provides very even light and I enjoy reading at night with the inverted display made possible through the accessibility settings.
Emily M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this kindle this past black fri. I'm a big kindle fan anyways and I was upgrading from an old ancient kindle, so this was perfect for me. I really love the built in back light, as my other 1 didn't have any type of light at all, so this was a big plus for me. Battery life is pretty good. I chose the 32gb storage option and it's really nice also, I never worry about running out of space. Overall, I'm really happy with this kindle and i would recommend!"
Peter M. Siegel,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decided to trade in my older, non-paperwhite, which still worked beautifully. A mistake. First, new paperwhite came with the wrong cable. Called Amazon, authorized a free purchase of the correct cable. Ten days to deliver what should have been shipped overnight, since it is Amazon's error.
The issue that really makes me sorry that I upgraded is how the paperwhite handles books I load from my computer, rather that the Amazon store. With the old kindle, the list on the home screen was collections, followed by books not in a collection. That made it very easy to see newly added books and to place them in a collection if so desired, or if they didn't fit any collection just leave them in a list following the collections. With the new paperwhite, if you show collections, you don't see any items not in a collection. So, if you want to see something outside of a collection, you have to scroll through everything you have on your paperwhite. And, if there is a way to avoid this problem, it is so hidden as to avoid detection."
SunshineFL221,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is simply a reader and even then it is more difficult to manage than the Kindle application. There is no indication of battery life at the page mode and when trying to find your next book you have to ses all the advertising from Amazon. The pages are harder to turn on the Kindle app and its harder to open and close a book. I'm sure I'll be replacing it sooner rather than later with another Fire
Daniela,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle, so I really can't compare it to the other ones, but so far I couldn't be happier with it. I'm the kind of person who used to always buy the printed copies (I love the smell and feel of books). But I've got to admit this is a really practical way to carry around your books when traveling (it's really light and easy to take everywhere) and it really does feel like reading an actual book (compared to tablets and reading on your phone). The waterproof feature it's really just a wonderful plus."
Deloris Bostic,4.0 out of 5 stars,I had hoped that it would be even easier to turn pages but there is actually a slight lag in the time I tap the screen until the next page loads. Very noticeable after using an older version of Paperwhite. The battery life is ok for now. I'm sure it will get poorer with age. Not really impressed and the waterproof really wasn't important to me since I never read in the tub or the pool.
Claire Mostel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far (I've only had the Kindle for about three weeks), but so far, it is everything I was expected and needed: small enough to carry easily, very lightweight (I have arthritis in my hands), and easy to read and use. Unless there is a malfunction, I don't anticipate changing my opinion. I love my mini iPad, but it is just too heavy for me, especially when reading in bed. I only regret that I resisted a reader for so long!"
SoCal Gigi,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I probably need to adapt to it but unlike my prior Kindle, this is solely black & white with a gray scale and shockingly, solely an e-reader!! One can not access the web or download other apps( like ones fav photos, suduko, calculator, solitaire games... all gone ;’-( ); it’s keyboard is a tad sticky and slow to respond to ones input. I truly miss my 3rd colorful Kindle. However it is very lightweight and easily fits into the palm of ones hand."
Unmai,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Lighter in weight, and Built-in light are the improvements from my previous version of Kindle ! I traded-in my 2015 version for this 'Paperwhite' expecting the non-lit display to be really white like a paper. But I was disappointed. The regular display is just the same old yellowish ! The back-light makes is brighter. Also, the weight is only slightly lighter than the old one. Flush front screen and waterproof are ok, not something absolutely needed. How often do you dip your Kindle in water ? Overall, I'm satisfied, for the new features. But I could've still lived with the old one."
Melissa i Cunningham,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My new Kindle is great, I'm still getting use to it.
What I don't like is the Trade-in option. they gave me $15 dollars for my 8 year old Kindle, then took back $10!! Like I said, it was 8 years old, the screen had NO scratches or cracks and the battery still held a charge!! WHAT MORE DO THEY WANT?
I am disappointed to be treated this way. I am a good customer and Prime member. What does $10 mean to Amazon? It means a lot to me!! That's 1/2 tank of gas or meat to feed my family for a week or laundry detergent for a month or......I could go on and on.
WHAT DOES THAT $10 MEAN TO YOU AMAZON???"
Jim,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using the less expensive ""standard"" (lowest price) Kindles for several years and I think they're fine. (The latest version with the light must be better.) But my vision is not as good as it used to be so when the new Paperwhite went on sale I bought one. With the higher resolution and the built-in lighting I find it much easier to read. I'm very satisfied with it and highly recommend the Paperwhite Kindle."
milosopher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Now I can read in bed without hurting my eyes. Previously I used androids with Kindle apps to read my kindle books but after a short while I started to see a halo around everything I looked at. Eye strain at its worst. I can read an hour or two at a time with my Kindle Paper white without hurting my eyes. This is a great little kindle device!
DilibertoGirlJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,I waited a while before reviewing. I have several Kindle Fires but I love this thing. The battery lasts for weeks. Its small and fits into almost every purse I have. No pinholes or spots on my unit like some people had. Its lightweight and doesnt hurt my hand. The only complaint I have is the bookstore. I dont like the format they have for the paperwhite. I am just used to the Fire tablets I have and that is user preference on my end.
distorted_silence,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven’t had a device in almost 10 years, when I had the original Nook. Sadly, that wasn’t at all what I’d hoped it to be and dashed the idea of trying another reader. When I started looking at the new Kindle Paperwhite, I was still hesitant about it but liked the features, seemingly intuitive interface, payment options and the 3-month trial of Kindle Unlimited. Any hesitations that I did have then have been annihilated- I couldn’t imagine life without my Kindle now! My only complaint would be that you can’t turn the device off completely, as there’s only an option for a “sleep” mode. While the battery will still last weeks, I still would like the option of a full shutdown- it’s not as though Amazon needs to know every device’s location at all times."
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love everything about this device except where the lock screen button is located. It's very easy to bump while relaxing on a chair reading, I wish it were on the top of the device. Other than that I'm in love. The simple navigation, backlight, and feel of the screen make reading more enjoyable and the small size of the device makes taking it anywhere easy and painless."
Tirzah,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, I like the Kindle. I use it most days and have increased how many books I read in a month exponentially.
However, the advertised battery power isn’t all that. It USED to be. I got my Kindle February 7, 2019. At first, I was amazed because it would last two weeks without a charge, even if I read several hours most days in a week. Now? Now, it’s two months later and I can’t get the charge to last a day. I never let it just sit on the charger while it wasn’t charging because I know that can ruin a battery, and it hasn’t been dropped or damaged. If you’re getting a Kindle for reading, I absolutely recommend. If you’re trying to upgrade to some fantastical battery power, don’t waste your money. You’ll be dazzled and then swiftly disappointed."
MrTIC,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to have a Nook and then moved to Kindle in 2018 because of the benefits from my Prime account. Amazon has already had to replace my Kindle twice now since 2018 due to issues I was having with the device. Overall I think the Kindle has a great features - light weight, good functionality, easy to read the ""ink"", etc. Just frustrating that I have had to replace the device twice now (same issue) and therefore giving it 3 stars instead of 5."
Dirk Walvoord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am still getting to know my paperwhite but to date it has done everything I've asked and I was surprised at its compact design. I am an author who is going to pitch my eBook at a writers' conference and I expect that handing this to potential readers at the book-signing table will be like, ""This is what it could look like if you download 'Andy'."" At least some of them will be impressed at the vehicle they're viewing it on and that has been one of my goals in buying it."
Susha,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only thing I wish is that it flipped open like the old one as I could hang it over my treadmill and read while I walked, or hang it over my knee while sitting and reading. The trade-in process was so simple and easy and so glad I took advantage."
elaine,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I borrowed my son's while in Maui after a bad fall put an end to some of my activities. Ended up reading all day, and fell in love with his Paperwhite.
When we got home, there was one waiting for me at the door.
Really enjoying it, even though I love the reality of a real book in my hands. The Paperwhite might make me a convert, especially for travel!!"
NW,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to turn wi-fi on to airplane mode and reduce brightness in order to have battery last longer. My previous paper white did not require that in order to have a long lasting battery. Also, sometimes difficult to post a page mark, as it keeps pulling down the whole top menu. I do like the lighter weight, but still prefer the outer edge on my previous paper white."
Doug Barlow,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the reader, particularly for outside use, but realized after I got it that I use Libby a lot for library books and have a good number of books on the apple book app. Unfortunately, there is no way to read books for either source on the Kindle.

Also, I have a number of older texts in pdf format that uploaded to Amazon and appeared on my Ipad app, but not on the Kindle reader.

It's an excellent product, but awfully limited compared to using the Kindle app on a tablet."
cinji,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the Paperwhite’s lightness and ease of me holding it. I had an Oasis but it was awkward and heavy for my arthritic hands. The Paperwhite has all you need, nothing you don’t, and the price is right."
Lois,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my husband to replace his old Kindle. He can read multiple books during the week, so this is great. He loves that it is light weight, that the screen is bigger than his other one and his ability to make the letters larger. The capacity is larger so that he doesn't have to worry that he will not have space for all his selections. He is totally converted from hard copies to the Kindle."
TASHA B,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I read quite a bit. With my previous Kindle I had to charge about once a month with a constant back light on at all times. The light was never on high, but light enough that I could read in the dark before bed. I didn't have to worry about changing it during the day. The new Kindle battery only lasts me a week if I'm lucky. I only have the back light on at night and have the light shut off during the day, and no Wi-Fi or Bluetooth on at all. Not very happy with having to charge it a lot more often. It still offers me a great read and I love my kindle, but if I knew it would have had a much shorter battery life, I wouldn't have upgraded."
KellysHero718,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Kindle Paperwhite is excellent, as expected. I had the old one for four years, and there's no reason to suspect this device won't perform as solidly. It's light but sturdy. The screen is bright and clear. It loads quickly. The addition of Audible is a fabulous feature. I don't know that I'll take it swimming with me, but it's good to know it won't be a disaster if we get caught in the rain."
Tari Rogalski,3.0 out of 5 stars,I do not like the touchscreen. It’s harder to get the books that I haven’t read yet - unlike my other kindle where I could see the new books separately from the archived books! It also says some of the books I’ve read are not read!
Cindy22465,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Charges and dies within an hour. changes books i am reading, changes pages without touching. My Grand daughter can see the kindle books i own and she is not old enough to read my books. Very unhappy with how kindle works. I gave my grand daughter one and bought books for hers but all my books show up too . Bought earlier this year and it should last longer"
Twonaps,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a replacement paperwhite, my first generation USB port was broken, it would have cost more to repair, but Amazon was there to help replace with this new generation Paperwhite. It’s lighter and packaged very nicely, can’t fiqure out the built in light, I think it’s the same light control as my First Gen model, it’s yet too early to comment on battery life, but optimistic on improvement, I was very pleased with my prior device’ performance."
MochaJoey,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this E-Reader, it serves its purpose well.

The only thing that drive me absolutely insane is that the ON/OFF button is on the bottom of the unit. You can’t rest it anywhere without turning the damn thing off when reading. I’ll need to find a bulkier case- the Amazon one I’ve got isn’t thick enough to protect the button but looks great."
DruAdams81,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gave this one as a Gift, But my wife has one and she loves her's. I would buy one for myself but they wont ship them to my APO Box so I won't be able to get one until I go home on R&R.
EDIT: I purchased one when i went home on R&R. Very happy with it, but be sure to turn off the WIFI when traveling or it greatly reduces the battery life searching for a wifi hotspot"
Harry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle paperwhite was feeling its age, so it was time for a new one. So far I am very pleased. The new screen resolution is much better than what I was used to, the touch screen, while not yet perfect, is much less finicky, and the battery, in airplane mode at least, seems to be holding its own. And the overall weight is less. Probably a wise upgrade on my part"
DTK,2.0 out of 5 stars,Huge disappointment that this product only displays in black and white! Who would even question that in the year 2020? Maybe the non-glare screen limits the ability to display color but Amazon should disclose this as less pricey Kindle models display color so thought this would too. Wrong! Like the size and readability in the sun but do not like the on/off button on the bottom as too easy to close it when reading. Would not recommend.
Bill,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I lost my previous Paperwhite. With my new Paperwhite, I am still puzzled as to how to add 5-6 e-books to my que. With my new model, I can only have THREE books in my que (e-book currently reading plus the next two e- books). Also, there doesn't seem to be a simple way to go from Portrait mode to Landscape mode. Can anyone help? Thanks."
Shanrocks94,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't had any other kindles before, but this one works nicely in my opinion. I read around 2 hours a night and I charge it every week and a half/2 weeks or so. Which is fine with me, it doesnt take long to charge back up when it does need a charge and it's easier than reading on my phone. The light is a good touch as well because you dont have to use a lamp or anything so bedtime reading is even easier. Worth it if you read alot!"
Pearl R. Meaker,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've had my new Paperwhite for a couple of weeks now and it's just as much a joy to use as my old one was. I am really glad that it has the screen that is similar to real paper and ink as I spend a lot of time using my computer and it makes a nice change.
poo_bear,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my new Kindle and I HATE the whiners here on Amazon. The new Kindle is indeed lighter and easier to read. It is also smoother and feels nicer in my hand. I almost didn't get it reading all these whiny negative reviews on Amazon but, I'm glad I did. Yeah, if you already have the previous gen, it's not a huge improvement where you have to run out and buy one but, mine got stolen and this one is lighter and waterproof? Sold."
Nicole Mitescu,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new Kindle and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I probably don't know enough about all it can do or how to do it. I still find managing my books to be clunky but the Kindle itself is a delight - lighter than the old one, easier to read and with a longer lasting battery. The size is good for me too. I have it without the ""suggested books"" advertisements at the beginning and love that too."
Geoffrey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It probably isn't fair to rate my new Kindle Paperwhite to the 2nd edition Kindle that I traded in, but even compared to my spouse's 4th edition it's so much better. The viewing is excellent, size and weight make it a dream to use and pack, and I no longer fret about the battery dying in some forlorn location. Lots of features: I recommended downloading and studying the user's guide - very helpful."
Lori Knutson,4.0 out of 5 stars,The battery life is horrible. I have an older model that has triple better battery.
Brian Jack,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love being able to read in the dark, get comfortable in bed and read without having to reluctantly get out of bed to turn off the lights to fall asleep. Having access to all the books I am interested in for decent prices is also a plus. And I've had this Kindle for a good 2 and a half maybe 3 weeks now and I have put it on the charger 2 times. Once when I first got it to have a full charge. Then I just charged it up again the other night, and I still had a good few days left of battery life before I charged it up. I didn't believe the battery actually lasted as long as they say but I'm a believer now. I'd definitely recommend buying this either for yourself or a gift. My lil sister loves the one I bought her. It's a part of her now basically. Can't go wrong with buying one of these."
Brenda Reynolds,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own many kindles. Seems like every time they come out with a new one, I must have it. This paperwhite is easy to carry, as it is very lightweight. I go to the ballgames with my kids and between games, read. Sunlight has no effect on the reading ability. Read in the dark, light, sunlight, it doesn't matter. Still have a perfect reading experience. Downloads anywhere. Love it."
Noreen Baldwin,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got mine, ALREADY frustrated with the responsiveness of the touch screen. The download process is painful as well- my phone and my kindle fire are WAY faster at downloading content."
BF,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been reading Kindle books for years, mainly on a Samsung tablet, sometimes on my phone, and occasionally on a desktop computer. The Paperwhite is a game changer! Portable, always available, and a very good size compromise between phone and tablet. Can see that I'll be getting through many more books than would have been the case before. My only complaint so far is the lack of color. Doubt that will be a real drawback, though."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all I like the reader, especially in bed at night, easy to read, but hard to hold, even with a cover, the battery definitely does not last weeks, if you actually read books on it. I got two and a half days reading one book. And there is also a glare, I cannot read it sitting on my couch with a window behind me. But with all that it is useful and nice to carry around."
Joyce Schaaf,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was my Christmas present to myself. I had a paperwhite Kindle that was almost 4 years old and felt it was time to get a new one. I bought the package deal and the only problem I had was what color cover I wanted. I received it and it was so easy to transfer my contents from the old one to the new one. Having arthritis in my hands and wrists I wanted something lighter and this is lighter then my old one. It charges faster then the old one and you no longer have to unlock it when you start to read. Thank you for a wonder new Kindle.
Shannon Ellis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely great purchase. Never thought I would buy a kindle in my life and was so insistent on sticking to paper books. But then I discovered that you could get ebooks from the library and decided to buy this on impulse. It’s so easy to use and the battery life is amazing. I took it confidently on an extended trip without the charger because I knew I wouldn’t need it. Easy to adjust the lighting to read in bed at night or on the beach. Love that I can use it near water without being afraid of ruining it. I kept complaining about how I have been wanting to read more and now I am because books are so easy to access this way.
Krista D.,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love my new Kindle paperwhite! It is my first kindle that is exclusively an ereader. I love how portable it is and the waterproof aspect is reassuring for the times I read in the bath or at the pool. Since purchasing I have been reading significantly more. My only complaints are that without a home button it took a bit for me to figure out how to use it. (Has to look it up.) I also wish it was a bit quicker at “waking up”.
Margie P.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I READ FOR 2-3 HOURS A DAY. I HAVE OWNED A PAPERWHITE FOR YEARS BUT THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR SPECIAL OFFER AND UPGRADE TO THE NEWER LONGER BATTERY LIFE MODEL. I CHARGED MY OLD MODEL ABOUT ONCE A WEEK. THIS NEW MODEL HAS TO BE CHARGED EVERY 5-6 DAYS. I'VE ALREADY SENT IT BACK ONCE, I WAS TOLD THE SOFTWARE WAS UPDATED, BUT THE BATTERY LIFE IS STILL BAD. WISH I HAD MY OLD ONE BACK. BATTERY LIFE WAS THE PRIMARY REASON I UPGRADED."
Abdulaziz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My kindle came with problem with the small piece inside the socket which doesn’t allow me to charge my kindle the piece was leaning down little bit but it’s not loose ( literally,I can’t insert the micro USB ), in my situation i really need the kindle now so I can’t return it and I can’t handle any delay, so what i did is trying to elevate the small piece as gentil as possible using different items, and it worked .
I really thought amazon products will not have such factory issues but what you can say ... ."
Frank,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Something to beware of - if you buy the Kindle version that allows ads, then decide to pay the $20 extra to stop the ads, you won't get the $20 refunded! :( if you decide to return the Kindle.
Or at least, not without a fight. So far I received a refund on the original purchase price, but Amazon is silent on refunding the extra $20. Now I have to spend time tracking that down."
Goshen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon rejected my trade in Kindle stating it was cracked. Amazon returned my trade in and there is nothing wrong with it. No cracks or scratches. I have been unable to reach anyone to help with this issue. I do like my Kindle very much.

I called and spoke with a live person and I was issued a credit in the amount of my trade-in value. Thank you AMAZON!"
A. Whelchel,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle White is smaller than my original kindle (2009) and much lighter weight than my Kindle Fire. I got the 32gig version with is probably overkill but it means I can carry around all my magazines and most if not all of my books. I have not tested the water proofness.

All that said, I am not sure it is worth the price I paid since the Kindle Fire was only $49 and plays movies. So far I am not overly impressed."
Melissa Cruz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well I havent had it long but so far I like it. Was confused about how kindle unlimited works and some things are still unclear. You can select as many books as you want but they will just sit in the que until your at the proper limit which is 10. It should stop you at 10. Books waiting to download take forever if theres more than one. I feel you need to improve this. I do enjoy using it for reading
P. Thompson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Had battery life problems with first purchase but amazon came through and gave me another one. Couldn’t connect replacement to my wi fi (probably my fault) so had it unregistered so I could give it away. Problem is no one I knew wanted it. Will try and connect at later date. If unsuccessful will wait for Xmas and donate to some child. I do like the paper white but it was hell on my nerves. I think this was an isolated problem.
KingRam,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am used to ipads and got this as a waterproof, lighter traveling reader. It is much smaller. This makes reading a little different. Easy to hold due to light weight. Sometimes touch screen does not respond as quickly as desired. Could be user. I think it will be fine once I use it more. Have not tried out some features like audible yet."
Lisa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is the lightest one yet. Screen light works great and has a wide range of light amounts. Works great in bright sunlight as well.
I don't mind swiping past the special offer page. No more than swiping open your smartphone.
I like to read in the bath or at the pool. It is easy to read in sunlight and the new water resistance gives me more confidence there."
Rita L Williams,3.0 out of 5 stars,Did not come with charger. Have not explored options yet. Longer battery is good.
JOPass,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived like this as shown in pic. Will return & get a replacement. Box was damaged, & a dent on the device was present. Waiting for customer service to reply back."
Brenda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I held off for quite a while thinking my old Kindle was good enough. I absolutely love this new Kindle. I read every day on it and I find it's battery life impressive and the light is great. Reading in bed is incredibly easy without having to have the nightstand light on or a little book light.
I'm so glad that I didn't wait longer.
Love it!"
Tracy M,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Will take some getting used to. I’ve been using the Kindle app on my phone so and read with black background and white/gray lettering. I’m also used to my books listed being in color so it’s definitely taking some getting used to. What I don’t like is when I turn a page it flashes black background with white lettering, then goes to normal."
M. Denniston,4.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased a Kindle Paperwhite without a build in light before this one and it worked good for me during the day. Most of the time though I am reading at night time. I decided to get the one with the build in light. I am very happy with it. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I believe it could have a few more features as in Kindle Fire.
DSGood,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love reading on my Kindle. I tell everyone I know who loves to read. This is my 3rd Kindle. I gave away the first. I lost my second (left it on a plane). I didn’t know what to do. I looked on Amazon and it was so easy to replace while keeping all my content. I was shocked that I could do that. So for very little money and time, I was up and running again. I won’t make that mistake again, although it’s pretty common. I use a bright orange cover so as to make it visible. It’s wonderful."
Jeff,5.0 out of 5 stars,My wife reads an average of a book a week on her kindle. It is very convenient to read on the kindle. The lighting is optimized. It's the size of a small paperback book. She has her entire library at her fingertips. The print size can be increased to make it easier as your eyesight gets worse with age. It helps to make reading a joyful experience for her.
krsbookworm,2.0 out of 5 stars,A great Kindle to use if you need it to be waterproof. But the battery no longer holds a charge and it's only been used 14 months. Can't find any replacement batteries for the 10th generation (2018) Paperwhite. Can't find any support info either.
Anne Luther,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from an older PW. There is not much difference but the print is sharper. Being able to increase font size is a big plus. So convenient when traveling. I tried reading on my iPad, but there were too many distractions - email, messages, games, FB. No distractions when I read on a Kindle PW. Loved my older one and love this new one."
Pierre J. Jacques,1.0 out of 5 stars,THE KINDLE WORKED FINE UNTIL IT JUST DIED. I HAVE PURCHASED 6 KINDLES AND THE ONE I HAVE NOW (NO. 15) IS WORKING FINE. YOU KEEP SENDING ADDS TO UPGRADE TO THE NEW KINDLES. WHY WOULD I? PLEASE ADVISE HOW TO RETURN FOR REPAIR. TRYED HOLDING IN THE POWER BUTTON FOR A LONG TIME -NOTHING. TRIED TO CHARGE AND THE LIGHT TURNS ON BLINKS AND GOES OUT. IT IS BROKEN!
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this newer model about month ago, so far it's working well. This review is about Kindle Paperwhite overall including previous edition, I already had 2 pw stopped working already right after 1 year. First one only display half of the screen(random), 2nd one started bootloop, and started to display random after hard reboot. It's great when it worked, though."
Megan Perkins,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's good. My eyes don't hurt and there isn't the blue glow of reading on my phone or tablet. It still keeps me up too late reading and I hoped it wouldn't glow so much to bother my bedmate, but it does. I can switch it to black background and white text and it's better, but the number of touches to get there is silly. For some reason I thought these settings would be more intuitive and faster to reach. And, yet, I like it."
Ralph E. Decker,3.0 out of 5 stars,I had the first version of the paperwhite but it was starting to get laggy so I decided to upgrade to the newest version. It is a disappointment. While it is a little faster than the first one it still gets bogged down and laggy. It is just not a good experience to search for books. I find the Kindle application on my phone and tablet to be a much better experience.
Chuck,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this kindle as a Christmas gift and it is one of 4 different kindle readers that I have.
I read books from either amazon, my local library or free ebooks on my kindles.
Generally kindles are ok although I have one dislike that is common to all the different models that I have. I find the location of the power switch on the bottom is too easily activated. The older slide switch was not as bad as the push buttom used on newer models which is easier to accidentally turn off as I find I hold the kindle by the bottom to read.
My new kindle the power switch seems much easier to accidentally turn off, very annoying. Also the new kindle uses icons for the books in the menu instead of a printed list of titles as on my older units. I find this very annoying as it is often hard for me to read the print in the icon to know which book I want from several choices.

I would say that for me, this new kindle offers nothing over my older kindles. I suppose water resistance is a feature but I’ve never felt a need for that."
Bre,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ll be the first to admit that I’m not a reader. I didn’t want to come home and open up a book to relax in the past. This changed when I bought my kindle! I love it! This battery lasts a long time! I can download the ebooks my library has to the kindle for FREE! Free I tell you. It also has a backlight so that you don’t need to be near a lot of light. Now I look forward to getting home to dive into my book on my kindle. I’m hooked.
Kindlelover,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my 3rd personal Kindle in 10 years. This last one my husband gifted to me because I needed more storage. I use it everyday! It would be the one thing I would take to a deserted island!
Craig Valadez,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm so glad I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite. It took a little time to getting use to it. But I am quite happy how it enables me to save so much space in my small camper van. I use to have books flying all over the van while traveling around. Now all my books are stored on the Kindle. Problem solved!
anonymous,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had the kindle paperwhite for a couple of weeks now, the only thing I have to judge it on is the kindle fire I used for reading my books, I feel it is lighter, it is much smaller than I thought not sure why they didn't make it the size of a paperback, I use the large font so makes a page very short. Turning the pages is much slower than my fire it's constantly adjusting when turning the page, my fire did not do this it was very smooth. Bookmarking is very slow you hit the corner (sometimes I have to hit is several times to get it to come up) then you have to chose the page number and then bookmarks it, with the fire I pressed the corner and it automatically bookmarked. I will get used to the changes it is just different it is easier on my eyes for reading."
Rick,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I not only use this Kindle for books to relax with, Science Fiction and History, but I also use it to store references such as Math, Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, Astronomy, etc. Then, I also use it to store user manuals such as a Bread-machine, my Camera, electronic test equipment, Ham Radio stuff, etc., plus recipes for my kitchen appliances. This thing is my portable library, I love it!"
Jon O,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I went from a Kindle Voyage to the new Paperwhite mainly due to the fact that I found the Voyage uncomfortable in my hand. The Paperwhite has just the right feel for me. The battery life so far seems to be fantastic and it works as expected otherwise. I highly recommend it to anyone considering a new Kindle.

My only minor complaint is that the power button is very easy to accidentally hit. I suspect that putting a case on it will eliminate this issue though."
Tonia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just needed a simple, non-glare and lightweight Kindle to read with! This has replaced my generation 4 iPad for Kindle book reading as I have connective tissue disease and arthritis. This takes the pain of reading on a device or heavy physical book and makes it a thing of the past! I couldn’t be more pleased with this product!! Great job Amazon!!"
Lepus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the Kindle Paperwhite, and this is my second Paperwhite. My previous one was working fine, but I wanted to add waterproof and audible functionality. That's why I upgraded. The battery life is around 9-10 hours if you leave the wifi on, or else it usual Gives three days. That's the only drawback for the Kindle otherwise it's my best friend"
PeggyK,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The touch screen is difficult, often requiring multiple swipes to achieve a page turn, while my Apple products, while significantly more expensive, seem to work effortlessly. I replaced a fire I was using as a reader because the touch screen got balky but this one is only slightly better. Perhaps I erred in buying to low on the ladder."
ellsea,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Add me to the list of people who held out for so long because “I just like the feel of a real book,” only to discover that reading off a kindle is even better! I didn’t think I’d like the size, but nope, love that too. I freaked out a bit at the resetting of the e-ink before discovering that that’s normal. Wow, why did I wait so long? Easy to set up library borrowing."
Kevin F.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a Paperwhite since they were first introduced and have always loved them. I purchased the 10th generation for the waterproof feature which I haven’t actually tested but I do read while floating in a pool so its just a matter of time before the unit slips into the water. I do miss some of the features on my older model though. When you turn the unit on it has a ‘warm up’ period then asks you to swipe to activate. I don’t know why this is required...the older model was ready to read upon opening the case. Also, the font size options are reduced to 3 options where before I had a sliding font option with 10 or more font sizes. This was especially helpful to adjust the font to HUGE when I read at the hairdresser without my glasses."
BlackMetalMagic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved the paper white when I had it several years ago and finally got another. This device is great but I am still getting use to the interface as I am use to the IPad/iPhone/kindle interface now. Everything works fine but I needed to delete some downloads that I thought were books not audiobooks. Figured out how to and now very happy!
acg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an iPad with which I am joined at the hip so I was a little skeptical when I was gifted the Paperwhite. I was afraid it would be just another device that duplicated functions with those I already had. But here's what I really love about the Paperwhite Kindle--it is small and lightweight and so, so easy to hold and read. I don't know how they fixed the screen/light/display but it is easy on the eyes and I don't have the sense of it being too small. I can stick it in my purse or take it to the bathtub--easy, peasy. I love it!"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I works very well, except that the touch screen for dictionary and notes is so sensitive it's sometimes hard to get past them just to turn the page. I like that the new paperwhite is water resistant, but my older device was simpler to operate. The on/off button on the bottom is also too sensitive, I can barely brush it by accident and turn of the device. It's just a bit disruptive of the thought process while reading."
Bonita J Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the Kindle paperwhite as a Christmas gift. My daughters have been trying to get me to transition from ""real"" books to a Kindle for years but I always resisted because I like to read in the bathtub. I must say I'm really liking the convenience of having an unlimited selection at my fingertips. Leaving on a cruise and I have 10 books downloaded on my little device.... and it's waterproof, so I can still read in the tub! The only drawback that I see is that there is no web browser....therefore, you cannot ""check out"" books at your local library. After I use my 3 free months, I will have to sign up with Amazon's service that charges a monthly fee for downloading books."
James Walsh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle continues to improve and become more user friendly. This new version is the best yet. Not only is it water resistant, but it also has a great display and is smaller, lighter and has increased memory capacity. I have been using the Kindle since its introduction and this is my favorite version thus far. Highly recommended. We purchased the bundle with the cover and the AC charger adapter and they complete the package nicely."
The Finkledinks,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE this kindle. I had an older paper white and always wished I could read it in the tub. I saw that this version was waterproof and preordered it immediately. The screen itself is similar in feel and appearance to my old kindle, but it does seem slightly more clear. I prefer the paperwhite for digital books, as it is most like reading a book. This does not hurt my eyes in any light and works wonderfully in the tub."
Thor's Hammer,5.0 out of 5 stars,All in a petite package the $129.00 Paperwhite Kindle is a real upgrade from my first gen reader. The clarity and compact size is manageable one handed from tablets like the Samsung S4. Carrying my reading to bed using my tablet was a literal pain. This Kindle let's me read longer. This isn't my first however. I owned maybe a first gen that had no light but did have a keyboard. Was that 10 years ago?
Darell J,5.0 out of 5 stars,My first paper white I had to return and amazon customer service was exceptional to help resolve the issue before and after there seemed to be no avail to getting it to work properly. Got the new one and it was perfect and charged without any issues. The readability is amazing and enjoy it much more than my iPad when in the sun.
Marlowe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered the new Paperwhite because my 3-year old Paperwhite was starting to have performance issues -- freezing up, slow on the page turns, etc. The new Paperwhite solved all that and is generally faster and smoother to use. From a tactile standpoint, the entire front is one flat surface, rather than the screen being slightly indented into the frame as was the last Paperwhite. Not a significant difference, but I find it better. The only negative is that the power button is either too raised or in a different spot. I have inadvertently shut the kindle off a few times just by holding it in my hand to read. It occurs only occasionally and with the cover on or off. Not a big deal; just a minor design flaw."
Mr. B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great reading and readable screen and brightness. Touch sensitivity is not speedy, and slow and odd page flips. Good: Light, small, battery lasts forever, readable matte screen."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was excited to get the paper white as I had an older version of Kindle with no backlight. I like the backlight and the battery life, the smaller size which is easier to put in my purse, but I am disappointed in some other aspects. The touch screen to turn the page does not alway respond the way I want, turning several pages at once or not turning back a page even when I touch it several times. I feel that access to my library is not as straightforward, and it takes several steps to disconnect from wi-fi. In many ways, I liked my old Kindle better."
Jesse Cox,1.0 out of 5 stars,"You get 6 months of Kindle unlimited but the books are of poor quality. I can check books out from my local library but they're incompatible with this device. Amazon sells my school textbooks but they're incompatible with this device. As an Anthropology student, I wanted to study Mentalism, the top selling book for that category? Incompatible with this device. The only books which are compatible with this device are poorly written."
vbinaz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a Kindle fire and the battery does not last at all. This e-reader at least has a battery that lasts and you can read it in the daylight. It's light-weight as well. Just have to get used to it, as not all my books downloaded to it easily. Took time- and had to download each one separately. Wish Amazon would just allow the unit to download the unread books at one time."
Bruce Towe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the previous version of paperwhite, and was hesitant to try the new. I love the flat surface feeling, with no borders, and still a matt finish for the screen. Performance is better than the previous one I had, and all the 'old' ways of doing things are still there, so the transition was seamless to me."
S. Gorman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really needed an upgrade. Badly. I had one for 8 or 9 years that worked fine but the connections that operated the light in the case finally started to go. Not good if you read at 3AM like me. The ability to change the light intensity is incredible, since it is easier on the eyes for readers in the dark. Why didn't I do this sooner?"
Abby Timmons,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace my kindle from 2013. The kindle store experience on the old kindle was horribly buggy so I traded in. Frankly, the experience isn’t much better on this new one. The lag and lack of responsiveness from the touch screen is unacceptable for 2019. The battery life is just as bad or worse than the previous one. I’m not especially happy with the purchase but I expect this to not crap out for the next four or five years so I guess it’s functional. I would prefer a mid level kindle to purchase. It feels like the Paperwhite is bottom tier but I’m not interested in a whole iPad, which is basically what I consider a Fire to be."
Steve Fleischer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle Paperwhite died - the battery gave up the ghost after 2 1/2 years - OK I guess.

Bought the new and improved version - twice the memory (and an upcharge if you don't want advertisements - felt a little like a scam when I saw that). But the battery didn't even last two weeks. Battery will not hold a charge.

Back it goes."
L. Stanley,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love every Kindle I have purchased, and the Kindle Paper White has not disappointed me. I have spilled full glasses of water on it with no problems! Thank goodness, because I would cry if I did not have my Kindle. Love the ease of the setting function and ability to read in the dark without disturbing your partner. Highly recommend and will definitely buy another Kindle, this is my 3rd, they last forever as I still own my 1st generation, and my husband uses it and I also still use my Kindle Touch 1st generation as well."
ALT.,2.0 out of 5 stars,When I read the description “whispersync” and “audible” I concluded that the immersion reading feature would be finally available. For my surprise it does not. Product promptly returned. Back to my iPad/Kindle app...
Amazon101,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Another terrific Kindle. This is my 6th? I believe. I enjoy everything “Kindle” and this is the best yet. AMZN has made it easy to surf the IStore and locate and purchase books.
The only negative is
The screen is VERY temperamental to finger touch, which can result in multiple pages being turned at one time, instead on one page."
Ann E.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"~ This is my 3rd Kindle, each one has improvements that I didn't know I wanted ... until I had them. Rarely will I be seen without it. Love the definitions of words. This latest Kindle Paperwhite can be easily read outside in the sunshine."
Joe Baseball,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The idea of big storage for a big library is a great idea. I tried an Oasis with 32 gb. I wound up sending it back. I bought this Paperwhite with 32 gb. I didn't send it back, but I should have. Everything else is great, but the battery is atrocious, and that negates all the good qualities. I look forward to Amazon figuring out how to put an adequate battery in these larger storage Kindles. They certainly haven't figured it out yet."
Saltwater Diva,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was going to trade my old Paperwhite in for this new waterproof model but after setting it up, it lost its charge in less than 24 hours while it was turned off. It looks like I will have to speak to customer service to get this one and a second one I purchased as trade ins returned because Amazon's usual return service isn't working appropriately for this particular transaction."
Arie Avraham,2.0 out of 5 stars,Beware before you buy. The description does NOT mention you will not get a charger.
JJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We are boaters and don't have a lot of space for books. I have an old kindle and wasn't sure that I wanted to let it go. However, when Kindle came out with the Paperwhite, the new features persuaded me to switch. It is waterproof, it has a bigger memory for storing books and it has a longer battery life. When you are off the grid on a boat, these features are wonderful! The new paperwhite is much lighter than my old. It's easy to use and easy to read in low light or sun light. I added a fun cover for both protection of the device and to make me smile!"
Kevin Durbin,1.0 out of 5 stars,We got this kindle just a few days ago and noticed that when you put it to sleep it shows ads about books. We were pretty ok with that but then one day it showed an ad for an erotic novel with an inappropriate title. We immediately contacted Amazon support to get the ad removed and they said it would cost $20 to get rid of the ads. This is terrible i would never want my child to see this ad and the only way to get rid of the ads is to pay amazon even more money! Will never purchase again.
Julia Ho,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe I've been using a smartphone and tablet too long and think that everything should work the same way. Not so with the Kindle. I don't find it intuitive at all. If I want to accomplish anything, whether it is adjusting the settings, or trying to delete a book, it takes me many tries. I finally succeed after a lot of frustration and trial and error. Maybe for someone who has never used a smartphone or tablet and is not used to how intuitive they are, the Kindle may be fine.

There is also a delay in the touchscreen. I password protected my Kindle, and when I punch in the code, there is a lag which is off-putting. It makes me think that I missed a digit because it takes a while for it to catch up. So I punch in the last digit again, and then my password is incorrect and I have to start over again."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I only got this because Amazon obsoleted my original PaperWhitr.

This one will turn pages for no reason. I’m regularly trying to flip forward or back to get back to the page I was reading.

It is slow to respond to touch.

Adjusting screen brightness takes an extra touch compared to my first PaperWhite."
LaLucy TN,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very pleased with the new paperwhite ereader. I had the 3rd edition keyboard kindle and thought about upgrading and backed out several times after reading reviews. Finally, a good deal convinced me to trade it, 20% off new one. It is much better, lighter, easier to use, good for ebooks and audible, Bluetooth allows for headphones."
Lynn C. Hunneyman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the 3rd reader I have purchased, first one wore out from usage, the second one started developing issues downloading new books and now this one. All three have provided hours of good reading, I use them daily sometimes for hours since I have had some recent orthopedic surgeries requiring extended down time. I highly recommend these Kindle readers to anyone who loves reading as much as I do."
vinney1369,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Just don't get it for reference material, like DND books, cookbooks, dictionary/thesaurus, survival books, etc. The pages turn really slowly and it is very obvious now that it is not a quick flip device. I knew it would be slower than a regular tablet because of the e ink, but man, it is SO SLOW. At least a few seconds a page. For a regular story book I bet it'd be fine.

Also, the splash screen is a busy mess of ads and free services I'll never use and will never be able to get rid of. It's a pain to pull up your personal library, and thumbing through that is slow too. Bah."
Mommyof3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For years, I used my iPhone to read, but it was giving me eyestrain. Kindle is totally different - somehow the screen is flat and matte, like paper but better! I am very happy with my purchase! Tucks easily into my purse, I just keep it in my travelers notebook instead of getting a cover. Battery seems to last a long time. It really makes reading a joy!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have really come to enjoy the Kindle Paperwhite. This is my second. When I got my first as a gift I really didn’t use it too often, as I was a “I like feeling a book in my hands” guy. However, as time went on I found myself being swayed by the convenience, ease of use, and travel ability inherent in its dimensions. I’m hooked! I just convinced my wife to get one for herself, and she’s enjoying just a couple days into the experience. I still like to hold books, but this item fills a huge niche in the life of an avid reader."
Greta Treiber,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read a lot and the battery on this guy is NEVER ENDING I swear. Love that the light is so dimmable so that it doesn’t affect my ability to sleep at night and it doesn’t bother my partner at all if he is trying to sleep. I also cannot overstate how LIGHT this thing is, it weighs like, a feather. Lol. It’s tiny but perfect and you can adjust the font size. So many awesome features I wasn’t even expecting."
B. Armellino,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the 10th generation. I have a 7th generation and I am so glad I upgraded. Love that it transfers all my books to the new device. I am addicted to my kindle. I love real books, but the kindle is so convenient."
Willieb285,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This device would not connect to several Apple bluetooth devices including Ibuds. Called tech support at Amazon and they couldn't figure it out, even suggesting that this Kindle reader (10th generation) doesn't support Apple products. Let the buyer beware here. Have returned this product."
Michael A. Sinclair,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow.... All I can say.. My old Kindle lasted me 20 years... I didnt always carry it with me.
However this one is newer design, sleeker, smaller, and with features that make it more user friendly...
Well worth the venture pricing was great. Very easy to down load all my other books that were on my old kindle to the new one."
Veggie Girl,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a replacement for my old Kindle that finally died. It seems to work like the first one I had but this one just seems like the built in light is not quite as bright as the old one even though I have it on the Max setting. So far that is my only complaint and it's a minor one - I just like my Kindle pages to be bright when I read. I guess I'll get used to that part of the new Kindle.
surfagrl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a phone and a tablet- neither of which I like for reading unless I have to.... so kindle’s advantages- the light and font don’t bother me- iPhone and iPad sometimes are too bright- is that a thing? And my eyes get tired, particularly at night with my contacts on. It’s also easier to hold than the other devices and lighter. I carry it over my tablet."
Cathy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the backlight feature which makes the Kindle easy to read in bright daylight and at night without additional light in the room. When traveling it is nice to ""load"" the Kindle with books to read and not lug all of those books along. It is also small enough to fit in my purse, especially nice when flying to a destination.

The battery needed to be recharged sooner than I expected, perhaps I did not turn off the unit correctly? Have managed to touch the screen in the ""wrong"" place while turning the page and stuff appears that I am not wanting.

Miss the feature showing me how many chapters are left in the book; if it is there, I have not found it. The number of words read is not a helpful feature for me."
dragonsam,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was so happy to get my new Kindle after having a 2nd generation Kindle that lasted a LONG time. It is so lightweight compared to my original but I wish it was just a little bit bigger. Let me explain.....I am 70 and having arthritis in your hands doesn't make it very comfortable holding an item so small. I'm glad it's not heavy. Still getting use to it.
M. PFAUTZ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The kindle paperwhite design is excellent with respect to readability. Just one problem has landed it in a drawer. It doesn't want to connect to my wifi. It scans and doesn't see it. I manually entered the network modem's name and password and it still didn't work. For now I'm just reading my kindle books with my Samsung Galaxy Note 8. I'd return the Kindle Paperwhite, but I hold out hope for a solution. All suggestions welcome. Thanks."
teefbee,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my previous Kindle Paperwhite until someone stole it. My new one takes longer to turn on (it says it's warming up) and worst of all is the power button, which is so sensitive it turns the Kindle off when I prop it up to read or when I hold it and the button touches my hand. The battery does not seem to last as long either."
Robert W. Murray,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this newer version of the paper white. I have the original and this is far superior. Lots of memory, same great screen, your eyes don’t get sore, and seems much easier to work. This is only and e reader. But it does it’s job great. And you can get it into your pocket if necessary. Slightly bigger than an I phone. A must for the avid reader."
Leah Stacy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had been reading on my phone so getting the paperwhite was exciting. The battery life has been the biggest advantage. I can read an entire book on one charge. The size is perfect, fits right into my bag."
elyse,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Kindle to read comfortably, especially in bed. It is a disappointment in several ways, more so now that it isn't working after only a few weeks and contacting Amazon has been frustrating and intrusive. I would like to speak to a LIVE person; connecting Amazon to my iPhone and laptop in unnecessarily intrusive. Also, your graphic designers need a reality check: tiny fonts printed in blue may be trendy but are difficult to read. There are other issues that I'd be happy to discuss with you."
auntie nee`,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So lightweight and holds 100's of books!!! I am a voracious reader, and some books are like old friends that you want to revisit periodically. This reader not only stores all my books but allows me to organize them is a variety of ways. My old reader was making me delete books to download more.
I also love that I no longer need the lamp on to read!!! No more bothering my hubby with a light while he sleeps!!!
My only gripe is that if I create a ""folder"" and then delete it...the cloud holds onto it."
Wendy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle. I got mine as a gift, as I always said I preferred having a physical book. However, I have to admit that this is a great way to read a book. It is so lightweight, and perfect for traveling. I can read it outside with no problems, and the light is just perfect for reading, and not having to keep a lamp on at night bothering my spouse trying to sleep. It is so easy to bookmark a page, and the battery life is amazing."
Sean W,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I enjoy the simplicity of the experience and the clarity of the type. It’s super easy to hold and doesn’t fatigue your hands like an iPad. The backlight is awesome and the batter is amazing, this thing never dies. Don’t expect much in terms of speed clicking around navigating, but it’s a rock solid and enjoyable reading experience."
Mike Stevenson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Never did like the IPad for reading at the pool or beach because of glare issues. His solves that problem. Combine the with the long battery life and the fact the it is waterproof makes it ideal for any situation.
Ruth Ledesma,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle stopped holding a battery charge, so bought a new one immediately. I read somewhere around 12-14 hours a day, so having it last several years was a true blessing. I have no doubt that my new one will serve just as well. Not interested in all the fancy add-ons of e-mail, etc., I have an iPhone for all that. I just want to read books with my kindle."
Henry G. Green,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my fourth Kindle. I lost the last one. The new one works like the last one. Don't know how long the battery lasts since I haven't had it long enough to test it. Kindle has spoiled me . I no longer enjoy holding a heavy hardback. It does no more or less than what I want;it captures books and displays them for my reading. I don't care whether it has e-mail or can be used underwater.
Roger J Sendelbach,4.0 out of 5 stars,The front surface is entirely one screen and I was used to holding the edges. I added a pop socket to the back and that works .This is my 3rd Kindle. I wore out the charging receptacle on my 2nd one. It died a week before vacation so I had to buy a new one before I could leave. A vacation without a Kindle? No way!
Chris Marlowe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Kindle is best because it's just a new Kindle. I love my Kindle because it's a great reading tool for travel especially. Thus, things like Alexa that could have been included aren't that useful. Flat screen, more storage, waterproof, this is exactly the upgrade I want."
Andrea Sholtis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mother is an avid reader and bought this for her for Christmas. She’s not tech friendly... but took to this easily! She loves the ability to increase the text size to reduce eye strain. Sometimes has issues with the touch screen because of the “invisible” buttons that you need to know where to swipe to find. Take advantage of local libraries to get free rentals - ours is part of Waggin which hosts a huge free rental collection of best sellers.
"Dena, Conway SC",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I almost cried when my old school Kindle died. While I had received a Kindle Fire several Christmas's earlier, I just never fell in love with the color screen for reading books. Imagine my surprise on Christmas morning when my husband gifted me with a new Kindle Paperwhite! I love it! Was surprised at the new smaller size but I actually like it much better, it makes me feel as if I am holding a paperback. As for my Kindle Fire it has it's own special place in my heart.....I love to use it to play Scrabble!"
Gerardo Zelaya,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I want to start off saying that I am an avid reader. More specifically I have always loved reading paperback books. I thought the kindle would take some of the joy away from that, but it has only enhanced my reading experience. I originally bought the new entry level kindle, but quickly returned it for this one. I love the light. I have never had a problem reading it in any setting. Everything else is as advertised."
BeBe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Think I’m going to really like this for reading...small & lightweight. Will be easy to stick in my purse. Also easy to read outside.
Guess I’m spoiled by the responsiveness of an iPhone, but I wish that the scrolling on the paperwhite was more fluid instead of slightly jerky. However, I can live with this.
The battery lasts long enough, but I thought it would last longer.
Downloading a book is super fast!!!"
Cervantino,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product! The fact I can read at night without disturbing other people is a big plus for me. The screen although small is sufficient for me. It is easy to change fonts if needed. Another advantage is that the word dictionary is very handy as you only have to press the word that you want to search and it will bring the explanation. In overall very pleased with this device. To top this the price is very affordable!
JennyLynn22,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perhaps something was wrong with my previous version paper white, but this one is great. There's no 'shadowing' along the page and I love that the screen is all one level. Also, the battery is holding up just as long, if not longer, than my older version. (It was the previous version released just prior to this, I got it in 2018.)"
Ashlyn Martinez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this Kindle so much. Reads great, even in bright sunlight. I made a case for mine out of a book cover, and it feels like I’m reading an actual book. Love, love, love. Cannot say enough good things. 1000% recommend to anyone who loves to read to get this. I find myself reading way more than before because I can take it with me everywhere. Battery life is also great - when I’ve read a lot (like 6 books in a week).. I still only had to charge it 1x/week. And even then it wasn’t completely dead, just getting low. So in love with this device. Buy it FOR SURE!"
Kim,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not nearly as good as the kindle I just traded in for this one. I find that the battery does not last as long, I read a few hours a day. The light adjustment is not as good. It does not turn on when I open the cover I purchased for it like my previous one did. I would say that this newer version is not worth the money because it's not better but actually worse."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The device works really well and I love that it’s waterproof. My wife and I used ours on our beach trip this summer and they work great. My only complaint is the position of the power button, which is on the bottom of the device. It catches my hand and turns the kindle off while I’m trying to read it. This is a huge design flaw in my opinion, as most people will support the weight of the kindle by holding it from the bottom."
Barbara Gist,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love using a Kindle. It's like carry a whole library in my bag all the time. It's lightweight and I love being able to adjust the lighting, typeface, and size to suit my needs. The new Paperwhite is also waterproof, which means a little splashing in the garden or pool is no problem.

It's simple to use right out of the box.

When I got my first Kindle, I wasn't sure if I'd use it very often, but now I don't go anywhere without it."
Mare,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the fact that I can now read outside but there are two things I would change. When you touch the screen at all, the pages change. I find myself scrolling back and forth a lot. Also the power is on the bottom, every time I rest it I put it to sleep. Other than those two things, it is life changing. I love it."
Matt,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The power button is right where your pinky holds it up, and you end up turning it off by accident all the time. The light is very blue, no way to switch to night mode, so you end up blinded and blue light is also stimulating, so don't try to read it before you go to bed. Disappointed."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the paper white, perfect size to travel with. My only complaint is that it is a little too sensitive. I have to watch where I put my fingers, or the pages either go backward or forward. But I love the little ebook, love the backlight, can read outside in the bright sunlight, or in the dark without annoying anyone else. I can live with the sensitivity."
LSexton,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I switched from a Samsung tablet nook reader. Other than the learning curve I really like the kindle paper white. I believe it’s easier to read and faster to read. I am still trying to adapt to 3 features —- it’s wider and harder to hold on to, page turning isn’t as easy without the page curl and I would rather the footer read page 100 out of 200 then page 100 50%. Overall I’m very pleased"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ordered this as a Christmas gift for my who does not have access to the Internet...the selling point for me was the description saying that it comes with free cellular....it did not....so will be returning. I did reach out to customer service and was assured it was capable but the about device screen only list WiFi. Not sure what is up with this one.
Pearl Allium,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m so happy I bought this. I wanted to wait a while before reviewing (purchased in January as a bday gift to myself.) I was able to purchase it with ads (they are NOT in your face at all. You see an add for a book or series once upon opening, and that’s it, until you open it again.) and through amazons payment plan, which made it ridiculously affordable for me. I have Kindle Unlimited, and the reading options are almost endless. This is exactly what I needed to get myself out of a rut. And the charge really does last as long as they say. I use it daily, and it’s still over 50% charge after over a week."
AZDaver01,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife after buying one for myself on Black Friday. She loves hers as much as I love mine. Since we are both associated on our Prime account we can read the same books without buying twice if we like. We've taken advantage of reading some books we otherwise would have missed. I recommend this product.
gb,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It works well as an e-reader, but not so great for listening to audiobooks. I ran into issues connecting to a Bluetooth headset. Pairing works fine but once I turn the headset off, the following connection attempts fail. I found a workaround by resetting the Kindle but it's slow and it takes forever. Hopefully, it can be fixed in a software update."
Eunice,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the new Kindle Paperwhite. I got this mostly because of the audible. I did not know rather I would like listening to a book being read, but it fantastic. So will also keep my previous e-reader. I love them both."
KHÖ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Only one star is withheld for little inconvenience with turning pages within library (as I might want to have 50 or more books in the lib. That being said, it is amazing gadget, trust me. Reading the books I love by turning the backlight off while sitting under a natural bright light is such second to none moment of experience of reading ... All new Kindle Paper white is absolutely one of the greatest gifts of modern tech differently compared to other tabs and iPads. I love it."
Tom Reynolds,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle downsized my old Kindle's trade-in value. Not unexpected as they did the same to my first Kindle trade-in.

Was not having trouble with Kindle #2, but thought it was time for upgrading.

If I had known that $5 was the trade-in value allowed, would not have traded-in at this time.

Next time, may look else where or go back to paperbacks.

I can get 10% per book trade-in for those.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to update my kindle and love the new compact size. Very handy to bring when traveling. The only thing I dislike is the placement of the power switch. It is place on the bottom of the kindle and sometimes when it is rested on your lap, it may power your unit off while you are reading. Other than that I love my new kindle and love the built in light."
Shaunna Kay,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used a Nook for years and finally switched over to a kindle this year. So far I love it! The only downside I have found is that it doesn’t show page numbers, it just shows % read. I like to know where I’m at in a book and how kind it is to begin with, so this is frustrating. Oh well- other than that it is fantastic!"
Esche Family,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an old paper white without a light and so I was using my (heavy) iPad to read at night. It's so nice to have an updated paper white with the light. Battery life is excellent. The touch screen is good too. My only ""complaint"" is that it responds a bit slowly so some times I'm not sure it worked. But I'm getting used to it."
Tempus Fugit,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that it's waterproof, but not much else is worth getting a new reader unless yours has finally died, as mine did. My fav Kindle reader was my Voyage. It was the most dimmable and it got really bright, and had the best location for the on/off button.
This new Kindle has issues with it's back light. It never reaches a dim nor a bright light. With the on/off sticking out from the bottom it is always getting bumped while reading. A very poor design feature."
Sophie3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a number of Kindles but had never tried a paperwhite. Got it as a gift for my birthday and I LOVE IT ! It is lightweight, and fits perfectly in my hand, no hand fatigue. Easy to read in the dark and it fits in the smallest purse. I'm not crazy about the set-up of the home page but that is a minor thing for me. Overall, I love this thing."
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"You still need to work on your touchscreen!! When I touch it to go to a previous page, it goes forward, sometimes to 2 pages!! Annoying!!!! It still needs some improvement!!"
Anne,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hoping that the updated version would be faster. It actually is slower. The ability to have a black screen and white print is nice. Otherwise, pretty disappointing upgrade"
Joanne McMaster,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to returned my fourth Kindle because it was so unsatisfactory It frequently did not respond to swipes or taps and would change font size all of a sudden; also would jump to advertising while I was reading. I returned it and replaced it with my current upgraded paperwhite, which is almost as bad!!! I loved my first three Kindles but these last two are awful! Frankly, I would give a NO star rating to them. If my eyesight was better I would return to paper books.

Ace,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my Kindles, this is my 5th one (+ a Fire tablet for browsing). I can’t tell a whole lot of difference between this one and my last one, other than the last one had become less & less responsive over time, and finally ceased to charge. The new one may have some great updated features, but so far I just use it like my old one."
Anthony Simaitis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Kindle. I just love it! After a number of years without a Kindle, there are so many books that I have and will donate them so I can have more space and less clutter."
Frequent Target Shopper,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Buyer Beware. The device comes with kindle unlimited for a period of time that offers some books for free. My daughter likes the device but after the trial period I cancelled Kindle Unlimited. However, the Company still offers the books as 'free' and when your child clicks on them, it reactivates the membership. The representative said that the only way to control this is to ask your child to never click on the free titles. This is impossible. We even have parental controls, but this doesn't affect free books, only pay for books, which evidently doesn't include re-activating a book subscription. This can be very frustrating."
taliaba,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am a person that loves books so I never thought I'd be a Kindle person and I am still getting used to it but I love how long the battery lasts! I tend to read a book a day so you know I use it daily at least 6 hrs each day. The light is not bright enough to hurt my eyes and give me a headache like an iPad would so that's great!
E Siegel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Had a nook for many years and hardly used it because it was bulky and hard to get books. Love my new kindle. It is very compact and lightweight. Print is easy to read and downloading material is a breeze. I can get stuff from the library for free. Have not exposed it to water yet so can't speak to the water proof feature. Battery life is good.
mattwick,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older Kindle Paperwhite that I really liked. This one, meh. The interface is more difficult to navigate, and commonly used features are buried three and four menus deep. Also, the power button is exactly where I put my pinky finger to hold the device, which has caused me to inadvertently turn the device off more than once. Honestly, I'd never not have a Kindle, but this one could have been designed with a little more thought."
Sylvia Harmon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the size of my Paperwhite. It's also very user friendly. The battery life is excellent. I really am not bothered about these two cons, but I wish you could get a good cover for it that's not so expensive. The on and off button on the bottom is a little aggravating because most all stands do not have an opening to accommodate that and the slightest movement while on the stand will turn the unit off."
Cindy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my new Kindle Paperwhite! So lightweight and easily held in one hand. I haven't had a chance to try reading in the sun but I expect it will be perfect! Love that it's waterproof too, as I like to read by the lake or pool when on vacation and I won't have to worry about getting water on it.
As I just received it and started using it, I can't comment on the battery life but I hear it's phenomenal!"
Karen Page,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this exclusively for use at the beach. It is everything I had hoped it would be, no matter how bright it is outside it is so easy to read. So far I have been impressed with the battery life. I read it every day, sometimes for several hours, and so far I have only charged it twice in the month I have had it. I am now also using it for my reading at home rather than my tablet. It is very light and portable. I am very happy with this purchase."
K. Todd Ledford,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd Kindle and I must say the ""Paperwhite"" really does make a difference in the ease of being able to see and read what's on the screen. A small size device but you can adjust the font size and even with my not so perfect eyesight I see the screen with no problem. Just a very good basic reading device and being able to download almost any book without leaving your house is perfect. Looking forward to having this for a long time to come."
Lee Husemann,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a Kindle Fire HD and I love it, but I love the Paperwhite because it is so compact it fits in my purse or a pocket. This is actually my second Paperwhite. You never can have too many Kindles!"
Jacquie M Knight,5.0 out of 5 stars,Overall a good product. Functions as advertised. I’m using this for travel to cut down on weight and space in my luggage. The touch screen is a bit annoying; it seems like there’s a longer delay in response than I expect. I end up going too far back or forward or somewhere I don’t mean to go because it doesn’t respond and I tap the screen again. I guess it’s not as responsive as my iPhone that I’m used to.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband surprised me with this Kindle for Valentines Day this year. I love the portability of the Kindle!! I find that it is perfect for reading at night before I go to sleep. The ability to set the brightness is helpful so that it doesn't keep my hubbie awake as I read. Love that I can adjust the font size as well. The storage capability of this model is fantastic. I would highly recommend this!
Franci,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Adjustable back light and fonts make for easy reading in all conditions. Lightweight, easy to carry even in a jacket pocket. I gave this 4 stars because I'm not crazy about the touchscreen and searches.
The 'home page' for the store is difficult to read when looking at books. I find it annoying. Perhaps I just have not found the proper settings for that area. I am new to this kindle, paperwhite. I had a much earlier kindle.
I'm still on the learning curve myself, but I do enjoy and use it often."
East Coast Lady,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband had an old kindle and one of his gripes was that it was bright when he read at bedtime. The new Kindle Paperwhite solves the problem. He can set it black with white lettering to read in bed. He feels it helps him get to sleep because he does not have the white lit screen in front of him and it has worked for him.
Mike,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded a 4th gen Kindle, purchased in 2011.....it was running perfectly, however, I read at night and it was a struggle to read with the poor lighting in my room. I hate to replace something that is working well, but finally I upgraded.
Paperwhite is wonderful...it is comfortable, great adjustable lighting, easily read. Well worth the cost."
Vince,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a first generation Oasis, and saw the Paperwhite at a special Prime only offer so I bought it. Turns out I had to return it since its clarity just can't compare to the Oasis. It is a good buy with water-proof and extra storage and if you DON'T have the Oasis I would said go for all it since it is selling for a lot less."
frugal athlete,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first kindle, but I really love that I can use this in the dark and total sunlight. The touchscreen is a little delayed, but it’s not hard to get used to. I signed into my local library with my amazon account, and now I can download books directly to the device. It’s amazing and now I don’t need to worry about library fines!"
Escuela,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the size and weight.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Never been a big reader but i’ve always wanted to get into reading. Since I live at home with 2 other people, Most of the time I get distracted when i’m trying to read a physical book during the day. But ever since I got this Kindle, I now read for about 30 minutes to and hour every night when it’s peaceful and quiet. Now i’m able to get all the knowledge I wanted from books by reading every night. I also prefer Kindle because I have limited amount of space in my apartment to have books. And my last point, Kindle books are cheaper than paperback books and can save you money in the long run. Helps me fall asleep as well everytime I read at night with the kindle. Do yourself or someone you love a favor and get a Kindle."
Penny D. Salley,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I feel the touch screen is too sensitive and the battery life isn't any better than my old one that finally gave out. I also can't find my list of books without seeing the pictures of the books, and those are small and sometimes hard to read."
ncuser,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this thinking it would be an upgrade from my 4+ year old Voyage Kindle. Upon receiving it, I matched the settings and compared the same page in the same book on both devices. The older device screen was by far clearer text and higher quality in feel and look. No setting adjustments caused the newer device to look better than the old one. Customer service was not helpful and basically said yes, the older device was better. Shocking and disappointed. This brand new device will be returned."
Thomas Daue,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitating to give up my 4th Gen Kindle because the touchscreen and handling of Gen 7 did not look so much better in the past. But the Gen 10 Paperwhite convinced me:
- Backlit, excellent and sharp display, you can read now anywhere without lights, especially when travelling,
- much better battery live time,
- intuitive user interface,
- lighter and water proof.
Highly satisfied and would recommend the new Gen 10 paperwhite."
strega711,5.0 out of 5 stars,if you are a reader. you need this. I thought I was not going to use another gadget but I do not leave home without my kindle and my cell. It is small enough that it fits in my packets of jeans.
Tony Zee,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot download to this new Kindle Paperwhite.
I sent one new Paperwhite back and tried a second new Paperwhite.

I have spent hours on the phone with Amazon Paperwhite technical support.
The new Kindle Paperwhite will not download for me.
After many hours, it has only downloaded one book.
Maybe some day, but I will be sending the second Paperwhite back soon."
JT,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're thinking about buying this, just pull the trigger and buy it. You won't regret it, I can't seem to set the thing down. I purchased it with the hopes that I'd start reading more often. I've read several books in just the few months I've owned it, more than I've read since, well, ever. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to read more but doesn't have the storage space for books or the dexterity to read large, cumbersome books while in bed."
MusicTech,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am sure the waterproof feature is cool (though it is hard to tell if would be comfortable reading while lying on a floaty in the pool or at the beach).
My gripe is that now, as opposed to the old one, when I turn it on, there is a message saying it is starting up. I know it is only a second or so but it is still annoying - I preferred the old, faster startup"
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,THIS IS MY FIFTH KINDLE AND I CAN'T BELIEVE IT IS EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE. HAD I NOT LOST MY PREVIOUS PAPERWHITE I WOULD NEVER HAVE BOUGHT THE NEW ONE. AMAZON ALWAYS DELIVERS A QUALITY PRODUCT. THE PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE AND WITHIN MINUETS I WAS UP AND RUNNING WITH ALL MY CONTENT AVAILABLE TO DOWNLOAD FROM THE CLOUD WITH EVEN MY DIRECTORIES IN PLACE(A BIG IMPROVEMENT WITH THE DIRECTORIES IN THE CLOUD)
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I know this device has more memory and is lighter, but I liked the old one better. The new one is slower to turn on (because it has to wake up), and the surface is more slippery. There's no definition between the screen and the border where one holds it. My thumb keeps sliding and I turn a page (or 2 or 3).
I would also help if the power button was not on the bottom.
New and Improved is not always better."
Raul Oscar Arteaga,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is an upgrade on my ancient (but still in working order) 2nd Gen Kindle. At first, I was not that sure to upgrade, as I loved my physical keys to change pages with one hand but the touchscreen works great for it. Obviously, my go-to this model was the backlight which is even, smooth and a real improvement over my son's early paperwhite. I love it."
Josh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was not sure if i would like digital reading, but it's very easy on the eyes. I can read at night with my wife and it does not disturb her because i don't need to keep the light on. It good all my digital books and easily allows me to check books out from my local library. I recommend this to everyone. I still highlight and take notes all without the weight of carrying multiple books around in my backpack. Waterproof! I take this backpacking with me as well and don't have to worry about it. I Highly recommend to everyone interested in reading more with less weight!"
Laura E.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually returned this Kindle because it only allowed Bluetooth connections. I like the option of having a wired Jack port, the ability of yext-to-speech and the ability to enlarge the font on all screens including the home screen. I didn't want to have to have 2 pairs of Bluetooth rosebuds. I also have very bad eye sight and dyslexia so having larger font and text-to-speech helps me with reason. This Paper White Kindle was not for me. I returned it and bought an Fire Tablet 8 which accommodated my needs. Plus... It was less expensive. It really is to be used for my books but now I have the option to view my Prime Videos, Netflix, and music apps."
SueL,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have decided that my old Kindle Paperwhite held the charge longer than the new and improved paperwhite Kindle. I wish I had not updated my kindle and I cannot contact Amazon to let them know. They just tell me that my return window is closed, even though in the same area they have product support which you cannot get to. So, If you have an older Kindle Paperwhite, hang on to it as long as it is working."
Hernandez,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product that loses a star because of a frustrating design choice. For some reason the engineering team chose to place the off button on the bottom of the device, where your pinkie finger naturally holds it in place while reading. As such, often you’ll be engrossed in a passage when the machine powers down because your pinkie inadvertently touched the raised button. If not for that, five star product."
Celeste St. Martin,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This kindle is not as user friendly as the Fire. I have both now and find the Kindle Fire much easier to use. The screen on the paper white is not as responsive as the screen on the Fire. It is harder to find where things are...this may resolve upon further use. The paper white is smaller and lighter, but the Fire is not large or heavy. I still prefer my older Kindle Fire."
Reverie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I guess I'm kind of old school....... I love the new system and the capacity that it has ......the backlight is excellent........ I just wish I was able to see the new books I purchase at the top, along with being able to store all the other books and their categories or files........ I guess I'm kind of used to the old school Kindle"
Manoj Kumar Ravi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always wanted to read book but was just to lazy to carry the big novels around. This solved all the problems that i had with reading. No heavy weight, One device with multiple books, Screen that resembles a paper, Great batter life, Water resistant. One of the best investments I have made that helped me develop the habit of reading!"
Amanda Scheel,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give thus 4.5. I love the new features.

The only problem I have is the battery life. Its good but nowhere near the life of the previous version. Even with everything turned off and the brightness off or low.

Otherwise a fantastic product and I love it lots!"
Amazon Prime member,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked the small form factor and light weight kindle. After 8+ months of very light usage, it doesn’t turn ON anymore. It shows battery symbol with an exclamation mark which means the battery is dead already!

I’ve so many other devices (iPads and iPhone) which are 6+ years old and their battery still works. This probably means very poor quality of battery in the kindle paper white..
Essentially the kindle paperWhite has sort of become “paper weight”."
Dina K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love amazon and this was a steal on blackfriday deals.I got 3 ,1 for me and 2 for kids for xmas (i had some shipment issue but amazon was helpful).I strongly recommend."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally did the trade-in offer on my old one and I'm so happy I did. The backlighting on the Paperwhite is wonderful and easy to adjust. I like the fact that it's waterproof but I haven't tested that out yet. Best yet, I can pair a set of wireless headphones and also listen to my Audible purchases through my Kindle. Very happy with this version of the Kindle."
Mike McCain,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The unit is slow to respond to input. Definitely a l aggy product. I've read online of many people with similar issues, and tried the ""fixes"". I'm used to using my kindle app on my phone to read, but wanted a dedicated device for this since I'm an avid reader. Perhaps I've been spoiled by my phone, or expected too much from the device. It has some definite pros like size and ease on the eyes, but overall I'm just disappointed with the responsiveness of the unit."
L,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle Paperwhite because it fits in my purse and I can take it everywhere. I can read it at night without disturbing my husband. I know everyone has been talking about the ads, ( special offers) but you don’t even notice them as they are very small at the bottom. They don’t bother messing up your reading at all."
Lynda A,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As far as the paper white goes, it is great for reading. I was very unhappy with the fact that the charger that came with the device did not work. I called customer service and they issued me a $15 credit but when I went online to order a new one, they were out of stock. That is why I gave three stars. I received this a Christmas gift from my daughter and she bought a paper white also and her charger worked."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a pretty, excellent size, but I did not find any written instructions with the Kindle. Eventually got into the system but have no idea what I am doing -- probably because I am not well versed in technology, but wanted the kindle so I could get rid of a lot of paper. The instructions, I discovered, are on the system, but I can't go back and forth and understand how to operate the system. I prefer to study a paper version of the User/Operator Manual and highlight certain operating procedures before I plug the product into a electric circuit. I've never ordered a technology product that did not produce an operators manual of some type. At the rate I'm going, will never get what I wanted out of the Kindle."
Margaret D. Diamond,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I sent it back. It is not user friendly....I have been a Kindle user for years and this is the first one to aggravate me....I wanted paper white for when I would be reading out doors, as soon as it was connected my Fire quit. This infuriated me, plus the black and white only felt like backward sophistication. I sent it back."
John Bebout,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What a wonderful product. I've been wanting one for years and with my grandkids getting into reading I decided to go for it. My adult daughter loves it, for herself and for reading books to her children. The quality and functionality is fabulous. I was so much impressed that I ordered one for myself tonight. Can't wait until it arrives, I'll buy a dozen ebooks on day one!"
Melissa L.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely an improvement over earlier versions. The backlight feature allows you to read in the dark or on airplanes without turning on overheads but is also soft enough that you won’t wake your bedmate. Small and lightweight for easy portability. My only gripe is whoever designed this really needs to rethink where the power button goes. Putting it on the bottom of the device is legitimately the worst user experience. If you are holding this, propping it, or generally resting it on a surface the probability of you hitting the power button in the process is 50/50. Can we go back to putting the power button on the top of the device please?"
K. Zilles,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is easier on the eyes than reading on a tablet. I'd be much more willing to bring it to the beach. The backlighting is perfect. It's super lightweight and fits in a purse. The ink updates faster than it did on the first generation Kindle I used to have. Scrolling interfaces still look bad, but just page turning is fine.

Very happy with my purchase."
broadwayfan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Kindle on Prime Day as a replacement for my year-old prior generation Kindle. While it added Audible and waterproof to the feature list, there are other changes I dislike. First is that the backlighting doesn't turn down as far as it used to - I like it VERY low when I am reading in bed but can't get it as low as my old Kindle. Related to that, when the Kindle comes on, it doesn't come on using the current setting - it is much brighter while ""waking up"" (another change) and is a bit jarring in a completely dark room. The second change is that it takes much longer to connect to wifi than it used to, so syncing to the most recent page read can take upwards of a minute. I don't know about battery life yet - it always seems to be short in the first few days, but then improves after that."
Grace,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great Kindle, similar to the models before it. The screen is a little better than its predecessors and the surface of the screen is flush with the edges. I’m not as worried about causing pressure damage to the screen on this one as I was with the old one, as in what happened to a magnadoodle when you pressed too hard in one place. The one caveat is that it doesn’t come in white. Why Amazon? Why?"
P Parmley,5.0 out of 5 stars,My very old kindle was still working just fine but I decided to give in to my desires and bought this beauty. I have no regrets. It is so much lighter than my old kindle. Page turning is now a breeze. I am able to read it in any light. I am in love.
jver,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loving this for far. I don’t know why everyone is complaining about the battery life, unless you have 500 books downloaded on the Kindle it should do just fine. I downloaded one and the battery goes down every hour and a half and that’s all I read so far. I simply close the case, reopen it and it’s fine. The Kindle is very light weight and fits in my hand perfectly, and my travel bags. PS get the red case it’s amazing. The Fire 8 did no good for me. It’s tall, and it fit into my hand poorly. This does the trick. Great purchase."
Sisa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The is my second e-reader and I can honestly say that it is beyond better than my ancient Nook Simple Touch. Because I read at night with the company of my sleeping baby nearby, I have to read under the blanket so as to prevent the little human from waking from her glorious beauty sleep. Why, because the lowest brightness setting is a tad bit too bright but it's doable as long as I am draped over. I also love the fact that I can connect with Goodreads and submit my own personal rating of each reading material."
Twistergrl89,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My kindle is amazing! I love it! The text is clear and has an option for inverted text, which is great for late night reading when my husband wants to go to sleep. I do a lot of notes while I am reading and the keypad and screen are not very sensitive, which is why I give it 3 stars. As for swiping to turn the page, it does pretty well though. I have significantly read more since I received the kindle than when I read from the app on my phone. Even though I havent used it yet, I love that there is a speed reading option. Excellent gift!"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,1. (Ordering) First of all. Amazon needs to not list Cellular in the tech specs of the non cellular version of the paperwhite. They used to have the option to pick cellular in a drop down in prior versions but it isn’t there on this version. Instead it’s a different page of the site. When I saw cellular listed in the tech specs I thought I had the right version. 2. (The product) This my fourth kindle. I’ve loved each one. I went for this because I liked the idea of waterproof. I read at the bus stop and sometimes it rains. I thought this would address concerns I had with the old paperwhite getting wet. However there is a big trade off. The non-recessed screen makes it really easy to accidentally flip through multiple pages. No matter how I hold it happens and I have small really hands.
G. Novak,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands down the slowest Kindle yet. Between opening the cover to wake it up then waiting for a new book(s) to download (I have fast wi-fi) to tapping on virtually anything on the screen this thing is the worst. This is my 6th or 7th Kindle edition and am overall saddened. Restarting device does nothing but delay my reading. Maybe in the 11th version they will improve speed. Update 4-24-2019: STILL the slowest Kindle yet, thought paying to remove adds Might speed up loading...not so much."
Jack,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first e-reader and I have fallen in love with it so far. The paper-white screen has no glare and is super easy to read in the sun or dark. This device is extremely light and easy to hold. I bought a case just to give it a little more weight in my hand.
The only down side to the kindle paper white is the battery life. If airplane mode is on then it will last for weeks at a time on a single charge but once the wifi turns on the battery will start to tick down at a much higher rate."
Gary Schmeling,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I replaced my Paperwhite with the new version. I was annoyed by the delay in startup time. I did some research and there was luckily a way to turn off this new power saving feature. I'm not clear why it is turned on by default. The Paperwhite has great battery performance without this added gimmick. At least don't enable it by default. Silly feature that adds no value. Also really surprising, but I miss the slightly recessed screen on the prior version. This screen is flush with the bezel, which I thought would be great, but realize now that the slight depression on the older version is what I would catch on with my fingers to slide the kindle off my nightstand. It is now harder to grab your Kindle due to the smooth surface. It is nice that it no longer catches lint, crumbs, etc--but I miss the lip!"
Sylvia T. Owen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this Kindle. I replaced a previous Kindle that had too little storage, 2 GB. My new one has 32 GB, and I am loading up with more books. I can't help myself. It is comfortable for reading, my previous one was heavier. It responds more quickly when I turn it on and start it up. One minor downside is when I read my Bible, it slows down when I first start, and then it turns the pages at the proper pace. I am still figuring out the vocabulary builder. It seems a bit more complicated than my previous Kindle. Overall, I am really happy with it."
Jasmine Necaise,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had a kindle for YEARS but unfortunately my old one just wasn't cutting it anymore. The battery died too quick and took so long to charge. I recieved this one for my birthday and I am in love. I love that I can still read outside and the battery lasts forever! I just wish you didnt have to have adds as a screensaver.
anyomous,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really nice, lightweight, easy to carry in small/medium size purse. A little slow in changing pages but easy to read & use. Like others, I found the bottom button sometimes annoying when accidental bumping shut device. Also since it runs Amazon's proprietary operating system it only downloads Kindle app books from the library"
E.D.Z.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like that the book is there waiting for me. That was a problem with the Fire. I like that I can read it with either white or black background. One problem is that sometimes when I want to go back a page, it jumps forward a page. Also, I have not figured out if I can make the page smaller so I can push backward or forward many pages at a time."
Bwill,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the original Kindle Paperwhite and LOVED it. It was time for a new one, so I ordered the new Paperwhite. It's AWFUL!!! Going back!! So much glare, I literally can't even see the screen. Not even from sunlight, even inside. What the heck, the whole point of the Paperwhite is no glare and that it's like a book. I've never hated anything so much. I'm returning it and ordering the old version!"
Karen Padgett,4.0 out of 5 stars,Was excited to get a Kindle for the battery life and the lower light on the reader. I find it challenging to navigate to find my books as there is so much advertising/upselling more books every time I turn it on. I don't think it is as easy to read as the iPad but will defer final judgement until I am somewhere where it is sunny and my iPad really doesn't work.
Ci Li,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love reading on my Paperwhite. The screen is responsive, and there is little to no glare. The only drawbacks for me are the lack of a sepia tone and the power button being on the bottom. I often hold it from the bottom with one hand, as I would a book of the same size, and I’m always turning it off by accident. It doesn’t take much pressure to hit the power button, and that can make it hard to prop it up or hold one handed."
Strib,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love my new Kindle Paperwhite. My only wish is that it would rotate like my old on did. The drop down menu is not the easiest to navigate. The pages are very easy to read and the size is nice. I would recommend this to anyone.
Claire Sivertsen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I sure love my First New Kindle!!! I love being able to read without reading books, either paperbacks or hard cover. My Kindle Paperwhite is a great buy if you love to read!! And I do love to read, usually up to 9 hours a day! That's what I did with my first new Kindle these last 2 weeks!!! YEP, I sure do enjoy my Kindle."
C. Farris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the convenience of my Paperwhite, although I somewhat miss the tablet aspects of my old Fire. For reading, this is far superior. I read in bed a lot, so handling page turning is a breeze and it's a lot lighter than even a paperback. Super convenient for vacation travel too. No worries that my battery will go dead in the middle of a flight."
John Frickstad,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm still getting used to mine. I'm a real book person, and resisted these things for years. I received the Paperweight as a gift and found it to be very convenient to carry and read anywhere in doors. I haven't seen any pictures on this, and hope its just the book. I read books with pictures and maps and wonder how easy it will be to reference them during a read. I'm not completely sold on these, but warming up to them."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Disclaimer...This is my first kindle. I got this one because the app on my phone was bothering my eyes. I bought the paperwhite for the waterproofing. My husband and I camp and it only makes sense to have the extra protection. I'm still trying to navigate the shopping on kindle. I mastered prime library though.

The paperwhite is great. I've used the bright and dark background and like both. The touch screen is sensitive. Once I read the manual (or scanned for pieces) I had no more issues. The battery is being charged for the first time now. I've had it a week and read several novels. I dont intend to test the waterproofing, I'll post if nature tests it for me."
CMN,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new Kindle Paper White. I was still using one of the original Kindles (which worked fine...but I wanted the ""paper white"" background. The only ""negative"" is that it's so small and slim, it's easy to misplace. So I have to make sure I pay closer attention to when and where I put it down! But, it fits nicely in my purse, so I can take it with me everywhere."
SixtyFour,4.0 out of 5 stars,Smaller than we expected but since our kindle keyboard finally died we had little choice but to ‘upgrade’. The few simple games on the kindle keyboard were easier and more fun to play but from a pure book reading point of view this paper white is better. We bought a simple stand up case to go with it and are happy with it.
Gozamomm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my new paperwhite. I had an old one for years but it got caught in a wave at the beach and died. It was great but this one is even better. I love the blue back. I love that the entire screen is flat, no frame at all. The screen is very responsive and fast. The battery life is good as well. I love that it’s waterproof as I can take it places and not worry if it gets wet. Best kindle yet by far."
CURMUDGEON,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Much improved over earlier models, but would like to be able to elect white print on black background for greater contrast due to visual problem. I feel certain that many others with vision impairment would also benefit with this option. This would not effect use by standard population; there are literally millions of vision-impaired people who could benefit by such an option availability."
Bubble,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This isn't a bad kindle, so dont let the reviews tell you otherwise. I was upgrading from a 2015 paperwhite, and imo it was worth it my old kindle was sluggish, the light wasnt working as well, and the battery life was half the original battery life of the device. If you're upgrading from a 4-5 year old kindle, it's worth it. Battery life is fine as long as you keep airplane mode on. No dead pixels or uneven light on this model for me. It did do one weird thing where it wouldn't fully refresh the screen but a hard restart did the trick and it never did it again. Very happy and hope that this lasts as long as my last one."
Bricedude,4.0 out of 5 stars,A very nice upgrade from my original kindle that was 7 years old. It still lags really bad when highlighting and using a few other features. I know e-ink displays aren’t know for their responsiveness but this is pretty bad. I could be wrong but I feel like my old kindle could highlight faster. Overall it’s a great upgrade. The backlight performs exactly like I was hoping. Now I don’t have to huddle next to a lamp like an old gameboy.
Edward Slothrop,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased for a Christmas present for my wife. She was very excited when she opened it, but this quickly wore off because it seems to be bricked... Power button did nothing. Researched online -- tried holding power button for >40 seconds and all other tricks I could find to no avail. Almost thought I had it then it produced the image above... Called customer service hoping I could go pick up another one at a nearby Amazon store, but was told no. Got an email that says I have to send this one in and then they will get me a new in 5 days. Merry Christmas? Kept trying to get it to work including letting it charge for hours -- but now it won't connect perhaps because Amazon put this serial number on a blacklist until they get it back? Ugh."
curly&moe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this for a friend. She likes to read when in the swimming pool, lake, etc. She promptly submerged the Kindle. Caught it about 2' deep, but it still works flawlessly. Since I've never used, it, I can't comment otherwise."
Robert A. Erlandson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"While I remain a devotee of real books, I love this Kindle for its convenience and portability. I can carry a whole library in my pocket. I bought one without adjustable light first but quickly returned it; it was not bright enough for my aged eyes. But the paperwhite model with adjustable light, fonts, type size and boldness is my new BFF."
D,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had the new Kindle Paperwhite for a few weeks. The battery life is great. I was reading in the bright sunlight by the pool and there was no glare. It was fantastic reading in the middle of the day. It has also been great to read in the dark. The light is great and gives an even shine over the whole screen. This is my third Kindle, and it is my favorite."
Whatshernamit,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve loved the Kindle paper White so far. I do wish the touch screen was a bit more responsive and the pages turned faster. Also think it could use buttons on side edges just in case your holding in one hand and don’t want to touch the screen to turn pages. But it’s durable, the right size for my hand bag and a really great price!"
Michael Sr.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have just received my 10th generation Kindle - in my opinion, for a pure reading device, there is no comparison. Sleek, compact, all new features are just terrific. ""Behind the scenes"" the whole Amazon/Kindle business model is so well thought out and presented - for the serious reader, this device is incredible - I don't go anywhere without it! Lastly, for $99.???? absolutely amazing!"
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"in terms of reading experience, it is perfect. Since I have been doing my readings so far on tablets, the technology of e-ink and e-readers is still not up to comparison. however, the ease of use, battery life and above all the comfort of reading without the screen glaring back is a huge advantage."
Diana_drd,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I broke my wrist and suddenly my original Kindle made reading a chore. I just could not turn the page without 6 or more attempts. The Paperwhite pages turn with just a tap. Just close the book - the cover, sold separately - and it turns off. Open the book and swipe and start reading. There are lots of other features I haven't explored yet. One thing to improve - not a Kindle thing - resetting my password was a big pain as there was some kind of bug in the auto system and I found myself on an endless loop.Eventually landed out of it so I could proceed with setting my new Kindle up."
Deborah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Paperwhite Kindle & my first of this model. I love it! The battery lasts quite a bit longer than the previous model I had. The touch screen is very sensitive. It is a tad slow to turn on when I open the case I purchased, but that is a very minor complaint & really does not affect my five star rating."
S. Dahl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As the user of one of the very first Kindles (yes, the one with the buttons) for a number of years, I initially found this paper white version to require a bit of a learning curve, but the features are worth it: the back-lighting, the audio, the storage, and the infinite variety of downloads and capacities. Am very pleased -- even if I am still learning."
Austin Reeves,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product for reading on the go or just keeping your entire library in one place. It's helped me get back into the habit of reading a lot more often! The touch screen works just fine but it definitely runs a little slowly in the menus. When reading, however, everything works wonderfully! You can easily see the screen in bright daylight or in total darkness which is such a plus for me. Also ebooks are a lot nicer on your bank account. Highly recommend!"
Brian Moon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"i cant read books online in normal ways like through a computer or tablet due to eye issues.. and regular books while i do enjoy physical ones, they are big, bulky and expensive. In the 2 months ive owned my kindle, i've read about 20 books so far. Its so much easier on my eyes, and lets me be more relaxed and comfortable cause i can get into positions that dont hurt while reading now."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the screen features and the battery life is better, at least compared to the Fire this is replacing. My primary complaint is that doing anything other than reading is slower than Christmas. I know it's a reader and it's good for that but it takes far too long to wake up. I'm guessing that's part of how hey extended the battery life but I'd like to have the option for a fast start and lower battery life since I'm generally close to power."
terralee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like a paperback only better, great battery life, easy to read, and compact.
This is literally the size of an average size paperback, only not nearly as thick. Reading this you feel like you are actually looking at a paper page. No glare, no strain on the eyes. The battery is phenomenal, long lasting and quick to charge."
FRANK H DRIES III,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love reading on the Light-Weight Kindle Paperwhite. Like that it is waterproof and mostly anti-glare for reading outside. I have an Apple iPad Pro which is use for research and browsing. However for reading I prefer this small Kindle and like that there are not other distractions from my reading. I do wish the user interface and touch screen were a bit more response—it is sluggish compared to all my other devices (although they are 7-10x as expensive too).
japanic,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I lost my Kindle Paperwhite 3 so I got this one. When I opened the glove compartment to store the 4th Kindle Paperwhite I found it there lol. Guess I have two but I'm happy I can compare. I'm not sure about the battery issues yet but the blacks aren't as deep when the front light is on which makes me have to squint. It also feels a bit heavier than the last gen but I'm not sure if that's the case. The screen and bezels are a fingerprint magnet. I think lookwise and waterproofing it's better than last generation but other than that, not really. Not sure if it was worth it just yet but at least it looks nice in it's case"
penile,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've seriously had this thing sitting on my nightstand collecting dust for months (I do read every once in a while) and the battery is just fine. I will say, I thought the backlight was going to be an issue for me because I thought it might negate the whole purpose of having a paper screen, but it's actually not too harsh and allows you to read in the dark without keeping you awake too long."
"Bibi Reads, A LOT",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace an earlier version Paperwhite that I lost. Overall, I like it. It's sleek and lightweight, and I kinda like the not really an edge black edge that's now part of the screen.

Having said that... This one LOSES ITS CHARGE a LOT faster than the earlier version of the paperwhite. If you don't put it in airplane mode, expect it to be dead every morning. Kind of annoying..."
nantom,5.0 out of 5 stars,My old kindle died while traveling so I rushed out and got a new one. The new one does work a little better and internet stuff likebuying another book or definitions works great. Haven’t had to check waterproofing yet.
J of JSg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love how crisp the letters are on e-ink connoisseur to LCD. I wanted a device that made reading a pleasurable experience and the paperwhite makes it happen. No distractions that take away your attention.

The device is small enough to carry around but not so small you have a small reading area.

Has I realized how much I would have the paperwhite, I would have gotten one sooner."
Ronald L Hanks,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first kindle was old school for sure. It has a qwerty keyboard and forward and back buttons on the sides. When I started using my new Paperwhite it was hard not to press to turn the pages, which the buttons are no loner there. I also don't have to have a light on nearby so that I can read. It's lightweight, compact and fun to use. I will be using this a lot in my retirement years."
Alex Gariepy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is great, I think the only downside is I purchased the one with the book ads when you turn the screen off. I don’t like that and I don’t think there is a way to pay to get rid of them now. It’s honestly worth the extra money to not have those ads. But otherwise it’s lightweight and amazing. Touch screen is not going to be up to par with Apple or other tech but keep in mind we aren’t buying this for tablet functions, just for reading. And for that reason this thing knocked it out of the park for me. It easy to figure out and great for reading. Great item for frequent readers, makes a great gift too. It feels nice in the hand, easy on the eyes and you can customize it to fit how you want to read."
Alexandra Pilarski,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a voracious reader and I have avoided getting an e-reader because I love the feel of a book in my hand. However, with a long, long road trip to my in-laws for the holidays, I decided to give it a shot. Not only am I thrilled with the specs, I am reading more than ever (much to my partner's chagrin since I stop listening :) and I am so happy. The lighting is perfect and doesn't bother my eyes at all, and that is saying something (hyper-sensitive vision). I especially love that this is ONLY books. No games, no social media, no food delivery, and it really allows me to relax finally. I am getting lost in the stories like I used to when I was younger, but without the bulk! It will never replace real books, but it certainly has it's perks."
"Perry B. Alers, aka peebee",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like: the quick warmup, and generally rapid response;
Don""t like: the generally klunky way one has to backtrack into a text; ""Go To"" seems a clumsy procedure, with iffy results.
Otherwise, all is tranquil. A little surprised my last model didn't last longer. Only a few months beyond a year, but I admit I'm a hard rider."
I. Burcham,3.0 out of 5 stars,"With my other two kindles I just have to close the cover to turn it off, and then to turn it on all I do is swipe. This new kindle might be fancier is some way, but it turns off after a fashion, and to turn it on I have to press the button at the bottom to Wake It Up. Then once it wakes up I have to swipe it. Too much extra stuff to do, and I think it is going to use up the battery faster."
Oregon buyer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Kindle in March. By June it was not holding a charge. it was sent to a repair shop and returned to me a week later with assurances that it was fine. Now, two months later, it won't hold a charge for even a 24 hour period. I did buy another one this week because I'm leaving on vacation and need one that will stay charged and my books are all on Amazon. Otherwise, I would be searching for an alternative."
who-me,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Price was $129.00 plus tax and I've had it for 3 months and it just stopped working. This is my 3rd Kindle and my 2 previous ones each lasted over a year.
It was a lot of money to waste. I am extremely upset. I have no money and NO KIndle. Can anyone out there help me?"
Tiago Dá Mesquita,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a Kindle Paperwhite for my wife and another for myself, and I haven’t parted with mine since it arrived. In less than 2 months, I have started and finished reading 5 books and I am currently reading 3 more.
The reading experience is great, and it still amazes me how similar to a paper book the screen looks, especially when I read outdoors.
I was not expecting a blazing fast device for the price, but perhaps my biggest regret is the speed of writing. I tend to highlight a lot of passages and write notes about them, and the virtual keyboard is simply too unresponsive if you try to write even moderately fast. It actually forces you to write very slowly, and it is prone to digitation errors, which forces you to go back and correct them, thereby losing more time."
Teresa Barnette,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Why do you get a device without any instructions nor a users guide. This was so different from my previous Kindle. I spent more time than I should have looking up just where the home, and my books were. I have had this for a few weeks now, and still have trouble getting my new books. Next time a little help - Kindle, please."
Jenniffer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm giving this a 5 star because it's, honestly a really good device! I got it for Christmas and it was easy to set up, there is no glare, and the battery life is crazy! I fully charged it on Christmas and haven't charged it since. I read for at least 4-5 hours a day and it still hasn't died yet. The only set back is that when you try to scroll on it, it doesn't really scroll, it just jumps from one thing to another which is rather annoying. All-in-all it's a 5 star!"
Faith Shaw,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought I would not like the size compared to my Nook but it’s a great size for holding in one hand while I have my coffee or tea and small enough I can turn the page with that one hand.

I love the smooth front compared to my old Kindle. I have not been able to stop reading since I got it. The biggest love is the front light. My eyes would strain reading on my Nook and that is not the case with my new Kindle Paperwhite"
CatsCritique,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In fact, it is so streamlined, even with the Kindle tucked into the protective cover, it is still very light and easy to handle. I am definitely enjoying reading more.
Easy page-turning by touching the right or left side of the screen. The built-in light is a great help as is the no-glare screen. I really did notice the battery life is much longer too."
jeschrumpf,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I hadn't had a Kindle reader before so I decided to try the brand new Paperwhite they all raved about. It's tiny. Squinty tiny. And very dim. I have it up all the way and it's very very dim. I don't read in bed or under water so most of the big ""extras"" meant nothing to me. I wanted a nice size reader that I could read. This isn't it. And then they dropped the price $30 and I really felt ripped off. I hate myself for buying it."
CrazyCarl,4.0 out of 5 stars,Size and weight are great. I run it white letters on dark background and the contrast is poor with a shade of charcoal at darkest. Can’t adjust it any better. That is my only disappointment but IF you run in dark mode it is a significant concern. Probably a screen function and not just a firmware issue. I’d hope they can fix this but I doubt it. Again I am happy except this one feature.
norma,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It makes little sense to have large print pages when the book titles are so small that it defeats its purpose. The Kindle makes reading possible for poor sighted people like me. Now will someone find a way to make the titles LARGER or have I missed something. The built in light causes black areas in my sight after turning it off. I know. That is my problem. All else said, I like the Kindle."
AmazonSmile Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought it on Black Friday sales. It’s worthy!
It doesn’t provide any unnecessary features that distract you from reading. As a famous and successful kindle product, I couldn’t find a word to diss it. Oh, the touch screen isn’t fast responsive enough, I mistyped for a few times.
The true problem I have is, for users don’t have the habit to read books like me, it is no more than an expensive digital stationary.;)"
Tiffany Stewart,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second E-Reader, so I am still relatively new to the experience. This E-Reader has well exceeded my expectations. I have had it for around 2 weeks and though I have not been able to read a ton just yet, it has set on my nightstand for the entire duration and it still has over 40 percent battery life left. I am very pleased with the overall design and the back light as well. I have not tested the waterproof functionality as I am a mom of 2 young children. I have to rush my baths and therefore do not have the opportunity to read in the bathtub much. If you are looking for an e-reader with great battery life as well as a sleek design, this is definitely it."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the waterproof feature since I enjoy being outside by a pool or relaxing on the beach. I don't have to worry about splashing. What I didn't like was having my Trade-In rejected as having a cracked screen. It didn't and it was well protected in the box for shipping. I used the box I received the new one in. I complained to Amazon and finally they credited my purchase with the promised $25.00.
Keith Gilbert,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle and second Paperwhite. I read a lot and this e-reader suits me perfectly with its long battery life, variable light brightness and text size. The new operating system is a great improvement from the first generation and allows me to easily categorize my library and mark books as read etc. I have the model with ads...always have...and it's no bother at all. A great bullet proof advice. (Both my previous devices are still operating and being used by family)"
Telma,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly this device leaves much to be desired .. I feel with a device of the 90's ..So, this is my second experience with the Kindle. I do not indicate I bought kindle for the convenience of having several books on one set. But it is a device that hangs, does not respond to your commands, you try to underline a text does not underline, you try to change the page does not change, you try to unlock the device it does not unlock, the proposed idea is wonderful, but the device itself leaves much to be desired. I had bought a device and returned it believing it was device failure, but it was not ... the Kindle for mobile app works much better than the Kindle device. Unfortunately I will be returning the device due to lack of functionality. The impression I have is that its processor is very slow."
tomherlein,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am 70 years old, and have an incurable disease which can lead to extreme weakness in my arms, legs and eyes. Due to those problems I have lots of medical appointments which lead to lots of waiting. My Kindle Paperwhite is so great because it is small and light. I used to read books, but they were often a hassle because of size and weight, and not waterproof. Now I use my Kindle Paperwhite and it has made all of those problems go away. It is smaller and lighter than any books, and it is waterproof! I can read it anywhere, and at any time, like in the rain, pool, or at the beach, and even at night with the lights turned off! Plus I don't have storage problems with my reading materials. Now, if I can just convince Amazon to fix my medical problems.......!"
Marjorie R Sweeney,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love how lightweight it is. The battery last forever, I actually charged it and than didn't even use it for a week and it still had most of the charge. The backlight is amazing , I like how easy it is to change the size of the letters and turn the pages, it is very responsive , no lagging."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Seems to hold a charge forever. Very easy to disregard the advertising. The interface is kludgy and not intuitive at all. A hassle to have to touch hidden icons to switch between landscape to portrait modes. Pricey.
Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely disappointing! I've had quite a few kindles. This is uncomfortable to hold due to the placement of the buttons and unlike older models does not let you turn it upside down to compensate. LED coloration tends toward green. And when I backpage it seems to go back to where ever it wants to. They narrowed the range of the font sizes. They have lowered the product quality over time. It is not a great sign. After looking forward to this purchase, well, sigh, It's simply not an improvement over the original. It's a far cry from it in almost every way.

Finishing my book and sending it back."
Trisha,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It's too small! When you have to make the print larger to read, then you're constantly turning pages. I'd rather tap than swipe & almost every tap it would flash black. I called customer service, went through their trouble shooting process and it worked for a few hours and then started flashing black again. It was also so much slower than my last version. Amazon offered me a refurbished one, but I decided I'd rather have a refund."
Marjorie D.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s an e reader. I don’t think it’s worth the price. The screen isn’t as fantastic as reviews I have read. I still get ads even though I paid for no ads. If I had to do it again I would have bought a more basic model. I see today it has come out in blue, black was my only choice. On the plus side, it is very light to hold"
Gina,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this device as my son's Christmas gift. I read many reviews and questions and answers. Everything points me to believe I can play Audio books I bought at amazon audible on this Kindle paper white device. Also I can use Overdrive from local library. I spent a good portion of time today tried to play my son's favorite audio books, Harry Potter series on kindle paper white. I even called Amazon, searched online. I can't. I will keep research for a few days. If I can't do it, I have to return the device."
Fayne,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am still learning my new Kindle, but I like it. I do wish it had come with a start up instruction booklet; however.
I am very happy with the size and weight, as I have never really liked my Kindle Fire, basically because of its weight.
I am pleased with the cover I purchased for it, too, as I like to take care of my toys.😊"
Murray,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle Paperwhite and I find it even better than its predecessors. More features, fast recharging, changeover from my last Paperwhite very smooth with Wi-Fi. Special book offers look interesting, but I haven't used them yet.

I still miss EVERYWORD and wish it would be included once again!"
Veronica C. Thompson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the paperwhite. this is my second one. I went to charge the battery, and all I got was a white screen with a rectangle showing (looks like a flashdrive), with an ! in the middle of it. Cannot open, charge, anything. It appears to be DEAD. Cannot find out from Amazon web site who I can talk to. very frustrated. My old one is at least five years old and still works. How do I reach a person to see if there is something I can do.??????"
Ernestine Ward,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift and I thoroughly enjoy reading from this tablet. I had another kindle but there was no light in it and I stopped using it because it was difficult to see the words, but this one is very easy to read from. It is also easy to maneuver thru the various settings. Just read instructions before beginning."
Jonn Morlin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle provides immediate access to books that I have waited months to receive from our local library system. I love the many features: pages read, percent of book read, dictionary to give definition of words that are highlighted, and there are other features that I haven't discovered yet.
Was disappointed in the size of the device -- thought it would be closer to a 8"" x 10"" size format. I have adjusted the type size and it is working well."
Dave F,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fairly easy to use. Be sure to read instructions. I made mistake of seeing items in my library thinking they were already downloaded to the kindle. Font is easy to read and is clearly visible at the beach and in low light environments. Lightweight makes it easy to use in one hand. I do miss the old kindle page forward/back buttons on both sides of kindle making using kindle in left hand awkward. Overall a good value with lots of memory.
Joseph L Gagliardi,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This functions well as an e-reader. Best feature is the extended battery life. Does not work well as an audible reader. It has no internal speaker and requires a Bluetooth device to hear the reader. Unfortunately, the Bluetooth failed to connect to most of my devices. All my devices connect to my Fire. Recommend a Kindle Fire... A much more capable device at a lower cost."
Brittany Young,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally broke down and bought a Kindle. I’m a HUGE bookworm and, while I’ve always stuck to *real* books, I don’t have enough room in my house for them all! I got it after a trip with friends and I’d injured my eye so the Kindle was a great option to have as you can use large print on it! I’ve read quite a few on the Kindle and have to say I absolutely love it. Great for late-night reading and love all the amazing deals I can get on books. Genius!"
Daryl Harris,5.0 out of 5 stars,So impressed with this Kindle! It excels at minimalist design and usability. Such a better alternative to staring at my iPhone screen at night reading stuff. The Kindle has a subtle backlight that you can adjust to an almost imperceptible level that’s just enough to read without any eye strain. Love it. Highly recommend.
Elizabeth Gordon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The size is perfect - it fits in a purse, even just barely in my back pocket when I need hands free in a hurry. The light has worked in all environments wonderfully. Navigating a book and bookmarking and battery life are all superb. If has really helped me to read more - I hate reading on tablets, but even backlit this doesn't bother me whatsoever and feels even easier than reading from a real book since pages aren't reflecting bright light and it works in such low lighting.

Only cons I've had is that there's a bit of lag with the touch screen, but it only bothers me with initial set up or typing, and the power button is on the bottom which means if I lean it upright while reading it sometimes clicks on accident, but it turns back on easily and isn't an issue."
clayton scott niemann,3.0 out of 5 stars,"ONE) The light is real nice, i no longer need a clamped on mini spot for illumination while the wife drifts off to sleep. TWO) The touch screen for page turning is finicky, often taking 3 swipes to change the page -- sometimes only the one swipe flips forward 5-6 pages. THREE) The need for recharging before three days -- wi-fi OFF -- light setting 10 -- gen three lasted for nearly a week at same reading rate with a 6 year old battery. FOUR) The U.I. is clunky ... programmer's have had 25 years to work out a smooth UI and hundreds of thousands of historical man-hours to come up with a better filing \ collections method, and the sort is a pain and doesn't seem to actually sort by the selections made."
KHoj,4.0 out of 5 stars,When I first used the new Paperwhite there was an issue with the battery charge draining rapidly. As a result I posted a one star review. Amazon customer service contacted me after that review and put me in contact with a representative from their technical support group. Very impressed by their commitment to addressing the issue. Please to write that my Paperwhite is now working as I expected.
LAHB1223,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this new Kindle paperwhite. I am comfotable with reading it in the bathtub which is my favorite place to read. It is only a fraction smaller than my previous paperwhite so I don't noticed any appreciable difference. The only thing a little irritating is the ""warm up"" period when turning the Kindle on after not using it for a while. Also at the rate I read, the battery is not going to last as long as advertised"
Marge V.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Paperwhite is great, the bad part is the on/off switch at the bottom. I have inadvertently shut it off numerous times while reading. The battery life or recharge was supposed to last longer than kindle7 and it does last somewhat longer but not a week. No games."
Howard M. Kesselman,3.0 out of 5 stars,I find this very combersome to organize my library. Worked much much better using a laptop. I will probably go back to the laptop and not use this. Also on off switch is in the wrong place and I turn this off too easily when I read on it. So overall I am not very excited with this. Fortunately not very expensive.
Jack Wolf,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this device. The screen is great for reading, especially at night. I just wish the touchscreen was more responsive. It's not a deal-breaker but the sensitivity on the touchscreen could definitely be better. It seems like Amazon is resting on its laurels and not improving the screens at the rate they could. Aside from that, its a great device that I have used every day since I purchased it. If you are an avid reader I definitely recommend it. I like the fact that it is small and easy to carry. You can pop this thing into an EDC bag and not even know its there."
brxy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter bought this for me for Christmas, what a surprise!!! This is my 2nd paperwhite, I love the new one! It is thinner, responds quickly. Not sure if the battery in this newer paperwhite is as good as my 2nd Generation one, but it is still fantastic! Love being able to read at night & not disturb my husband!"
vincent,2.0 out of 5 stars,"In comparison to my 10 year old Kindle, this did not meet my expectations. Does not hold a charge as long as expected. Easier to find book on the ""old"" Kindle (alphabetized). I find myself using the ""first"" Kindle and this was not the purpose of purchasing the paper white.easier"
Lynn SA,3.0 out of 5 stars,"it seems that the settings , especially for font size are not stable. mine keeps getting changed, maybe by a slight pressure to the on/off button. very annoying. the position of the on/off button is on the bottom, when I set it down or prop it up on something (treadmill stand for example) it constantly changes font size, turns off, etc. can there be a ""lock"" on the font size? I find this over-sensitivity to be annoying and interferes with the flow of my reading."
AmazonSeller,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this as a gift. It’s super slim-lines. I’m not sure why, but I’ve only read about an hour or so on it, yet I’ve charged it a total of three times. I’m concerned it’s a “lemon” or I’m doing something wrong that’s shortening its battery life. I thought it just sleeps when not in use, but I should probably be powering it down instead."
Beholden,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the fifth Kindle in our household. I replaced an earlier Paperwhite with this new larger-storage device because I like to travel with access to many books and magazines. With this one, I can read where I want - out in the sun or in a dark room - and what I want, depending upon my mood. I haven't had the new device long enough to judge battery life, but I have found it goes for days without a recharge. It's all I need."
Grammy M,2.0 out of 5 stars,The size is very convenient. The swiping is a pain in the butt. Sometimes it takes you backwards in your book. Sometimes a miniature screen appears. The size of the font changes even when it's been reset a half dozen times. It was an early gift and I'm ready to return it.
P. Schmehl,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had this a little over a year and it was not used hard. I wanted to use it today but found the screen displayed only a battery with an exclamation point inside of it. After much searching for solutions I am unable to reset or charge it. Of course, the return and warranty dates have expired. Do not waste your money."
Eriela,5.0 out of 5 stars,This kindle is great! Easy to read inside or outside. Battery life is amazing and love that it is waterproof. It’s so light and easy to hold. My only compliant is that the touch screen is very sensitive. Water droplets will turn the page and you have to be careful where you grab it as you will easily turn multiple pages.
Jerry R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only used this for a couple of weeks and am enjoying it. It is easier to hold than my iPad, yet larger than my phone for easy viewing. I have only downloaded some condensed free books to test it out so I cannot yet share the experience of purchasing/downloading full books. I do not see a problem though. Very intuitive interface Im looking forward to downloading some larger books and see how that goes. I would suggest this to anyone who wants a smaller screen (very light and easy to hold in one hand) Im very impressed."
Brian Montgomery,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've wanted a kindle paperwhite for awhile as reading on a clunky fire tablet is just too much of an inauthentic reading experience for me. I appreciate the fact that the paperwhite is lightweight and waterproof. I much prefer this at night in bed to my fire.

Now I am frustrated that my cable does not fit well and my kindle inverts the colors briefly when flipping pages. That is incredibly bothersome and I'm wondering how to fix it or if anyone else experiences it."
Alec Kline,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Imagine if your TV constantly displayed advertisements while it was “off.” Or what if your phone displayed ads when you locked your screen. That’s what it is like to own a kindle. What type of rating would you give a TV, phone, or tablet like that?

Half the time I go to pick up my kindle I see bill gates staring at me promoting some books.

There are no options for screensavers, and no way to turn the advertisements off.

Once you unlock the kindle, you are still not free from advertisements as there is a banner at the bottom inch or so if the screen that displays more amazon ads."
Cheryl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th Kindle and I have to say I’m not as impressed with this one as prior models. This Kindle sometimes will not connect to WiFi to download books and even with airplane mode on the battery life is poor. My prior Kindles the battery would last over a month - this one, I’m luck to get 3 days! Not impressed!"
M. Gymnopoulos,5.0 out of 5 stars,I don't have any of the issues described by a few reviewers. My battery life is great (lasts for weeks). I don't have any problems with blurry or patchy screen lighting. I like that the screen is now flush with the frame. It's still a light weight device. No issues with the on/off button either. I haven't pressed it once accidentally without or with case .
Tasha P.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I prefer my older version and wish the new screen itself was larger. Yes, I can change the print format, but I simply prefer a larger screen. I don't like the touchscreen with no buttons. I can maneuver pretty well with this, but as far as I can tell, the only way to shut off ""24/7"" wifi is to put it in airplane mode. Don't mind the special offers. If you have an older kindle model, you have to read the instructions several times to maneuver. I hope the waterproof feature is worth it. I only bought it because my older model is malfunctioning and the right side buttons don't work, auto invoking a crazy search feature if you touch the right side buttons. Rebooting the old one doesn't work."
CCV,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly after two months I find this thing kind of subpar. The reading experience is good but the OS is slow and clunky, the screen responsiveness is poor, and the UI isn’t great. I expected more."
Donald Cooper,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I should have had one of these years ago. 70+ years old,so I bought the users manual also . I was tricked by the free Washington Post offer. Free for six months and then $3.99 per month after ! That was Washington Post "" FAKE"" advertising"
B. Stachelski,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well I have not dropped it in the pool or bathtub to test is't waterproofness but I love it. I have all my books in easy access. I love the backlight. I had traded in a much cheaper version and made sure to get the extra storage. It is so nice to have it close by and always within reach. It is easy on the eyes.
Dianalytical,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I bought the Kindle Paperwhite, I was used to reading Kindle books on my smartphone and tablet. I liked the navigation and features of the Kindle app (Android), but I couldn't read outdoors because of the glare and the 10-inch tablet was just too heavy to hold comfortably. I love that the Paperwhite is light that I can hold it easily for hours and that I can finally read in bright sunlight. I just wish the navigation was more similar to the Android app, which was more intuitive and easier to use."
Justin L,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this because I wanted something lighter than my Kindle Fire, but was extremely disappointed in the quality of the user interface. It feels like something made two decades ago. Touching the screen felt unresponsive and slow, and the screen flickered jarringly between screen changes. Black and white inversion mode made this even worse. The physical screen did diffuse glare effectively and it was light and sturdy, but overall this is a downgrade I can’t stomach- especially at double the price of a Fire!"
ManfredWD,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Chose during Prime days for my wife who reads at least four books per month and likes to read at bedtime. She is more than pleased with the unit functionality, portability and ease of reading. With Amazon selections subscription, she has all she reads to feed her favorite habit and to lead several book clubs. Not sure how they will improve this."
dottiecampanella,2.0 out of 5 stars,Is small and difficult for hands w/arthritis to hold. Don't like swiping for next page. It will skip ahead on it's own and have had difficulty getting it to return back. Had to chat w/Amazon for a fix. This item was a Christmas gift and not one I would have picked out. No games! No real list of books on a page items displayed are crammed together as covers of books. Not an item I like LOVE my older Kindle
Jacqueline A. Lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had one of the first models, and decided to get a new version. This one is a great price for a good read. I have downloaded several free books already . Now to get reading.....

Only one problem is I wish it came with a good instruction book so you could get around without the trial and error method."
Gary Myles Edwards,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The increase in storage from my previous Kindle Paperwhite and being waterproof are the reasons I purchased this new model, my older gen. Paperwhite doesn't even come close to holding all my books; so far, this one does. I also bought it for the touted added text-to-speech feature which the previous gen. Paperwhite lacked, though I've yet to try it. In any case, it's disappointingly English-only. I own an Italian e-reader with illuminated screen (admittedly not as nicely done as the Paperwhite, either gen.) which I purchased perhaps 10 years ago, which does have text-to-speech in English, Italian, French, German, and who knows what else. Further, it takes mini-SD cards so its storage capacity is essentially limitless. Sadly, Kindle has not seen fit to do the same."
Stuart,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle. I wasn’t sure how I’d like it moving from print books... I love it! Having a library at your disposal is awesome!

It’s excellent for night reading, being able to enjoy one’s media without the over stimulation that comes from other electronics. I also really enjoy its compact form design. Feels very comfortable in my hand. I realize this is old hat for those who have tried e-readers before, but I’ve been surprised just how much I enjoy it.

I originally thought to get it because I’d read through my books on trips and be left twiddling my thumbs. I thought this would suffice for those times, but now I find I use it all the time and read more than ever. I still read print books, but I won’t be without my Kindle companion."
Daniel J,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great...at first. And then after a while, the battery just dies. Never recharges, the light doesn't come on. Faulty Kindle charging port essentially. Different cables and usb chargers have the same result. So, you have a $130 paperweight! Amazon support won't help, they just tell you to buy a new paperweight (here's a 15% discount, like that makes the $100+ purchase any less annoying)."
Hazel Basil Bunnykins,5.0 out of 5 stars,My brother and sister gifted me a Paperwhite for Christmas and I am thoroughly enjoying it! No lag like my Fire had. Wake-up is swift and easy as well. I have charged it only once so far and STILL have battery life left! That’s almost three weeks on a single charge! This is definitely my new traveling companion eReader.
Ivy and Claire's Mom,5.0 out of 5 stars,I don't know why people are giving this reviews that say it's not as good as the previous version. It's definately better. I love it and I'm very glad I took a chance a bought it despite the negative reviews. Can't wait to take it to the pool and to the beach.
Lauren Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s perfect! Super lightweight and sleek. The backlight option is great. You can always turn it off to have it look like the old paper white screen, too. My husband loves the Audible feature! Best Kindle product I’ve ever owned. (Previously owned the Kindle Fire, get this instead!!!)"
Barbara,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle is easy on the eyes, has a massive selection of books, love that I have reading at my fingertips no matter where I am. The battery has a good life, so I don't have to charge it often even though I constantly read. Haven't figured everything out yet, but progressing nicely. The one item I miss, which I had with Barnes and Noble, is the ability to read my email."
Randi Silvers,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my 1st Kindle & I've always been iffy because I love the feeling of a real book, but this Kindle is amazing!! I can take it anywhere with me, even to the pool (thanks to it being waterproof), there is no glare from the sunshine, and it holds so many books! The built in light is perfect for night reading. It feels durable yet so light weight. I love it!!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love everything about this Kindle Paperwhite. I'm glad I ordered this version, have the screen backlit for night time reading is probably my favorite feature. Super lightweight and easy to use! One thing I will say, is I purchased it a week ago, and the price is now $40 less as they have a 25% discount for prime members. I asked Amazon if the would honor the price drop since I had received it less than a week ago, and I was very surprised to hear they would not. They said they do not offer price protection policies. Again--Amazon has always had wonderful customer service, so I was just surprised this was their response. My next recommendation is get one now with the lower price!"
Strydr,3.0 out of 5 stars,"In the literature that came with the device, there are instructions in how to drain the water from the device. I like many, bought this with the understanding that the immersion figures in the promotional advertisements were accurate. Apparently not. Since I bought this model specifically for inclement weather, I am not best pleased. Hence, the low rating for an otherwise exceptional product."
1011,4.0 out of 5 stars,This was difficult for me to order. I had to send it to the address of a friend about 2 miles from my home. This item requires special handling and cannot be sent to your address. I live in California. Apparently Californians can't buy Kindles. Other than that it works fine. Battery life is good and readability is excellent.
Alex,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this version! I had a much older version, like the 3rd edition or so, and this one is really nice as well! I havent fully tested the waterproof thing but when some did get in it it had no issues! I also really like that I can listen to audiobooks on it as well so I can have all my books in one place!"
Kathleen M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So... I’ve resisted using an e-reader for years... thought I needed the kinesthetics and olfactory inputs from a paper & glue bound book to enjoy a good “read”, but I was wrong! I recently travelled internationally and decided to give the Kindle a try just for the lightweight and multi content convenience... and I loved it! Lightweight, easy on the eyes, satisfyingly quick pages, easy to use & charge which lasts a long time... I’m a convert! I even bought a cool cover which automatically wakes & sleeps the Kindle... and it comes in orange!"
Aleks K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic device, I've been Kindle owner since 3rd Gen model and this is the lightest and the best Kindle so far. It could fit virtually in any pocket, build-in light allow you to adjust brightness depends on the condition and it is feather-lite. I can read a night time stories to my kids without disturbing external light.
Also you could download your books directly from Amazon or other stores (using build in browser)... it might be slow, but you don't really need a PC anymore, only if you would like to sync you existing large library."
AJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read by the pool a lot and I used to get my hard book pages wet. Now I have this kindle it’s great no worries about pages or the hard cover getting ruined. Also, so much easier to travel with. I used to read on my phone too and could never see my screen when I was outside. Now with the backlight and everything on the kindle I can read outside with no problem."
Jude,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked my old one better with the buttons on the side to click up and down. I read when I go to bed and I'm on my side. The kindle is set up on a pillow next to me and just clicking it page to page was much more convenient than holding it with its tiny little skinny frame and swiping. And then if I happen to doze off my thumb rests on one of the words on the screen and now I have to swipe back to remove the definition of the word 'the'. I'd prefer the frame to be a little bigger, I wish that there was an option of having the buttons to click but this is what we have in modern day technology. Someday maybe manufactures and creators will understand that if it's not broken don't fix it."
Kimber,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s not that I was planning on buying a new Paperwhite but when you go on vacation and leave yours on the plane.....YOURE NEVER GETTING IT BACK. My fault, tired and left it in the seat back...not my first time. So we go to Best Buy as there’s no Amazon store where we were and I got the latest version. I have to say, it’s faster and the battery life is much better."
CRomero,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received by first Kindle Paperwhite and a particular section of the Kindle repeatedly contained blurry words. At first I thought it was a smudge on the screen but quickly realized it was a problem with the ink. It was frustrating so I returned the Kindle for another new Kindle. Low and behold - the same issue exists with this Kindle.

I was looking forward to my first e-reader but the fuzziness of large swathes is words throws me off. I’ll be returning the item. Such a shame."
KEE,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the battery life so far. I’ve charged it once or twice in the month that I’ve had it. And I’ve read 4-5 books. Very lightweight. The lighting controls on the screen are great and easy to change. Only difficulty is it can’t seem to log in to WiFi that has a pop up browser login. I had this difficulty with a hotel WiFi.
Francine Russell,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an old Kindle which I loved...I could click either side which was great being left handed...it was very easy to purchase new books and I had a number of “pages” showing which books I owned.
With this new Paperwhite it often skips several pages forward or backwards when I touch the corner. I also have not figured out how to purchase books that I want...not the ones that appear....I am a creature of habit but hopefully I will be able to figure this one out."
M. Gordon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow. Finally 300 dpi resolution with 32 gb on board memory and is working. I now have all of my books and audio books in one place.

Easy to use and read. Lightweight. The lighting at times in unnatural, but effective.

Simply an achievement."
Gary,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got frustrated with it, Half of the time I didn't know what page I was on.
I have reset it to factory defaults and am planning to give it to some stranger."
William Schluter,3.0 out of 5 stars,I liked the backlit screen. I do not like the fact that the screen is no bigger and yet there is still insufficient border around the screen to hold it comfortably without accidentally turning the page. The touch screen is too touchy and sometimes jumps forward or backward seemingly at random. Also the many features that I am sure it has are not intuitive and I still don't know where the manual is or if there is one included in the library. I don't know how to turn features off and even if I need to shut it down when I am done reading. I still cannot figure out how to access the dictionary which is one of the most compelling features of the kindle. It appears sometimes when I open my cover but I don't know how to open it on a certain word. Battery life is fine but then I never had a problem with my old one.
donna sharp,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the size, the features are good, but I don't think the screen is as bright as it could be. I like to read when outside and it seems like it is better than my old Kindle Fire, but for inside, I find it a little less bright for my old eyes. So, I don't really have any issues, just taking time to get used to the black and white that is just different."
Pen Name,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Print way to small like my color kindle much better!
Cheaply made very disappointed in this kindle!
Have ms my eye sight not to good!
Very difficult to read!
Do not want to hurt my husband feeling so I can’t return it. It was a Christmas present that will go in a draw!
Will use my old kindle!"
Dee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked everything about this Kindle. It is small and slips right into my purse. It has a long battery life. It is also waterproof. Though I liked it very much I had to send it back. It is not because it is a bad product, my eyes are going bad and I am having a hard time reading. I need the extra extra large print, though it is capable of doing that, it will only show 2 or 3 sentences at a time on the screen, therefore I have to keep swiping the page to turn, which I didn't like. If you don't need extra extra large print I would highly recommend this product. I was disappointed that I was not able to keep it because of my own lack of sight. (I received this as a gift and the giver did not realize my sight issue)"
Linda Swanson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love love my Kindle Paperwhite! I now have now any book I want at my fingertip! No more lugging heavy books everywhere I go! Hubby loves the fact that he doesn't have to pack my extra books when we travel! The screen is extremely clear and readable, even outdoors, at the beach, etc! The back light helps when I'm reading in bed and hubby is asleep!"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very disappointed I could not access the games I had on my previous Kindle. I received the new Kindle as a birthday present right before I was going on vacation, and my husband and I like to play the games on my Kindle when we fly. When I went to play, there were no games that came up on my Kindle. I called for help and was told the new Kindle does not have the ability to download games. I did not see that in the description. I made the mistake of assuming if it were in the previous Kindle it would been the new upgraded Kindle."
Whittney,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love my Kindle Paperwhite. This is easier for me to carry around than a book and I actually do enjoy it as much as holding a real paperback (easier to wield on public transport too). I can read on a dark plane without bugging everyone. I dig that I can get library books on it too (though an annoying process)
That being said the user experience is absolutely dreadful. Basically nothing about it is good. One ex: sometimes you try to get a menu at the top of the screen and you turn a page (but have to figure out which way it turned, because you were pushing the top/center of the screen). It's terrible and I love it."
Eric,2.0 out of 5 stars,"In the online commentary about this product, people always ask ""How do you power it off?"" and Amazon tries to claim that leaving it on all the time doesn't drain the battery. I'm telling that it DOES lose power SIGNIFICANTLY just sitting there unused. I bought this product really wanting to love it, but I've been super disappointed by the necessity of constantly charging it up. After a full 100% charge, I turned the screen off, without using it: next day the power was at 84%, and the day after that, again without using it, the power was down to 66%. One time I charged it up, then went away for a week, leaving it at home. When I returned, it was totally dead. Use the Kindle app on your phone instead, it's more convenient and more comfortable to hold, as well."
trom2k,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased about 2 weeks ago and have read about an hour every other day. Battery still going after initial full charge. This was an upgrade from a Kindle Touch. Most notable feature is the back light which makes it great for reading in the dark or when you don't want to disturb someone with light. I had a case on the Touch that had a light bar on it and while functional wasn't the best.

Only cons are that the touchscreen isn't as responsive as I was hoping and booting up from sleep seems to take longer than expected.

Overall it performs well and worth the purchase in my opinion."
Zazabel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Light as a feather, despite previous reviews complaining about short battery time while in use,mine is holding up much longer. I download my books and turn off bluetooth and wifi which are an unnecessary drain on battery. I have not used this for any of my audible books so far. So I cannot attest to battery time with bluetooth on"
Joni,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s light and small and you can carry it anywhere you want, it even fits into the pocket of your jacket. The kindle makes me spend more time on reading, which is great, since I’m learning something new. But you have to be patient because it doesn’t response as quickly as your iPhone does. And sometimes it crashes, which can be frustrating. But their support team is responsible and can help you with it. Overall, I’m happy with my purchase"
Beth S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Still learning the device. Have only had it a week. Battery seems to hold up very well, but currently I am only reading 15-60 min per day (not charging in between). Very light-weight to hold vs a book. Very comfortable. I bought an inexpensive Finite cover and it is great too. Hopefully the leather covers that have poor reviews for this device will be upgraded before I need another cover."
anon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The paperwhite is great for reading in a room with medium or low light. It eliminates the need for a bright reading light shining over my shoulder. I like the storage capacity of books for travel and long plane flights. The unit is new and the battery life seems fine at this point. The touch screen works fine. My only complaint is that it is slightly less comfortable to hold for a long period than printed books.
DB86,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This kindle is exactly what I was looking for. It is very basic and good for reading books. The screen is clear and moves smoothly when reading and it’s very easy on the eyes. Scrolling through the home screen is a bit slow and pixelated. Entering the password on the lock screen can be problematic at times but it’s not a huge issue. If you type too fast, the kindle does not recognize all the numbers you’ve entered and you’ll have to do it again. Overall, I like this kindle and would recommend."
Annette Mattil,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the Kindle reader 8th generation, which I liked, but I was limited in using because there wasn't a backlight. But the Kindle Paperwhite does have a backlight and I have unlimited access to reading, no matter what time of the day. I read a couple books a week and it's great to have the ability to read in the middle of the day or the middle of the night."
J. Vargas,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my new kindle. Nice update from my kindle touch. 1. Love adjustable back light. Not too bright, adjustable. 2. Sensible touchscreen . Battery life... well, been unsing it for a week. Will get back to you on that one.

Got the advertising free option, so you just flip open kindle's cover and you start reading (no fuss).

Would I buy it again. Sure!"
lorraine,3.0 out of 5 stars,MY PURCHASE IS RELATIVELY NEW AND I HAVE NO LEARNED COMPLETELY HOW TO USE IT. CALLING AMAZON IS NOT A GREAT HELP AS THEY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE ITEM AND ARE NOT IN THE U.S.
Charlie X,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Endless battery life, great adjustable backlight, and easy to read in any kind of light, unlike ipad, phone, etc type of screens. Lightweight and convenient."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my fourth Kindle. I had one when they first came out and my next two were Fires. I really only use this to read books and the battery on both my Fires just stopped working. I decided to go with the paperwhite. I am extremely happy with my purchase. This has the absolute look and feel of a regular book. I leave my Kindle on airplane mode so the battery holds a long time. Lighting is perfect in any light situation. Touch Screen is no problem.
Jacque Hansen,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Kindles! I wanted to upgrade. I like the idea of it being waterproof. However my new one will shut off for no reason. It will freeze up so I cannot turn the page. I have to turn it off and back on so I can change pages. Also the font size changes on its own. I wish there was a way to set the font so it does not change so easily. Also it has quit holding a charge for more than a day or two.

On the positive side I love its small easy to hold size. I love having so many books available without having a bunch of books to carry. I love reading in bright sunlight or a dark room with no lights. So I keep plugging away ....
Yes I have tried rebooting it and it does ok for just awhile.

I would very much like to replace it.

William P. Flynn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had purchased the Kindle Oasis and after just a few months left it on an airplane and was unsuccessful in getting it returned.
I replaced it with the Kindle Paperwhite at much less cost.
The paperwhite is great, does what I need it to do, is compact, holds a lot of books, and the battery life is good.
Probably should have bought it to begin with."
L.Lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a Kindle for almost 5 years now and love the ability to carry most of my books on one thing. When going on vacation, I don't have to pack several books to make sure I have enough, all I need is my Kindle. My new Paperwhite makes it convenient to read wherever I am without having to worry about having enough light to see my screen. I am glad I upgraded."
Jim,1.0 out of 5 stars,"There is nothing about the Paperwhite that makes it that much better than the original Kindle I have. The battery runs down even when it is in the sleep or off mode. Th old one hardly ever needed to be charged. The old one is larger and easier to handle and I do not believe it weighs as much. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy the new one."
momof 5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good! It just came yesterday so haven’t got to check out the battery life yet. Love the sleek look of it! I’m looking forward to taking it to the beach and not having to worry about sand in the corners of the screen anymore! Hoping to love it just as much as my previous kindle."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from my 3rd gen kindle keyboard and absolutely love it! Love the touch screen and backlight feature. I often read at night, and sometimes after my husband goes to bed, so it’s nice to be able to turn the lights off and still read in bed. We have become minimalists so being able to invest in books without compromising space is wonderful, and we travel a lot so we have access to all our books with just one device. Amazing!"
Rachel Camejo,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ok so I do love my kindle BUT you have to keep it in airplane mode when you are not using to conserve the battery meaning it is not connected to WiFi and if you go too long with battery low it can kill your kindle. That almost happened to mine. So just keep that in mind but other than that great little product.
Lisa A Peters,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always loved the paperwhite reader, I don't like the glare on the kindle fires, mainly because I work on computers all day and don't want to read on that sort of screen at night, my eyes need a break. I'm excited the new paperwhite is water resistant as I dropped my last 2 paperwhites in the tub while reading, so now if that happens, it should be ok!"
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am upgrading from a Fourth Generation kindle, so my review is more about its upgrades rather than it specifically. So, if you’re not used to the kindle atmosphere than this will be great for you, but this review is more about things I didn’t like as an old Kindle user.

1st, the battery life. It’s horrible especially when compared to what’s advertised. The banners on the website all showed the battery lasted months instead of weeks(like my old kindle). My old kindle was great, because it’s battery lasted about two weeks under constant use. This kindle, if used regularly, will last a couple of days, and if WiFi is turned on it loses battery fast. Along with the minor problems that I didn’t like the time it takes to open and that the screen isn’t any noticeably sharper, the new kindle gets two stars."
sisie q,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The nook does not support books obtained from other sources then Barnes & Nobles.
I downloaded a book from another source & 5 times when I advanced the page it jumped back to the first page.
I called support & was essentially told that the software was such that there was no guarantee that that wouldn't happen. To ensure this wouldn't happen it was necessary to obtain your books from BN. Was also told the software had been upgraded. What a disaster. My previous Nook, that I had for 5-6 yrs this was never a problem. Needless to say I returned my Nook & purchased a Kindle. It makes one wonder why a new software upgrade would not allow for downloading a book from another source. Sad."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th kindle. It works great except for one issue that is extremely annoying. Apparently, when the battery is getting low, the kindle just won't come on. It won't come on until it gets some unknown amount of charge. You get no warning that this will happen. I researched and found that others had the same issue."
Kactus Ken,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an older version of PaperWhite. It works well, but is thicker, small memory, and somewhat short battery life. This updated version is a 99% improvement. The missing 1% is this. I like the continuous frame to screen surface, but it does lead to unwanted page advances (retreats) somewhat often. I have to be careful to hold only the frame and not let a digit wander to the screen! While sort of annoying, the other advances make it worth the buy. It didn't hurt that a ""sale"" price appeared at a good moment."
MarkBecca,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the size and weight of the Kindle - it is easy on my wrist and (suspiciously) light.
The screen is easy to read, with no glare even in high lighting; the brightness of the screen is easily adjustable and I like that I can invert the black/white (inverted makes for better nighttime reading for me personally).
Browsing for new books is a bit of an adjustment as the screen is not fluid as smartphones and tablets are- but I like that it has a simple up/down for scrolling through the store and a simple side-screen touch for 'turning pages' while reading.
Adjusting the size of the text is very simple (pinch or splay).

Hopefully I never have to test the waterproof feature, but I am excited to take it on vacation to Florida this spring and not have to worry about it."
Florence Anne,2.0 out of 5 stars,"this is our kindle #4 of five -- but we have purchased seven actually -- a couple for gifts -- so this one has issues -- it has to be charged daily, it turns on if it is picked up or is being carried or if the table it's on is bumped or not bumped -- it shuts down all the way and reboots itself often -- so I know amazon will do right by us -- they always do --"
Deb Mattia,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very excited to order this for the sale price of $89.99. It is a beautiful device with a crisp, clear, and responsive screen. It is also very light and easy to use. However, the battery would not hold a charge. It was charged to 100% and after ~8 hours of no use, when I wanted to use it, the battery was only at 90%. So I returned it and will go back to my Nook Glowlight 3 which has a battery that lasts many days, even after reading for hours at a time. Very disappointing."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this one to listen to my audiobooks. To my great disappointment, the Bluetooth function of this one doesn't work well. I usually use my Airpod for my new kindle paperwhite. Each time I try to connect my Airpod to my kindle, It is failed so I have to try again and again... several times. Now I give up listening to my audiobooks with my kindle and go back to the Audible App on my iPad or my mobile phone.
I should have bought the previous generation of the kindle paperwhite!"
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Being the only electronic device I can read in the sun is the first best thing. Second being waterproof I can now feel confident on a pool float, and that's worth the price. The only th is I don't like is the way you have to bookmark, one click is usually the norm. I don't like having 20 click on the little x to get the bookmark on and off."
Baigalimaa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never used Kindle before. This was my first kindle. And i absolutely love it. I have never read so many books before. It is very light weight, easy to carry with me. Whenever i have time to read I just take it out my purse and can read. Easy on the eyes ."
Jean K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is so awesome as I have plenty of room for all my books and I feel the waterproof is a great addition to this kindle, especially if you have little ones, as accidents do happen. I am sure that anyone who purchased kindles in the past will enjoy this one as well."
kc lady,5.0 out of 5 stars,"While I've only had my new 2018 Paperwhite for a week, I've noticed I can download books MUCH faster than I could with my old Paperwhite. However, interested people should note that it is slightly smaller than the older model, therefore, it is important to order a 2018 Paperwhite version for any cover you'd like to purchase. The ""old"" covers (pre-2018 10th Generation) are too big and cannot be used."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered a Paperwhite from the previous release and sent it back after a few days. The page turning was choppy and distracting and the built in lights only lit the edge of the screen. The center was dingy. This one (version 10) is great! The problems have been corrected and the Kindle is once again a pleasure to use. Very happy with purchase!
utah5654,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Hate it!!!!
I don’t know what amazon did but now all of my books are showing up on my home page and not inside the collection folders!!!!!
I’m so UPSET! Idk what I have read already because the collection folders do not work properly!!! I have 363 books on my kindle and they are all over the place and not organized anymore!!!"
Vivian Zuniga,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish I bought this product sooner! Works great & highlighting/taking notes is so easy...it gives you the option to list the passages highlighted and takes you to that page. Battery life is really long, I’ve only had it for 5 days and have read for many many hours and battery is barely at 45%. Its helpful that you can get a definition of a word or translation by highlighting it. I highly recommend!"
MJ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My new Kindle works great, but it was cumbersome setting up. I had to call support and they had to do some type of update that took awhile. I could have never done it myself. Also, my biggest gripe is the cost. I asked my kids to get me a new Kindle for my birthday. My old one did not have any lighting, so I wanted one with lighting. I was shocked at the price when I looked it up - embarrassed that I asked for it after I found out how much it cost. Also, what do I do with my old Kindle? I asked and the Kindle assistant said to use one in the day and one at night. I don't really need two!"
Skiswife,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe I just read a LOT, but the battery (while better than previous versions) seems to drain a little faster than advertised.

In any case, I love my Paperwhite, just like I love my Fire tablet. The bonus of a Paperwhite is that I can ""check out"" and use it EXCLUSIVELY for reading - No interruptions."
Luis F. Reyes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved this Kindle, that I never really enjoyed on my iPad. This is easier to read and carry. The only problem is the ilustrations, pictures and graphs look horrible."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is clearly designed for a child. As an average size adult male, this little device was like a child's toy in my hands and there was no way to hold it comfortably. The small screen was not good to read on and I have returned this item. It in no way replicates reading a book in size or feel. I liked my old school Kindle much better."
Guy fanelli,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first ever kindle. I noticed a lot of people complain about the battery life. Yes, the kindle will not last for eternity while connected to wifi or other things, BUT GUESS WHAT, you can put the kindle in airplane mode to make the battery last as advertised. And then when you want to download another book, YOU CAN TURN THE AIRPLANE MODE OFF. *mind blowing*

I love this product though. Have not tested the waterproof feature (and dont intend to), but the backlight addition to kindles is awesome. I have no problems reading anywhere."
Dan Rockel,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have purchased a lot from Amazon. This is my first bad rating. I have, in the past, purchased two other kindle whites for gifts and they have been awesome. This one has been horrible. The battery from the day I got it has been horrible. it might last a week and a half before it dies. I just bought it in August of 2019. So, being under warranty, I asked for a replacement. It was a non stop battle. They even told me just to switch batteries with the one my wife has. Hers is older and the battery life can hold up to six months and she uses it constantly. Still no replacement, just told me to let it die out and do it again. HORRIBLE customer service. I do not suggest buying from them."
PeteNJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To be fair, I could only use the Fire HD in the dark. Any ambien light produced too much glare for my old eyes. I'm very pleased with the visual performance of my new PaperWhite. There is nothing to adjust when I move from a dark setting to a bright one. One thing that annoys me though is how slow the page turn is when compared to my old Fire HD."
Mary Lyn,4.0 out of 5 stars,The extra storage and longer lasting charge are good. But I can't get my favorite solitaire game on it.
Char,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really like this for reading. It's small enough to fit easily in a purse but print is crisp and large enough (also font adjustable). It's my first paperwhite. I bought it in punch red!
Everything is in black and white (no color) or interactive videos but that's what also makes the battery last a long time."
JohnKae,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried everything to get the device to turn on but will not and customer service is useless. If you want a device that just shows a picture of a dead battery then this is for you. They will not replace it because I am 2 weeks out of warranty. I bought it for my wife for christmas last year and have read 2 books on it for a total of $180. Apparently if you let the device go completely dead you cannot recharge it and its done for. Do yourself a favor, visit your local library and save some money. As a matter of fact SUPPORT your local library."
Star*,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you do not need a new paperwhite do NOT buy the 2018 version, and if you need decent customer service FORGET IT. Amazon basically has a corner on the market so it doesn't need to actually improve its devices when offering a new one. I am particularly annoyed with the smaller-than-before menu bar, since one of the reasons I use a kindle is the easy-to-read font size. I find the new keyboard equally frustrating as the 'keys' often don't work without several hits, and again, the size issue. I asked for a replacement due to several functionality issues, was put off by condolences and ineffectual offers at help, finally given the go-ahead to send mine in for a replacement, and instead was sent a so-called repair job. I really wish I had not purchased this model but now I'm stuck with it."
Shannon Bridges,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for something I could read my books on without the distractions of social media, texts, emails.... I personally love the new paper white. It’s really easy to read books on it. Its a lot easier on my eyes then some of the other devices I’ve read on. It’s great having all my books with me wherever I go. It seems well built and durable. Battery life is good. I read 4-6 hours daily and it will last 7-8 days between charging. I also got the water safe fabric cover and love it too. It looks great on the kindle. I love that I can read in the bath or at the pool. Only issues I’ve had so far is that there’s a slight delay when you turn page sometimes it’s not bad just a little annoying. And there’s a slight delay going through all your books when looking for a new one to read. Overall I’m happy and have no regrets buying it."
S. Cawelti,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my old Paperwhite for this model, and bought it without a cellular connection. Mistake. I’ll use it as a wi-fi only device but won’t buy another without cellular. It doesn’t consistently update, and downloading is problematic so much of the time. My mistake, really—device is fine, and I used it a lot, with the perfect size for carrying it everywhere. But connection needs to be both wi-fi and cellular."
Dee K.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery life doesn't seem as long as my previous paperwhite, but it's still very good. The only issue I have with thus new one, is I turn it off by accident all the time! The button must be dufferent or something. As I am reading, I guess it's how I hold it, it just turns off. Otherwise, its great."
Shan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love how small and compact this Kindle is. It being waterproof is definitely a plus for me because I can be a bit clumsy but also because I like to read while taking a bath some times. When they say a glare-free screen, they're not kidding! Even with the back light on, I was still able to read the screen with the sun shining directly on it. Very happy with my purchase!"
NutellaBabe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this device for a bit over a month now. It's an upgrade from my prior Kindle from 2013. I wanted the backlit feature so can read in the dark.
There are a lot of updated features which don't particularly impact my reading experience but they are nice to see/have.

It's very light and portable. Good buy on Prime day!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Better light, love the weight - especially after trying to use a heavy book. I read it faster - print can be adjusted so my eyes don't have to strain. Kids bought the original for me but decided it was time for a new one. Like it better than trying to read on my phone - battery life is fantastic for traveling."
Felipe A.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Its a truly dirt move from amazon to send me unwanted ads through kindle. There used to be pretty images instead but amazon changed it without my permission and now I cant prevent the ads from appearing. Really abusive and client-disrespectful move
txfem,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My new Kindle Paperwhite is a bit disappointing. Description says the battery lasts for weeks, not days. Most of the time my battery doesn't even last a week and I am not a heavy reader. The battery in my first Paperwhite did indeed last for weeks on a full charge. This is also described as the thinnest Paperwhite. Perhaps the battery is too thin. Just disappointed."
jill whitney,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Like: everything Dislike: Where is my library? My old paperwhite had to be charged every nite, but this one was working then it seemed to quit shortly after being charged. I was able to load some books that I had bought and didn't seem to be on new kindle. I hadn't read them yet and they were in my Library. I am working on solving the charging problem (bad wire or plug?) Kindle currently charging but I can't get in to continue reading. I'm 84 and not as quick a learner as I used to be. I need to get used to it. I use it constantly and love it. Can't find The Hallows by Methos,backlash by Thor, Vines by Rice, Final Reckoning by Bailey, & One Good Deed by Baldacci."
B. King,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall UI experience sluggish, noticeable delay responding to user gestures. Hopefully this can be addressed with a software update."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is simply a stellar product. It weighs next to nothing, has exceptional battery life (provided you don’t have the lighting turned all the way up), is durable, and does its job very very well. I love being able to hold it in only one hand. I have some joint issues so heavy books can cause an issue for me (King’s “It” for example). I’ve seen some negative review for the new paperwhite and I just don’t understand. Perhaps their experiences or expectations are/were different from that of my own. For me at least, I can say enough good things about this device."
Susan G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My second paper white. Thought I had lost my first one so finally ordered another- then of course found the first three weeks later. Fired up right away. My kids will use it now. I use my kindle at night, traveling, on planes, at the beach, waiting for appointments, my constant companion. I also read print and paper books. Enjoy both."
J. Hilburn,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been a long time holdout to digital reading devices - until now. Recently went through a process of culling my bookshelves and this is now my “book” of choice. The paperwhite is user friendly and easy to read. It’s also lightweight and very potable. Will allow me to indulge my book addiction and my desire for simplicity and minimalism.
ML,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My old kindle was did not have enough memory, could not support my audio books, and was not as good a holding a charge- so I bought this as an upgrade. Syncing with my account was seamless- perfect!!! The screen seems to be to dark or too bright, I'm having a hard time finding the right setting. The battery life seems to be the same. The touch screen is much more responsive."
Jazzy Woman,5.0 out of 5 stars,I returned a gen 3 version (light built into the cover which you had to extend & keyboard on kindle) to receive a credit & 25% discount towards a new version. It's obviously lighter and smaller and a great touch screen which I'm still getting used to. Fits nicely into a handbag (Michael Kors size). Easy to get started. Best feature for me is the built in light which makes it easier reading in bed & when traveling.
Teri C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I read 4/5 hrs a day. Battery life last 3 days. I switched from a nook and absolutely love my kindle. Books are easily downloaded and pricing is comparable to other online book stores. The one thing I am not happy with is the on button being at the bottom of the kindle. It is easily put in sleep mode if I move to adjust my reading. I would like to see it on the upper side of the device. All in all very happy with it.
Fran,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked the old Kindle because it was so user friendly. Could move the books you've read into a 'read' file, leaving only those unread books on the home page. The Paper white jumbles them all together so that you have to look for books in your files that you have not read. Also a list of books showing titles and author is easier to read than pictures with the titles obscured, hard to read."
Cash99,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this Kindle. This is our third kindle.this one is my grandson's he is 11.He uses it every night.we have loves it so much.it is a much better choice for reading.
The Kindle previous version. is great for reading in bright day time. Not so good in the darkwe do most of our reading at night.So while both are good the paper white is better for us. I also like that the Kindle doesn't have blue light to keep from falling to sleep"
Squish,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I moved to the waterproof kindle as I like to read it in damp places (bought for me as a gift) - backpacking, hot tubs, and under the eaves while it rains. I also, of course, read in bed. Love my waterproof Kindle but for two things -
1) power button on the bottom - I can not count how many times I've shut off the kindle while reading in bed with it braced with my right hand holding it for page turning and bracing. Put it up on top, imho!
2) battery life isn't as good as my older generation device - I've had to reset it once as power was draining in a half day. still drains seemingly faster, but it's acceptable now. I haven't done a real side by side with the older one."
Courtney,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great battery life and screen! It’s the perfect size to fit in my purse and carry with me.

Only complaints is when I try to connect my Bluetooth headphones to listen to my Audible reads the quality is very staticy and bad. Not sure if it’s my headphones or the kindle but I don’t have that problem with listening paired with my phone. Not a big deal since I usually read rather than listen but just thought it would be good to know.

Also, the lock screen ALWAYS shows advertisements of books. A lot of times people will see the ad and think that’s the book I’m reading which isn’t always a positive thing depending on the advertisement."
bobopercy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"From my middle school, I have been a big fan of Kindle and using it almost every day. This newest version is a good choice for people who have PW2 and the former version to change. Unless you want to experience the ultimate experience with Oasis, this PW4 is your best choice.

One thing I feel bad about Amazon, they delivered my Kindle with a WHOLE package of IZZE water and my kindle was pressed under the 24 bottles of water without any protection. Even though this kindle wasn't damaged for now, it still made me feel bad and worry about if there may exist some problem later. :( Hope Amazon won't do it again"
ALEXA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow. I have been converted from someone who ""likes to hold, turn pages, and smell books"" to a ""kindle only"" person. The paperwhite is truly incredible and the battery lasts forever. It is super thin and light, perfect for commuting or reading at home. My *only* complaint is that there is a teeny tiny lag when you click to go to the next page."
Barbara G. Harris,3.0 out of 5 stars,I have owned Kindles since they first came out. The things I like about this paperwhite: thin profile and lightweight design. What I don’t like about it: it seems to take a long time to respond when looking up a word in the dictionary or switching between two books. The worst thing about it is having the power button on the bottom of the device! I hope in future versions they would put it anywhere else except the bottom of the device.
Diane W. Kryszczuk,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read a lot and I love the new paper white waterproof kindle. The Battery lasted almost a week if you turn off WiFi. The screen is bright and I love that you can turn the light down. I read in my pool everyday and love the fact that if it gets splashed it will be fine.
I recommend this kindle for people that read outdoors."
Sonoma Mann,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The ""Paperwhite"" Kindle e-reader is a device that time forgot. It .has a small, sad, dim gray screen floating in the middle of a mini-tablet-sized device, surrounded by inches of unusable bezel. It works well in the Amazon ecosystem, but so do the free and excellent Kindle apps for phones, tablets, and desktops/laptops. I am hugely disappointed. Battery life is stellar though."
Ao,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Im usually a physical book kind of girl, but carrying so many books became heavy & strenuous. I did my research and found the paper white to be the closest option to an actual book & I am very impressed! Absolutely love it and would recommend. As you can see with the picture attached it really looks like a page from a book. It’s not strenuous on your eyes either no blue light but still perfect for reading in the dark."
rita franco palazzo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been an avid reader for many years (I’m 79) and having as many as I had definitely took up lots of space it was an easy switch to an e-reader.
As the years progressed my hands have not been so kind. Switching to an e-reader (this one is my fourth) has given me easy access to something that I enjoy and purchasing books through the different venues a blessing.
I even save money because prices are definitely cheaper than hard cover or paperback books."
Chad,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My 2011 kindle keyboard started failing at the perfect time. The week of amazon prime day, my keyboard started to randomly reset itself everytime I woke it up. I took advantage of the prime sales and got a new paperwhite. The first one I received had a barely noticeable dead pixel. While it was superficial, I would have never been able to forget about it! The exchange process was fast and painless. The best thing about the paperwhite is the built-in lights! The only thing I miss about my kindle keyboard is that I was either to turn the page front or back, on both sides of the kindle. I hold it with my left hand and it would be a nice addition if I could turn the page forward on the left side. Maybe a software update could add this feature? Either way, I love it."
Karen G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this Kindle. The size for me is perfect. This is actually my 3rd Kindle, and this is by far my favorite. The build in light is so nice and easy to adjust for the setting your reading in. The price is excellent as well. I had a case that belonged to my 2nd Kindle (did not have a lighted screen), so I did not have to purchase another cover. However, I strongly recommend that you have a cover for your Kindle - it is a nice protector for it."
auburn,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the white screen and the readability of the text and the font options. However, I find the space around some controls too narrow, for example, the control to see all the titles, and space to move from one page of titles to another. Perhaps for the latter there could be a narrow free space on the laft and right sides.f"
Nichol Cassoni,5.0 out of 5 stars,"SO I have this already for myself and I have reviewed for me with flying colors I myself love it, however this is a gift for my BF who has a hard time seeing at night and with print. This is perfect as the back light is terrific (and isolated to the screen) as needed and automatic. He can also adjust the font size, type, and switch from black to white background."
jvana15,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this December 2018, and it is April 25, 2019 and it completely froze up last night. I purchased the warranty, but not sure who to contact or what to do to unfreeze the kindle.
I would not purchase this again, since it is unusable at this time. Fortunately I have another kindle e-reader that I purchased in 2017 and it is still working."
Joseph L. Gartner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A few years ago I tried ebooks on my laptop but didn't like them. This year, for Xmas, my son bought my wife and I a Kindle Paperwhite. So far I've read two books on it and its great. I like being able to adjust font, light, and etc. I like that it automatically saves my place. The screen is very easy on my older eyes. Light weight. No more bulky piles of books.... Very long battery life."
Prplhall,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have two candles from the one that started out heavy to this nice lightweight one I love that the battery life is so much longer and I like that just by shutting the case it save my spot and turns off pretty impressed with this and I like the size and portability and of course I got it in purple my favorite color. Would definitely think about purchasing another one of these.
Kattie Moua,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really nervous about buying a Kindle as I love reading from regular books. After several reviews, I decided to take a chance on this Kindle. I am so glad that I did! I love how light it is and how I can put it in my bag or purse without adding a ton on extra weight. The touch screen lags a little and sometimes I have to press really hard (almost tapping it) to get it to do what I want, but overall it's minor and manageable. I've only had it for one week so I haven't been able to explore all the features, but I love it so far. Highly recommend."
TK,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It seems that my wife has had many problems with the Paper white, causing me to have to reset it several times. It doesn't seem to remember where she was in a book and turns itself off without her touching the power button. This is like the fifth Kindle that I have bought her and all of them have failed, usually just after the warranty period."
LuvMyKindle67,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an avid reader, I really enjoy the Kindle products. This is my 3rd Kindle in about 7 years. I love having the ability to hold hundreds of books in one hand - you never know what reading mood you may be in. I love the paperwhite backlight. The non glare screen has always been a favorite feature. Being waterproof is an extra bonus, I won't be as paranoid about being in the pool. It is rare that I ever leave my house without my Kindle, as you never know when you are going to need it. Fits easily in most purses."
ken,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the waterproof Kindle Paperwhite to use by the pool and at the lake. I have not tested nor do I plan to test the claim of waterproofing, but the product functions, just not well. The lag is horrible while turning pages and while attempting to navigate the other functions. My wife and I have owned 5 other Kindles and have enjoyed them. This particular Kindle has left me disappointed. I'm sure my new Kindle is just one of the random defective devices out of the factory. I work in manufacturing so I understand defects happens. Amazon has always been a great customer service company so I'm sure they would replace it."
Susan K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an older one and wanted to upgrade. Got the bigger memory. Its just a touch different in size and will not fit in my old case...so be sure you order the correct case for the model Kindle you have. As soon as I registered it, everything from my older one transferred over to the new one. Glad I got the new one!"
Angela e. Terry,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to free up some space on my iPad. Overall I am happy with the purchase, I just wished the OS had some features that are with the OS Kindle app for the iPad. I am also disappointed that the screen is not in color; I know I am just reading text but I would like to see the book covers in color.

UPDATE: The touchscreen is a little slow when it comes to highlighting text and typing in notes is downright frustrating. Battery life is AWESOME!!!"
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my paperwhite. Meets every requirement for me. I read between 50-70 books per year and the greyscale makes it much easier on my eyes.

The reason I only gave 4 rather than 5 stars is because 2 days after I bought this version, Amazon put the bigger version with 4 times the storage space on sale for just about the same price. That was sneaky Amazon!!!"
h.a.87,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First time Kindle user. I always read books in my iPhone and wow. Kindle rocks! Couple of useful things to know:

- it fits on your back pocket of your pants perfectly. (Guys pants, I should say)

- I didn’t know how e-ink works. The screen does that flashing thing when turn pages etc. I thought there was something wrong. It’s not. That’s how it works and it’s the way you get that paper like look.

- it doesn’t tire your eyes at all like reading on an iPhone.

- the whole reading experience is amazing. It’s really close to holding an actual book without the bulkiness of the book. It’s especially great when you read in subway.

- it helped me to get back to reading regularly. I keep finding myself reading at night instead of watching mindless tv."
Livy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third kindle, I had the first and second generation. I had to get a new one, as the battery was not holding a charge very long anymore. I love this paperwhite! It is a lot brighter and lighter. It took a while for me to figure out the navigation, but it was not difficult."
Mary D,5.0 out of 5 stars,Be careful so you don't accidentally purchase a book you don't mean to buy. Amazon was on the spot when I contacted them and promptly processed a refund. Very happy with this Kindle. I usr this to borrow books from my library which I previously borrowed on my tablet. I only wish I didn't have load it to my phone and Bluetooth it over. Maybe there is a way that I don't know about?
Michael McCormack,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second new kindle and it had the same issue as the first after only a month. The built in light remains a dull yellow like an old book no matter what setting number you put it on. I would recommend keeping the old one. On a side note the first one happened in less then a month and they tried to replace it with a refurbished one, in other words I paid full price for a refurbished item. They did send a new one and same problem."
Mt. MacMan,3.0 out of 5 stars,I had high hopes this would be a wonderful upgrade from my 5 year old paperwhite but the unfortunate truth is that all the added features do not make up for the glitching touch screen and stuttering page turns. It is on its way back to Amazon and I’ll stick with my reliable paperwhite. Upgrades should be improvements and not loose the basic functions for fancier but not necessary features.
Steph ABC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first ereader. I have previously used the Kindle app to read on my phone, and I realize it's probably not fair to compare the two experiences, but I have been a little disappointed in the responsiveness of the touchscreen and the quality of the light. I've been very pleased with the battery life, though, i have had it 2 weeks, used it almost daily, and have not charged it yet."
M. Ferguson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd kindle over many many years. My older model started to have battery issues (shortened life) and I decided to go ahead and treat myself to an upgrade! Love the lights. Still lightweight, easy to use and perfect for those who like to read. I have not had a Kindle I haven't loved, ever! So go ahead, treat yourself or a loved one."
Joyce Fuhr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read daily and this Kindle is wonderful. Even though I'm not the most ""tech"" savy senior, I am loving it. I like not needing to have a light on to read in bed. I usually read myself to sleep and it's so easy to just close the kindle and nod off. I like being able to take it with me to appointments, etc."
Nilda,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the kindle book. Bit better than buying books and reading it a few times and stop. I can pick the book I want. When I finish reading take it of my kindle and pick a new one. It have lots of options than bookstores and the library. Some books sells for cheap when downloading than paper. And there are other books are free.
Artist in the Hood,5.0 out of 5 stars,"All my life I have read in the bathtub. Yes, I ruin books but I like books. I thought I would hate reading the kindle in the bathtub but it turns out that I much prefer it to a paper book.

This is my 4th kindle and I do not like the interface as much as #2 - before it all got fancy - and sometimes the page will advance without me swiping but still, for the price, it is so worth it!"
Wolfsph,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always enjoyed to read at bedtime, however I couldn’t fall asleep either because of the background lighting or the lamp...
However, since I have the Kindle Paperwhite, at bedtime I invert the paper colors to black and white in the Accessibility settings, so I can read as much as I feel like without worrying about not being able to fall asleep afterwards.
It’s also great to have so many books available without having to carry their weight.
The only trick thing is to use its touch screen when in VoiceView mode...
I already bought another Kindle Paperwhite to my family.
We highly recommend it!"
Bill S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Paperwhite for reading. My disappointment with the current version is the inability to accept an audio book from the public library. The ability to play a recorded book is limited to a subscription to Audible and the purchase of books. I was hoping to use the expanded feature without attaching to another service.
Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Never having had an e-reader, this thing is awesome! It is responsive, intuitive, and compact (sometimes it's so light I forget it's in my pocket). The backlight reminds me of the old indiglo Timex watches; it is uniform and illuminates the entire screen evenly and the adjustable brightness is a great feature so you don't scald your retinas while reading in the dark. The pixel density is also amazing... The words are nearly indistinguishable from printed letters. It's quite amazing. And I received my Kindle as an early Christmas gift the day after Thanksgiving. I have only charged it twice in 4 weeks (and the second time was entirely unnecessary, I just plug everything in to charge before traveling.)"
D. Maxwell,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Slow, buggy. I've had several Kindles, going back to the first model. This one is genuinely the worst I've had. Slow to wake, and often freezes and lags."
SarBear,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE THIS THING. I left my first one on an airplane and am leaving to go on vacation next week. The airline is still looking but I cant wait. I bought another one and if the first one is found I will just gift it.

I have read more since buying a Kindle than I have in years. Easy on the eyes - battery lasts for ever. Downloading books is a breeze."
Patrick I.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, this device was awful for us. The first unit we received hung up during setup and stopped responding altogether. The recommended remedy to reset it seemed to have bricked it. Thankfully Amazon sent a replacement. The replacement unit was able to make it past setup but very sluggish. Ultimately it also stopped responding. I don't think it was our use as we have several iPads, Android tablets, and laptops that have worked for years without issue. We even have a tablet with phone capabilities that cost less than this did. We just decided not worth trouble and returned everything."
Margaret A. Baker,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my first Kindle. It’s so light and small. I just love it. I needed something that I could use on the beach and outside. It works perfect. It’s like using a paper book. I have had no problems yet downloading any book. I’m very pleased. I have only had it for a month so I guess the jury is still out. But right now the verdict is wonderful!!
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this as an as an alternative to reading on my tablet. I like everything about it; the adjustable backlight, the adjustable font, the fact that you can easily hold it with one hand. The battery life is good too. If you like to read, you need to get inevif these."
cdwlarson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the long battery life but can’t stand that you’ll be in the middle of reading and it will log you out to the home screen to push an update. And it happens all the time. Why can’t we set it to update when it’s not being used. Anyway, if the battery life wasn’t what it is, I’d dump this in a minute."
CheerMomMT,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I just upgraded to the Kindle Paperwhite version 10 (2018) from the version 7. I like the size, weight, and storage capacity. Unfortunately, the touch screen doesn't work as well for me although I'm sure I can figure out how to make it work better.

The system doesn't go to sleep right without a case or either of the 2 cases I've used. Now, I have to turn the screen off manually EVERY time I stop using it. Otherwise, the battery drains and the battery doesn't stay charged as long as my v7 device even in airplane mode.

I wouldn't purchase this particular model of the Paperwhite again. If you are looking to purchase a Kindle, wait until the next hardware revision. Maybe they'll fix these issues in the next version."
Me,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Product is terrible. On/off button located directly in holding position. Inadvertently turns off constantly. Product design is terrible, I hoped case would rectify situation and protect on /off button from inadvertant shut offs. Unfortunately case does not improve situation. Two chances, both failed. Ridiculous to not design on/off at top of device."
Rubark Established 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was always skeptical and hesitant about trying any form of e-books and e-readers. I have always preferred an actual paper edition as it helped me comprehend the content better. I decided to give the Kindle a try considering how well known it is. I made the right choice! It truly gives the impression of reading an actual book with the adjustable white color settings for the screen.
SSN,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light options for the screen are great but a little difficult to find the black screen/white print for reading at night in bed. Battery life is longer and it is light weight so carrying it in my purse is a breeze. Sometimes it is a little difficult to find books in the library but i now have it down! Enjoy!
Gomojo99,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Won't go into everything but this is junk. 1st one reboots randomly back to square one every 15 mins. Complete junk. 2nd replacement and it does the same thing. Complete junk X2. Jeff, forget about flying Blue Origin to Mars and spend your profits on your customers. JEFF<> HELP ME PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Amber,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Top review mentioned a pinhole and go figure I have two. This product is too expensive (especially with the extra cost of removing ads smh) to have this -apparently common- issue. I gave three stars because for a device where you’re constantly staring at the screen, this can be extremely annoying for many people."
Ayana,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loooove my kindle! This is the first e-reader I’ve ever owned. At first I was pretty apprehensive because I was worried I wouldn’t like reading on a screen. The way the kindle is backlit makes it easy on the eyes. The screen resolution is great. I love the convenience of its size... sometimes, depending on where I’m going, I don’t always want to bring a huge book in a small bag with me. I also spend a lot of time commuting by bus and train, so it’s nice to be able to bring books with me regardless of the size of the bag I happen to have with me that day. The battery life is great, I’ve only had to charge it once in the several weeks that I’ve had it. Overall it’s been a great addition to my lifestyle."
Daniel C,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have nothing but great things to say about the Kindle Paperwhite. One of my favorite things about the Kindle is being able to read longer without feeling eye fatigue. It’s a very easy to use device and makes reading ultra convenient. Strong battery life as well. I feel it’s definitely worth the price.
Casey66421,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot believe how small this Kindle is. Having seen other family members Kindle, I thought this was going to be comparable to theirs but apparently I didn’t read the fine print on the size of the actual unit it’s about the size of a 4 x 6 photo. This would make it easy to travel with but yourself turning the pages a lot more often due to its small size."
B.W.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The button design is very sensitive that could be clicked accidentally very easily that puts the device unintentionally to sleep mode. Unlike the previous generation, the button of 10th generation is less flatten. As holding the device in one hand, a slight pinky finger touch could put the device into sleep mode. Very annoying ."
Sue,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say? I have had a Kindle since they were first introduced ( and cost me about $500-$600!). One of the best inventions ever. I love to read and with this, it is easy to throw into a purse or into a suitcase or in a backpack and you will always have plenty to read. Buy it...you cannot go wrong."
Joseph K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've long been a fan of Kindle Readers since my wife gave me one for my birthday. At first I wasn't sure I would like it as I really like the look and feel of reading a real book. But, I quickly realized the advantages of the Kindle: easy access to more books that I could ever read; able to get all the books in a series; easily discover new writers not in book stores; very portable; able to read it in the dark; and many more. A major advantage is that my home office is not filling up with paperbacks anymore!
Overall, I like the new paperwhite very much. One minor dislike: The new deep sleep mode that helps extend battery life results in a little longer wakeup time."
Readergirl22,5.0 out of 5 stars,"While I use my phone and the Kindle app to read while waiting on lines in stores, etc., I use my Kindle reader all the time. What's not to like? This version is solid."
Mitzi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Actually, it's my Kindle #3. I have one of the original KIndles (#1), and an earlier Paperewhite (#2). Using it doesn't appear any different than #2. I wanted the additional storage capacity. I'm putting all my fiction and ""secular"" stuff on #3 and the rest on #2. I don't mind carrying around two Kindles … still smaller than one paperback … and all my books are in my bag!"
J C,4.0 out of 5 stars,This paperwhite is nice and works well. The reason for only 4 stars is the slow to load when i open the cover and it doesn't like to take me to the farthest page read when i read on my iphone.
Bonnie Irwin,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I prefer a Kindle to reading on an iPad, but I find the thing freezes too easily, is a pain to restart, and will not attach to Wi-Fi if the log-on process is even a little complex, which makes loading new content impossible many places. It is also more difficult to toggle between books, and it does not show percentage read on the page with the text. There is very little I like about this device other than the size and weight."
Mbeth,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle works fine. I'm adjusting to the smaller size from my previous Kindle. (screen is the same size) It will be easier to pack when traveling but seems less comfortable for me to hold.
Also, I do not like the Home page. You have to scroll to Your Library to see the books you currently have downloaded as the Home page includes too much other ""stuff"" like: Your Reading Lists and Monthly Reading Summary and This Year in Books 2018...."
D. McNeese,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently purchased a Kindle Paperwhite to use while reading outside where the sun's glare makes phones and tablets unusable. It is excellent for that; however, the Kindle reacts much more slowly than the phone or tablet to swipes and presses. The worst part is that several of the Kindle books I purchased, which read perfectly on my phone and tablet, are incompatible with my Paperwhite. Why should the Kindle version of a book not work on a Kindle?"
Savanna seat,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great overall, but some other features would make it a lot better. It doesn't have inverted colors (where you can read white letters on a black background, for night time), the touchscreen responsiveness is a bit louzy, opening things and maneuvering in the Kindle (even offline) is slower than I am used to with an iPhone. That being said, the waterproof feature is wonderful, the Kindle charges quickly, the battery lasts a long time when offline, clear screen, blacklight can be turned up or down, so many good things to say about this Kindle!"
55sgrandma,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I like that it has a light but it’s not user friendly like my old kindle. I could see my library and could see what I already read and find my new books easily.
I really wished I had just gone back and bought one like I had. I"
ellen a.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this as a present and I absolutely love it. I have a iPad and wear glasses. There is a difference in reading the kindle compared to my iPad books. It is easier on my eyes , and I want to read more like I could when I was younger, and couldn’t put a book down. What is really nice is the built in light, so you can read in the dark. I would of never bought this thinking I all ready have a iPad to read with, and that would be silly. The best Christmas present ever!"
Stephanie,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this Kindle; I disliked it that much. This is my fourth Kindle and I disliked the new menus and layout. I disliked that it kept asking me if I wanted to get out of ""airplane mode"" and if I wanted to ""sync"". Stop...I let you know! So back to my older Kindle easier to use by a factor of 10. I'll wait until another major menu change."
Elizabeth Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought as a gift for the husband who loves to read in the pool. Great clarity even in bright sun. First battery charge lasted 5 weeks. He is very pleased.
Kristyn Brophy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so upset when my first generation kindle keyboard finally bit the dust back in the fall. I received this kindle for Christmas as a replacement and I couldn't be happier! My love for reading has been rejuvenated and I even signed up for kindle unlimited to pair well with my new kindle. I also have the matching cover from Amazon, and love that the kindle automatically goes to sleep/wakes from sleep when I open the cover. It really helps to save the battery life. My only thing is that I wish the built-in light on the screen would do better with automatically adjusting to the external light. Sometimes it is too bright in dim settings, but it's not really a big issue."
Azn user 007,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like that it has one seamless surface that is water proof, a great improvement than the previous generation. It’s relatively lighter a bit smaller than the previous generation. The screen is too wide to allow one hand to reach the whole keyboard. Received it by mailing in my old one and received a 25% discount."
David W,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Only a bit smaller and thinner than earlier Paperwhites enough to necessitate a new cover (I recommend the Moko for table top, lap, and one handed reading). Not as small as the now discontinued Voyage (my favorite albeit short lived) and too large to fit the Voyage origami cover (the best Kindle cover I've come across). As with earlier Kindles (I've owned five different models), battery life is short: a couple of days or roughly 15 hours--not the weeks claimed by Amazon."
Avid reader,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this paperwhite kindle for reading. It has lasted two years now, and I have hundreds of books stored on it. The paperwhite is nice if you read a lot because it doesn't hurt your eyes, and it functions and adjusts in any type of lighting conditions. So far, the battery has stayed charged for at least a week or two at a time. Great little gadget."
Kindra,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new paperwhite, mostly due to the increased storage capacity. I have had a kindle for 10 years, and this is my 3rd (2nd paperwhite). I upgraded due to lack of sufficient storage to carry all my books. I like to be able to read whatever I want, whenever I want, without having to worry about downloading my book each time and then removing it from the device. If you don't have a lot of ebooks, maybe the extra storage isn't a big deal, but to me it's a game changer!"
Keri (Twilighter1981),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love my new Paperwhite. I have the original Paperwhite. It’s still working but it’s heavier. I played with a demo and fell in love with the new one. I left off one star because I want immersion reading. I want to read and listen to audio at the same time. Not switch from one to the other. Once that is an option, it’ll have a 5 star rating from me forever. I adore and love my kindle."
Stevi,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Will not to 5G WiFi. Have to connect via hotspots. Attempted all solutions via help info.

Device is small and fit my had well. Battery last a long time. Touch screen is sensitive.

I owned several kindle/fire tablets that were better.

If you have 5G don’t waste your money. I would return but threw away the package."
S. K. Lowry,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this product for plane travel because it's much lighter than the tablet I've been using for my books. Unfortunately, about half of my books are audio-only, and I was unable to pair bluetooth earbuds to the Kindle. I also found the screen not very responsive to my touch, making it difficult to do things like switch between e-books. Overall, I was disappointed with this purchase."
Lola Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an older version of the paper white which was perfect except it was not water proof, so I purchased the Oasis for around and in my pool. The oasis was larger and not as comfortable to hold, it also got over heated out in the sun, so I traded the Oasis for the new paper white to replace the Oasis. It is perfect!"
Larry,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Oddly, I recently received my new waterproof paperwhite, but it came with a USB charging cable in the same sealed package that would not fully push into the unit! (Yes, I did try flipping the plug over!) Luckily, I had a cable for an old Paperwhite that works just fine and Amazon is sending me a free replacement cable. All else OK...so far."
john,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using a Nook that my wife bought me about 5 years ago. I got her a paperwhite a while back and loved it. So when my Nook started acting up I ordered the paperwhite. I really like it!! The backlit screen is wonderful as I am 73 years old and my eyes aren't what they used to be. Also....Great price for Christmas. Thanks Amazon!!
Tim G,2.0 out of 5 stars,"You would think that this day in age they could get Bluetooth right, but somehow that skill has escaped them. Every time I try to listen to an Audible book I have to turn Bluetooth off and then on again before it will connect. You think they could fix this and upgrade the software over the air, but that too seems to be beyond their skill set."
H M E,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So pleased with my new Kindle - I love them all - have 3 Kindles plus this one and two Kindle Fires,
The best features are the built in light and the longer lasting battery.
I think I am finally done buying Kindles! I loan mine to family to enjoy some of my books.
Thank you for a great product."
GeeMeg,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought because I a mb a gravewatx shift nurse. Wanted convenience of not lugging a book everywhere. I downloaded Steven King book, whi h is long. A few weeks later the download disappeared and I was not anywhere finished. Tried to reload the book & cannot. No one to guide me. Now I have an electronic device that is useless
Quite honestly. It would have been easier to stick to the hard-copy book."
AM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love my paperwhite. Since I got it I've read 7 books. The interface is very easy to understand and has common sense controls. Battery life is very long. In fact, that is one of the main selling points in my opinion. If you turn off the backlight so the screen has no glow, the device can last 1.5 to 2 weeks and sometimes more on one charge, depending on how much you read, obviously. It's also a nice size and fits in most pockets and is very portable and necessarily so. The device is waterproof too and can be submerged completely with absolutely no adverse effects."
ipse dixit,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have several Kindles, and I use them all at various times. I got this one because my original Paperwhite has been passed on to hubby. So far, so good. I haven't tried the Audible content on it yet, but I have high hopes..."
Pan C,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded my Kindle to this version for Audible for road trips. Unfortunately, it's easier to exchange CDs in an audiobook than to come up with the magical formula for connecting to the Bluetooth on my car. On top of that, if I've managed to connect it to the car and I make a pit stop on my travels, I have to try to reconnect it when I start up the car again. Too much trouble. Connecting it is not much easier with a portable speaker at home . . .
As for reading, it's fine and nice for traveling. Still, it's not as easy to hold as a book - even with a cover."
Cher Carter,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindles are great but I made the mistake of buying one with ""special features"" for a friend. Instead of the simple, logical home page I get on mine without those ""special features"", she is stuck with a page of Amazon ads. Had I paid enough attention to realize that ""special features"" means ads, I would happily have paid the extra $20 for a regular kindle."
Gloria,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I keep having issues trying to link my earphones. I like the audiobooks but, I don’t like that you can’t see the letters of the book. I like to view the book and hear the audio but, I’ve been having issues with that too! :( i just thought I would
Enjoy it more than I’m actually
Enjoying it."
Lorraine Cameron,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Able to read outdoors in sun. My IPAD overheated, but Kindle is fine for Florida sun by my pool."
Dennis Miller,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is very easy to use. Features I use the most are adjustment of the font size and the adjustment of the brightness.
Great storage capacity. I have over a dozen books stored on it. Amazon delivers the books very quickly and with high speed internet I can download them in less than one minute."
ali,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant to buy a kindle because I already have an iPad and I read from it. But lately when I started reading more, my eyes wouldn't tolerate half an hour -at max- for reading session! That's why I bought the kindle and boy it's one of my best purchases I have ever made. I recently converted to mostly E-books because I travel a lot and run out of space for books anyways and the kindle is the perfect solution for these problems. The screen is almost exactly like a paper and even at night when I turn up the brightness it's quite gentle on the eyes and I can read comfortably from it. Highly recommend the paperwhite over any other kindle because of how convinent it's and it's value for the money."
Paul Deyoung,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle and as the headline suggests, it is the best yet. Light, easy to hold and turn pages, simple to use, amazing capacity, doesn't hurt when you drop it on your chest as sleep overcomes your desire to read....what's not to love!"
Ed O'Connell,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice product, but Amazon feels they must continuously advertise other books when turning the Kindle on 'n off. I tremendously DISLIKE having ads shoved down my gullet with no way to turn 'em off, especially since I paid for the damned thing. I may switch to a different device if I can't figure out how to do my own screen."
Jonathan D'Rozario,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this thinking that I was going to love this product. Certainly the last thing I expected was for the battery to be what let me down - marketed as lasting weeks, instead of hours, I was extremely excited. Trust me, It lasts hours, and that's even in it's powered down state. I don't know whether I have a faulty model, or if there was fine print I didn't read, but it's so non-functional that I've given up and gone back to paper books. Maybe I'll go Fahrenheit 451 on this thing to see if I can derive some form of pleasure from it, although I'm fairly certain that would only make it stronger. Thanks for literally nothing, Amazon."
amagicub,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Am pleased with this kindle; it's no larger than my first kindle which I am satisfied. Easy to set up the audio listening and even though I'm hard of hearing, no problem with the sound. Nice, loud and clear just on 1x volume level. It's accurate when I switch from listening to reading choice. Best of all, I can turn off the kindle to save battery although turning on bluetooth needs my wi-fi for listening. But otherwise the battery life consumes very little compare to cellphones. I can read/listen to a book or two, before charging. That's a lot of hours indeed!"
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Kindle Paper White replaced my old one because it has twice the storage and I could no longer use the old one. The battery on the old one was good, however the new one is even better. It is so worth the money that I paid for it."
Tatevik Ohanyan,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this new generation kindle paper white for my mother. She is absolutely happy with it. This one is a bit lighter and thinner than the older model of paper white that I have. Also screen brightness is a little bit different from the old model. You can still change brightness so it better fits to your eyes. Even though I bought the one with special offers adds are not too intrusive since they appear only when kindle is off and never disturb you during reading. Anyways I'd like adds to be removed without paying extra money for that :)
Isaac,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Very small screen, very bad UI, touch screen responsiveness isn’t good either.

Sometimes you just get really spoiled by Apple products but don’t know it until you try something else. Those are my big complaints. Having a waterproof device just for reading is worth the price. I’m enjoying for the most part. Love how light it is."
D. Graf,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I have been very pleased with the new Kindle. The visibility is excellent in all kinds of light and the battery life Is great. I can go a week or two without needing a recharge. I had been using the Fire HD8 to read books and have always not liked the glare, so when Prime Day came this year, I purchased the new Kindle."
M. Ervin,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been buying Kindles since they first came out and am very happy with them. I needed however a lightweight one for carrying with me to Dr's apt's. This one more than met my needs. Light in my purse and doesn't stress my hands or wrists holding it for long periods. Best of all I don't need internet address to read it.
arlene wyer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Unlike the original kindle you it does not allow you to adjust the print to at least the size of the original kindle. It goes to 14. I can still read without reading glasses but not as good . The reason I like the kindle is so I can adjust the reading to what I want. As a result I'm back to the original kindle which I love but is very old. For the most part I read from hd fire.
Also it is hard to see the books in balck and white. I hate this reader!"
MCS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have thought for years that I would not like a Kindle. The new Kindle that I just ordered is smaller in size so you can really take it anywhere and it is simply great. I love the ability to order books right on the Kindle, to include pre-orders. I can adjust the print and the built in light lets you read anywhere!! What a fabulous product."
Fircrestshooter,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally convinced my wife to try using the Kindle. She absolutely loves it. We got this one for her based on a recommendation from a work mate. She is very happy with the choice. After using her iPad to read on, she chooses the Kindle every time. She can use it for days without needing a recharge."
Tim Lane,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i love everything about my Kindle Paperwhite. from the touch screen to the back light, not to mention the water resistance. absolutely one of the best products i have purchased."
Robin M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great when you can read without a light on. Perfect for reading without light
Christopher,5.0 out of 5 stars,The wife loves it so I love it
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this specifically for night reading in the hope it would be easier on my eyes than simply reading on a phone or tablet with the background set to black and text set to white. Unfortunately, it is not easier on the eyes at night, even at low backlight settings.

Otherwise it is nice and what I expected. However, if you are considering this specifically for night reading, consider carefully. There may be better options."
piratepixels,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It took me over 2 hours to setup the Amazon kindle as there were issues with the account which kept showing me Amazon Japan store instead of the US store where most of the books bought were. I got into the chat for help, and the agent was friendly but the issue wasn't resolved even though we were on chat for a long time. It kept going back to the Japan store. Finally he said he wanted to call me so that we could resolve the issue quickly. I gave him an overseas mobile number, and he wasn't able to call out too. So I gave him my hotel phone number, and for some unknown reason, he wasn't able to get through. Finally he gave me an Amazon number to call, and when I tried to call the message was that it was an unknown number that cannot be dialled through. When I indicated my frustrations, the problem was resolved within the next minute."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not quite what I was hoping for. It is good for reading. The screen is easy to read & easy on the eyes. I wish it was able to download another reading app because I like to borrow books from an online library. I am able to borrow books & send them to the Kindle, but wish I could do it all on one device. Maybe I should have bought the Kindle Fire insread?"
lisa s,2.0 out of 5 stars,"so what i really like about it is that you can easily read while someone else is sleeping and don't have to worry about night lights not reaching your book. what is really disturbing is that if I take it to the gym put it on the elliptical or treadmill, and leave it on the shelf of the equipment, the vibration hits the on/off switch hich is on the bottom of the device and turns it off on an ongoing basis. very frustrating.
also may too many adverts."
Not so Happy buyer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My first e-reader, so no prior experience to compare. The text clarity is perfect. The touchscreen response is a bit sluggish compared to powerful laptops. Have not cycled thru a full battery charge, but with about two hours of use per day, its down to 60% after 5 days. The BIGGEST issue I have with the Whitepaper is the placement of the power button on the bottom of the device; cradling it in my right hand while reading places the power
button on top of my pinky finger and frequently inadvertently switches it off. (See Photo) Would have given it 5 stars if not for this niggling issue."
pat brown,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not at all satisfied with new kindle paperwhite. Had to return because it was freezing. Would be reading screen would go blank would havr to reboot. Returned instead of them sending new kindle they state they fixed.
Melanie B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the Kindle for Christmas from my husband along with the leather case. I will say that it is an amazing product! I have only had to charge it twice since christmas and I use it almost every day. The adjustable back light is a nice feature for dark days or at night. I refuse to test the waterproof feature for obvious reasons, but everything else is awesome! Five star for sure!"
KAC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an avid reader and my husband and I travel a great deal. This is my second kindle paperwhite. My first lasted 6 years and I loved it. This version is slightly smaller and lighter. It seems to be a bit brighter, is very easy to use, convenient for travel and I like the fact that it is waterproof. I've had it at the beach and pool and although I've been careful not to get it I am confident it will work just fine if it does get wet. I love this and am glad I got it!!"
Amber,4.0 out of 5 stars,Unit was smaller than I anticipated and doesn't quite fit the case I bought for it. Did not realize it's black and white only. Good for the unit and provided as promised once the listing was re-examined. Would probably have preferred a tablet or larger unit with color. I do enjoy that it is waterproof and it responds very easily to touch. Still at 89% battery life after 3 weeks (though I haven't read much from it yet).
Lmurph,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite is my first e-reader and its been terrific. I read a lot but have always preferred to read real books. I finally decided to try an e-reader when the Paperwhite was on such a great sale on Prime Day. It's small size means it slips into my purse easily and doesn't weigh me down. I have experienced less eye strain, particularly when reading at night. The battery life has been good as I typically can read 3-4 books before having to charge the device. I have not taken the Kindle on a trip yet but can't wait to bring along multiple books without all the weight."
LK,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It has been ten years since the last kindle I have. I don't see much of improvement here. I am really surprised to see the bluish backlight on ""paperwhite"". Matt finish screen looks blurry with backlight on. Software is the same as before. Touch screen actually feels worse than buttons.
Only thing I like is the light weight."
Ive S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to love this kindle but the truth is that it is barely ""okay"". The touchscreen ia not good and the bluetooth feature is terrible! It does not connect about 75% of the time and also does not work well with earbuds. I enjoy using it in bed at night so I will not be returning ot but I also would not recommend it."
Geri Spieler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first needed a new Kindle, I didn't get the one with the white screen. So at night, I had to use a reading lamp. Not very practical. So, finally, as we are going on a long trip, I want to be able to read it without a book lamp, and this Paperwhite is perfect. Really enjoying the convenience."
CKreuger,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my first kindle as a Christmas gift when I was 16, ten years later it was no longer functional. I ordered this kindle as a Christmas present to myself this past December, and I love it. If you have one of the more recent versions, this one may not have a ton of new and exciting updates, but moving from my ten year old one to this one has been so awesome! Touch screen, water resistant, and backlit! Love it!"
Rebecca Wilburn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have literally not charged this for 2 months and still has 40% battery although i will say i do not heavily read on it as i do read books too. But the fact that if it was any other type of electronic, even just sitting and not being used the batteries can still run down, since there are no notifications and screen sleeps it is not dead yet."
Sharon Rekuc,2.0 out of 5 stars,I do not like this at all. I cannot find a case it fits and when I put the page display on “page” it changes when I shut the kindle. I loved my first kindle;?this one not at all
dobetter,4.0 out of 5 stars,Improved lighting is nice and seems a little more responsive than my old Paperwhite. My only complaint is that the surface seems to show finger prints/skid marks much more that my old Kindle. I find myself frequently wiping away finger marks.
Jennifer Laslie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a 5th or 6th generation Paperwhite and needed to upgrade. I've always loved the Paperwhite, so it was a no-brainer. This thing holds a charge for weeks and I love that it can travel in my purse with thousands of books on it! Anytime any of my friends are looking for an ereader, I point them to the Paperwhite."
Cori,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If I had known that games couldn’t be played on the new Kindle Paperwhite Generation 10, I would have hesitated to buy it. I purchased the one with 32 gigs thinking I would have room for books AND games but then found out that the system doesn’t accept games. I play some word games, solitaire, and and just purchased sudoku but now know I can’t use them. I’ll be checking into whether the Kindle can be returned. I had purchased a Kindle Fire but didn’t use it so I gave to family member. At $160, I don’t want this new Paperwhite to go the same way."
J. Harris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My children gave me the Kindle Paper White for my birthday even though I already had a Kindle from years ago. This Paper White is so much lighter weight, the screen is back lit and it is so much smaller ,it fits in my tote easily. I am still working through all the functions but it is easy to find my library of books and to order new one. I love it."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted only 3 months past its return date. Won't charge! Now amazon isnt taking phone calls. Ridiculous!
Kim Wentworth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I switched to another device but was never happy with the battery life, the weight, or the view. When it ultimately failed, I was happy to go back to a Paperwhite (incidentally, I had thought my first one had died but it woke right up when I charged it, but I decided to get the newer model instead!)"
Wine lover,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have read books from the library on my I Pad for many years. My husband got me this Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas and I love it. The size is small to fit my purse and rests comfortably in my hands for reading. I was afraid that it would be harder to read because of the smaller size, but it has been perfect. The battery life is long and I only recharged it once during the reading of a large novel. This is a great way to read at home or on the go."
Texas Girl,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My previous kindle I could order books from it almost anywhere, this I cannot, so I miss that feature. It also has to” wake up” when you first open it and that is frustrating, Pages are a tad slow to turn. The screen is clear and very easy to read. The battery life is very good, it definitely holds a charger longer than previous kindle. I do like that it water resistant and I no longer ha e to put it in a plastic baggie to read in the pool. In retrospect after experiencing the this kindle having to wake up I would have kept my previous kindle I would have kept my previous kindle (unfortunately I opted to trade it in)"
KayJay T.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really love this Kindle. It's wonderful for reading. However, it's difficult to pull down the settings bar without accidentally turning pages. That's quite frustrating, so I'm only giving four stars as it makes it difficult to switch books, change the lighting, turn on airplane mode, etc. But the actual reading is beautiful on this screen. The battery lasts an amazing amount of time. And water proof is the icing on the cake."
Tom Knights,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this reader!! It's amazing to me that this small device will store thousands of books. I bought the leather cover for it and enjoy the small size, light weight and readability. It's perfect for travel and stays charged for weeks. Nothing I dislike about it.
Highly recommend...it replaces an older Kindle and I had no problem transferring my library from old to new."
E. Campbell,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had my old Kindle for 8 years and loved it so maybe I'm set in my ways. I don't care for the home page and the library set up. I'm sure I'll get used to it. But the battery lasting weeks is totally false... It lasts two days, tops. That's with me reading for a few hours and then shutting it off for the rest of the time."
NjRaeRae,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got this for my husband as a gift. I bought the refurbished one because we thought we was going out of town for like 6 months. And you cant even tell. He loves it. And its easier for us to get some hard to find books
RG,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my new Paperwhite. I had the previous model but wanted to upgrade to the waterproof one. I am very happy that I did. It was perfect for my beach vacation. It has a great battery life and holds all of the books I could want.
couponista,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I just sent back my generation 3 using the trade-in program. Big mistake, I should have kept my generation 3 until I received this new one and got to try it out. I am very disappointed in the dimness of this product, I have it turned up as bright as it will go and it just completely lacks the crisp, easy reading of my generation 3. The font appears gray, no matter how large you make it. I thought being able to listen to audio books would be nice with the Bluetooth feature, but the poor reading quality is not worth it. I read more books than listen to them. And the power button sticking out at the bottom...what were they thinking? The battery life is a joke. I feel this latest version was a push to sell more Audible books."
solera,3.0 out of 5 stars,I decided to upgrade to a new Kindle. I was disappointed that it was not as large as my original Kindle and therefore the print is smaller. There are features that were part of old Kindle which I miss with the Paperwhite. Knowing what I know now I would stayed with the old Kindle rather than purchase a new one.
Matthew S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The only issue I have is that the touch screen gets rather laggy when navigating the normal menu and shopping. In that way the device feels outdated but I would trade the speed of typical tablet and the color for the ability to read without any strain on my eyes over time. If you are only using it for reading than this is the way to go.
Rossy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"they raved about the kindle and i got a low price for my 5 year old kindle,
the new one works exactly as it is suposed to but it is essentially the same as the old one and the rebate for the exchange was not up to the standard, I am sorry i got involved, my reading experience has NOT changed"
B&Okie,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is great to have the night view (black background and white text) and being waterproof is great. The touch screen is not as responsive as I would like though. Sometimes it takes a hard push on the screen to make it work. TONS of storage. I wish it had a speaker since I can use Audible now.
Olydawg,5.0 out of 5 stars,Replaced an old kindle that did not have a back light or touch screen with this model. I was surprised on how much smaller it was because it had touch screen instead of keyboard but reading screen was the same size if not bigger. Battery seems to charge quickly and last a long time. I was able to use my old charging cord so didn't ned to pay for a new one. It is very lightweight and waterproof.
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my daughter. It came in today and I’m not impressed. I turned it on to get it set up and it’s slow responding, when you click a button the screen freaks out and kinda pixelates for a second. I’ll give it a shot but I’m really counting on having to return it."
Peter Noll,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the second Kindle Paperwhite I've bought. I still use the first one also but I got this one because it's waterproof and I sometimes use it when in a bath. I like it and use it frequently without any problems. It's nice to take along to places where I will have to wait for appointments and things.
CEF,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was surprisingly easy to set up. I declined to purchase any books however. Instead I use my public library's APP for borrowing e-books. Their APP is easy to use too & my tax dollars are already spent for the library. I have resisted purchasing a device as I SO enjoy holding a book to read. I will still read books but the Kindle is easy to use especially when traveling.
K. Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my seventh kindle and I really like the feature of it being waterproof. I had some issue getting the Bluetooth to work right, then I figured out that I had to turn off Bluetooth and re turn it on each time I wanted to connect. After I figured it out, I have enjoyed the kindle much more."
Jenny,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Battery drains very quickly - no way you will get the 2 weeks as advertised. The biggest issue however is that it sometimes just won’t wake up. You have to keep holding restart button over and over until it finally reboots. I would have sent it back except it took me a full day to download my books to it plus I bought accessories for it. My version 2 Kindle was a 1000 times better than this one. Here I was looking forward to a new and improved model. When it works, it is great but when it doesn’t total frustration."
Sara C,2.0 out of 5 stars,"impossible to turn pages. Impossible to get from back to your book, challenging to see what books you have actually bought . And oh so difficult to get to the dictionary.
Find another Kindle to buy. I'd take my 10 years old Kindle any day if that battery wasn't soooo weak.

BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Is Amazon ""just resting on its laurels""???"
Bubbasuzy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good. I I love being able to switch from reading to listening, which is the reason I upgraded from older Paperwhite version. Not only did I get credit for the return (postage paid), Amazon gave me a 20% credit off the price of new version 10! Win, win. How can you beat that? I could love it more it it had black screen with white type, butI can live without it. Battery lasts weeks for me."
C. DeMatteo,3.0 out of 5 stars,BAttery life great! Super light weight...like a feather! Returning though because i can’t download books to it and I’m so frustrated! Don’t understand the problem. Own kindles and never had this issue. Also didn’t realize it’s B&W - no color. Don’t really need color to read text however i like seeing book covers in color.
Allan M. Striker,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The product is an excellent reader. However, it lacks several necessities such as the ability to change the background from white to black with white lettering which is really great for nighttime reading. I was told that the reader fits into the Kindle cover for the previous generation paperwhite. It doesn't. The new reader is slightly smaller than the old one and the fit is loose."
Reflections of Style,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this in Feb 2019. I have tried to charge it several times and it will not take a charge. I want A replacement
Sheri,5.0 out of 5 stars,My last kindle ran out of space. I bought a new one. It can hold my entire collection and more. It is not a hard transition to make. Finding my books is intuitive. I like that my organizational structure carried over -that is my folders are easily available. Many things on this Kindle are so easy - reading is a pleasure. My only complaint is the battery needs to be charged a bit more often.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I previously has owned a second generation Kindle and this one which was given to me by my staff is a significant improvement. when turning off the book you do it by holding the on off button and then using the touch screen which is more positive than my old one where you were never sure it had gone off. The fact that the book turns on when you open its cover is really nice and that there are numerous ways to turn pages is also great. The ability to import documents and read and work on them is also a nice feature. I have also found the white background much easier to read on no matter what tha ambient lighting situation is.
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Kindle is great except I am extremely disappointed that I paid quite a bit extra not to have recommendations: Yet they are there every time I open my screen or close a book and I have to click out of them to get to my list When I click home I get Amazon's recommendations. So I feel I was cheated somewhat.
S. in WA,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First, the battery life is amazing. It's light, especially compared to my first generation Kindle Fire, slim, and actually fits in my back pocket. (Granted, that depends on the pants, but we won't get into women's pockets, there's not enough room here.)
The only issue that I have is the touch reaction time. Turning a page is easy, just tap the side of the screen. But if you want to go to your home page, there's some definite lag. It's enough to make me notice it, but not enough to make me consider a return or different product. Just something to be aware of. Overall, this is exactly what I wanted."
Tenrec,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well I finally upgraded to the newest paper white kindle, I still was using my second generation kindle which I traded in. BTW Amazon, it was still working fine. So you see I’m not into rushing to new tech. This kindle is great, does what I need it to do which is just read books, outside or inside. Special offers aren’t intrusive and it was a snap setting it up. All my old books were right there. All good. Bought a fintie leather cover, great. Amazon replaced the cord which was hard to fit and I am using my old charger."
Patty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This size is much easier to handle when reading for extended periods and very light weight. The only feature I find a problem is the on-off button. It requires the slightest pressure and I find myself inadvertently turning off this newest Paperwhite, however, it starts up very quickly when that occurs. This is my third Kindle ereader and the best of all."
jeff zwerdling,3.0 out of 5 stars,I found a problem with my new Kindle. When I hold it on the right side to read the font item continues to pop up making the print larger and larger. I also noticed when I held the right side of the kindle with my thumb and forefinger My Kindle turns off and I have to restart it. These two above items only occur when I hold the right side of my Kindle with my thumb and forefinger. The font size popping up is irritating.
Mskitty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wanted kindle for beach and boating. This one is a winner. I’ve heard so many negatives about the paper white. I was hesitant to order but so pleased with this product. The lettering is dark and clear even on the sunniest of days. It is small and thin (fits in small purse)
Check out you tube for complete evaluation."
Mary Tanner,4.0 out of 5 stars,My original Kindle quit working so I was using my Ipad to read. I actually prefer my Ipad because the bigger screen means I don't have to flip the page as often but it doesn't have the light feature to read outside. Being able to take my Kindle outside and sit on my deck and read is very relaxing. If it was bigger it would be perfect.
Eric Mrock,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this product to help me read more and use my phone less before bed. It definitely is a game changer in that sense! The battery life is nuts on it too. This thing takes forever to need to be charged! I was hoping I could at least comfortably read some black and white comics (or any comics) on it as well, but i personally think it’s too annoying to do so. But other than that this thing is perfect! Pair it with an app like Libby, and you’ll almost never have to pay for another book ever again!"
GW,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a previous model kindle paperwhite which I loved and used often. I traded it in for this new paperwhite and oh boy has it been great! The backlight is better and more even. To me, the touchscreen seems more responsive. My experience has been very positive."
sunday,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I live rural and need to have my books on my actual kindle. Due to limited internet access. When My old kindle was full. I started to delete book off. Then I saw on Amazon I could get this 32gb, my last kindle only had 4gb. So far am very please with the new kindle. It is a little bit lighter and a little bit smaller."
David John Carter,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like it very much. I might give it five stars eventually. But one week in is a bit early for a full review. Ask me again in six months time. I bought this because I killed my previous paper white with bathwater. Or at yeast I think that’s it. I could charge it but only get a jumbled display. This one should be able to cope a bit better.
Esther E. Caldwell,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a deal. Traded in my old Kindle for the Kindle paperwhite. It was on sale $99.99 down from $129.99...received an instant $25.00 trade-in allowance. Returned my old Kindle to Amazon with paper work they provided . So easy...
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this product! It's waterproof, it has the ability to invert the colors for the user's preference and it really helps save space for people like me who don't have a lot of space left for physical books. The fact that there is no glare is the best since I'm prone to migraines. The downfall in this product is that for the price, I would hope it would have tablet capabilities, including a better response time when tapping the screen. Maybe I purchased the wrong product but I didn't see any other Paperwhite options. Otherwise, it's great and I still recommend it."
ruby,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the Paperwhite Kindle. Only had it for a few weeks. Easy to use, convenient to carry--tuck it into my purse. Long lasting charge--was advised to keep it in airplane mode to conserve the charge. Found a website-overdrive.com where you can check out Kindle books with your local library card. Also found some free books on Amazon. Good size-variety of font sizes. Easy to load up a new book when you need it. I bought a very nice sturdy and attractive cover for the Kindle. Keeps it protected and turns off the device when it closes. So far really Love the Paperwhite. First experience with an e-reader."
Lark Logan,5.0 out of 5 stars,I accidentally ordered a similar Kindle that did not have the back light. I just received the correct model and could not be happier. I’ve had a Kindle since it first came out as I love having books on the go! This version with adjustable back lighting permits reading in absolute dark. Easy to use and an absolute joy.
KellyBlock,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot say enough great things about the new Kindle Paperwhite! It is everything (and more) that people are saying it is! Lightweight, lighting is fabulous and adjustable, easy on your eyes, especially wonderful with a cover, easy to download books, so so easy to take wherever you go, never forgets where you left off, etc. I haven’t found a single thing I don’t like!"
William E. Ulrich,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got tired of read books piling up so I purchased this. Good deals on books plus with Prime membership you get some good reads. I really like my kindle and it's easy to navigate and doesn't take over my nightstand. Also, very easy to travel with. The one big negative for me is that it is too small. I find it distracting to blow thru a page in a minute or so. Most likely just me but it impedes the flow of the book and retention."
C Peters,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second paper white and third Kindle. Although my kindle is terrific, I actually preferred my prior version as the cover was a bit nicer and the touch screen wasn’t quite as sensitive. I find myself accidentally turning the page quite often. Otherwise, I love the ease of use and ability to store an endless number of books."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the new Paperwhite. It is easy on my eyes. It's so lightweight it's easy on my wrist. Small enough to fit in my purse for when I have to wait for appointments. I was frustrated after a trip with not being able to read my Kindle Fire in the car due to the glare, but this solved the problem. It was hard to hold on to at first, so I bought a pop dot for the phone and it fits perfectly, makes it easy to hold and turn the page with my thumb. What I don't like is it's too way to turn the pages by mistake and unlike the Fire, it's hard to find the page you were on before. No search feature."
J. Cole,5.0 out of 5 stars,Glad for the upgrade. I’m not crazy about the way my titles are displayed on the home screen. Would rather they be listed. Battery life is great.
Saffyre,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so happy when this arrived in the mail! I bought it as part of the Amazon Prime Day sales and traded in my old kindle paperwhite which had a crack in the screen. This meant I got this kindle at a really great price of $89 and then an additional $32.50 taken off the sale price for trading in my old one. I loved my old kindle but am much more happy with this one. It's smooth, sleek and the battery life, screen and built-in light are functioning just as described.
I highly recommend using the trade-in option if you are looking to replace an old kindle that may be slightly damaged."
Patty,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently received a Kindle paperwhite as a gift. I was thrilled and couldn’t wait to start using it. However, I thought I was going to be able to use an app to borrow books from a local library to read on the Kindle. I was disappointed to learn that I could borrow books but would have to pay for them. Am I missing something here? Why would I pay for it when I can read it for free on my mini pad?"
Sheri A.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like how long it lasts and the lighting is good, but it's not as user friendly as the app. I can't maneuver the books and samples as easily. I wish i could separate them but can't

The whispersync was activated then it doesn't sync, then it's somehow not activated. Happened a couple times."
Arden R. Wise,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a really great little unit. The only thing I don't like about it is the light for reading in a dark room, it is so bright my wife can't sleep. It needs to be like my Iphone - day time reading on the Iphone is a white screen and black letters, night time reading is black screen with white letters. This makes it not so blinding for reading in a dark room. Other then this I love it."
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Just for reading. It’s much smaller than my old Paperwite. While this is handy, because I use a larger font (due to vision loss), I need to keep flipping pages too often. Thus I much prefer my kindle fires!!"
Satyr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the Kindle Fire for years. Wasn't my intention, it was a gift. It was a tablet first, e-reader second, and the battery and weight of the thing slowly tapered my reading off. When it finally died, I picked this up and haven't been able to stop reading since. It's incredibly lightweight, easy to navigate through, and the battery lasts over a week of reading every single day. I highly recommend it."
L. Cooke,4.0 out of 5 stars,This Kindle overall is an improvement on my previous one. But the default page turns setting would balk every 10 pages and then turn two pages requiring a flip back. I almost returned it but by changing the page setting to “refresh on every page it doesn’t do that anymore. This is really something that should not be in the 10th generation of the device.
DJ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this item because this item loaded only the titles of the books and not the book covers. It would not update. No matter how many times I tried, it would not download the covers. I started to do each one at a time and it still would not work. It was also very time- consuming. I bought this because my other Kindle quit. I still need a kindle so I'm going to try the new Kindle. If this one doesn't work, I don't know what I'll do. I'm sorry I had to return it."
Cerrone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm enjoying it so far. The battery life isn't as good as my other kindle, but that one wasn't touchscreen or back lit either. It needs a case though. It's a bit uncomfortable to hold for long periods. I'm hoping a case will help. I got mine during the prime day sale for $85, so I recommend that you wait for a sale."
Molly M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered a Paperwhite about 15 years ago and have always loved it. It still works great but I thought it was time to upgrade so I ordered a new waterproof one. I am going to pass my old one on to my sister because it has lots of life left in it. I really love my new one. I strongly recommend this kindle if you are considering buying one. I thought the price was also very reasonable for the quality of the item.
Spider1,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I found that the Kindle Paper white is a handy way to carry your reading material. The size is handy compact and not bulky. Easily stored in a briefcase, backpack, or gym bag. The leather protective case is a great item to add to protect the Kindle. The font is adjustable to size and this makes it easy to read in any environment."
Jeannie W,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th Kindle. Obviously I love Kindle, and my last Kindle lasted 7 years before having issues. However, I have some issues with this new Paperwhite. First of all, because it is waterproof there is no ""lip"" around it; therefore it is easy as i am holding it to move my thumb and accidentally turn to the next page. Secondly, in their advertising of this Kindle Amazon does not explain what ""with special offers"" means. What it does mean is that every time I open my Kindle, I get advertising for Amazon books. Before I can start reading, I must ""swipe"" to start reading. I went on-line to find out how I could get rid of this annoying feature and found out that getting rid of Amazon's advertising every time I opened my Kindle would cost me an extra $20. Beware."
Renee L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was afraid I wouldn't like it, wouldn't be big enough, or hard to upload library books. I LOVE it! Perfect size, easy to use, and can upload my library books with ease! It may seem difficult at first, but it's not at all. Definitely a huge winner and awesome gift, I'll never run out of books!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Sony E Reader, of coarse no longer supported, but the paperwhite screen is what sold me on it at the time. I feel it is more comfortable to view over longer periods than a regular tablet style screen. This Kindle has that and alot more, I like that it can connect to the internet and upload books from anywhere the Sony you had to load them on the computer and transfer them. Which was a problem as I read on my lunch at work, when I would finish a book I found my self buying a paperback which defeated the whole purpose of the e-reader in my eyes. This kindle will let me collect books and not have to worry about storing them. I think it will be great."
Harrisonville Hamster,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The screen is very clear and easy to read. I did have some trouble bringing up a new book that I ordered, but found all information that I needed in support. The lite weight and thin build give it a really nice feel. I am very happy."
Heidi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because my other Kindle (Oasis) was just a tad big and uncomfortable to hold for long periods- like the 15 hour flights I was doing. This new Kindle is just enough smaller and lighter that I can use it for those flights without issue. When at home, I can read everywhere I go. It is super convenient. I love my new Kindle"
Greg,5.0 out of 5 stars,Many new features and improvements compared to my original Kindle reader. Touch screen with no keyboard or forward/ back buttons make it easier to operate and significantly smaller with the same screen size. Backlighting for low light is a plus as is the waterproof case. Battery life is somewhat reduced from the original due to the backlighting but still lasts for days on a charge. Great reader!
Jessica Oborn,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the Kindle Voyage before the new paperwhite. I enjoy the new paperwhite, I like the size of this new one. I miss the page turning buttons and the feature that adjusted the brightness of the screen with every page turn. The new paperwhite is advertised as ""water proof"" but when I got it, there was a note in the box stating that it wasn't water proof, you shouldn't read with it in the pool (as is advertised) and that it is merely water resistant. This wasn't a huge deal for me as I don't plan to submerge the kindle. I do like that it is at least water resistant, giving me the knowledge that if liquid accidentally gets spilled, it will be okay. Overall, I like the new paperwhite but I do miss the voyage and some of its features."
C. Clines,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What's not to like? Easy to hold and read. Don't need a light. Can immediately look up a word definition without losing place in the book you're reading. At the bottom of screen, page number and percentage of book read is displayed. Plus, of course, you can store a huge library on the Kindle."
James,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th Kindle, so obviously I like them. I use it in the USA and on trips all over places we travel. 7 ounces and unlimited books, so it's easy to pack. A person can read it virtually anywhere under almost any lighting conditions and download books in any country where I have been."
Donna Vinton,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it! It’s small and light. Great backlighting. Easy on eyes. Bought cover that takes care of the off and on. Had 100’s of books on my old IPad and it was easy to transfer them over.
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Still have problems getting it to accept my bluetooth for audio. Sometimes it works ,sometimes it doesn't. Screen is super touchy. But all in all I like it very much."
Karen McMillan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle's battery wore out. I contacted Amazon and they asked me to return my old Kindle and they would replace it. They were going to send a refurbished Kindle, but none were available, so they sent me a new one. It arrived today, I registered it, all my books from my old Kindle transferred immediately. An update was done with no issues! Everything works great on this newer Kindle. The only issue is that my old magnetic cover doesn't put this new Kindle to sleep when I close it, I have to do it by pushing the button. I just have to order a new cover.
I am so happy with the response I got from Mary at Amazon. She was so great to work with and I am now happily reading from my new Kindle."
Iowa Gal,5.0 out of 5 stars,I read all the time. Have always enjoyed having a book in my hands. Finally succumbed to the Kindle because of convenience and unending supply of books. Anxious to get it synced to the local library. I have 3 grandsons that play a lot of basketball. It is easy to take Kindle and read between games.
Mundiz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was thinking this one would be better than previous generation but it seems to be a downgrade. Foremost it starts feeling heavy after sometime of reading and can be realized. The weight is the thing I don't like in ereader, it must be like a feather that one is immersed in reading than other aspects. The audio mode would drain the battery quicker. The text is not as sharp as I had expected."
Emily,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my old kindle for this and so far I am loving it! The interface is very user-friendly and my favorite part is that I can email myself PDFs for work and download them to my kindle. However, please make sure that all your reading materials are manually downloaded and have a circled checkmark on the cover. I made that mistake and ended up have nothing to read while away from my house."
Shannon J. Kilgore,1.0 out of 5 stars,These things break within one year. Same problem time and again. Battery wont take charge or last and charging plug-in receiver wont connect reliably with the provided charging apparatus. Then if you are lucky enough to have warranty time left the replacement has only the remaining original warranty and not a full 12 months as on a new product. Then that one breaks within 12 months and they wont replace it. Awful hardware quality. Poor customer service.
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I left my older Paperwhite on a plane so this was a replacement. Why in the world anyone would put the power button on the bottom of the device is beyond me - most people rest the device when they aren't holding it up so this is the last place it should be. The upper right power button was better. The curved sides i don't feel are better - maybe for a palm size device for ergo but someone copied Apple didn't think about how it's held as a larger size device. Lastly, this one feels heavier. I will keep it but think the older version was better."
Dr. Geoff,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best Kindle yet, hands down. Perfect size to read, waterproof for tub or beach use, excellent cover, incredible battery life, easy to use, and thank the Maker it works with audio books. So thin and light you can take anywhere and read in any light. I love it, it's perfect for me."
GJJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate the slow-to-react keyboard. I love how clear the screen is. I’m not crazy about the user interface. Battery life is decent, not terrific as I was led to believe. The backlight is impressive."
Gary C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,I love to read with the kindle paper white. However it does not work. The pages lockup and will not turn to the next page. Sometimes I can go back a couple pages and then go forward. This the same problem I had with the first kindle paper white I bought and this is a replacement. It seems to be an ongoing problem. I will return this and go back my original kindle. I am very disappointed!!
AnnaLouise,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the 8th or 9th Kindle I have purchased because I have been buying them for my family-the Paperwhite is amazing because it is easy to see in daylight and is also back lit so you can read in bed without having a light on and keeping someone else awake. It is very light weight and slips right into my purse so I can take it anywhere. It holds hundreds of books so I never have to weigh my luggage down when I go on vacation.
Ashley P,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this thing. Light can be really bright or just light enough to read in a dimly lit room. The waterproofing is a bonus but I haven’t put that to the test. Touch screen could be a little more responsive. Plenty of storage space the only thing I’m not in love with is how the home screen doesn’t immediately show your library you have to click into it. But that’s only a minor annoyance. Overall glad I got it.
Richard,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the older kindle before that had buttons on the bottom and did not light up. It lasted for years and the battery lasted a very long time. I broke the screen and had to replace it. My new Paperwhite battery only lasted a few days before it needs to be recharged, even when not in use. Now it won't even take a charge. The screen shows an empty battery with an explanation mark inside the battery. If this Kindle worked I would of rated it differently, because I liked the size and the way it looks when you read it."
A. Covington,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the paper white version before this one and cracked the screen in a small spot. I just received this one about a month ago. I love it as much as the last one. I really love the waterproof element to this one as well. I usually don’t read reviews but I almost didn’t put this on my wishlist because of some of the reviews. I’m glad I took a chance anyway. Mine does not have any pinholes or blurry spots. The lighting is just as good, and thanks to my cover that shuts it off when I close it, I haven’t noticed any battery issues either."
Rebecca Cross,1.0 out of 5 stars,"While it was working the device was great. The built in light is great for reading in bed. But the device broke after only a few months and, although apparently still under ""warranty,"" I spent nearly an hour on the phone with Amazon customer service before they would agree to send me a refurbished Kindle as a replacement (you would think if it broke, they would apologize and send a new one)."
Kelly,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve been using my kindle for about 2 weeks. It’s reminiscent of my old nook simple touch that I used several years ago. I like that I can easily navigate between audible and the kindle if I happen to be using both for a longer book. It only took me a couple of days to get used to navigating the kindle and I am not a very tech savvy person. I do wish there weren’t so many ads when you are trying to open books from your reading list so the actual list could be bigger. I also like that there is a link to goodreads so when you finish and rate a book it automatically updates your goodreads account.
Mark D. Hawthorne,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read my Kindle on a daily basis many times throughout the day. I appreciate 300 dots resolution, I like the fact the battery lasts longer. I like having my entire collection of books stored on my device with plenty of room to add more. Finally, I like not having to worry about it if a sudden shower pops up while I am outside reading since I know the water will not harm it."
MeL,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE my Paperwhite!! The only issue I have is that sometimes when reading, I’ll tap to go to the next page and it jumps several pages, then when I tap to go back to where I was, it gets stuck in loop of like the same 3 pages. Doesn’t happen too often, but love it otherwise. I can actually read my eBooks outside again!"
Patrick Castro,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I replaced my older gen paperwhite with this product. And while the battery life is significantly improved and it still reads very well, it has had technical issues. The screen will glitch to where you can’t read any words and the system requires a hard reboot to recover. After this reboot, the system would auto reboot every ten minutes or so while trying to read. When technical support was contacted. They were of no help and just indicated I keep preforming reboots on my automatically rebooting product. Hopefully there will be a software upgrade/patch fix soon."
RJE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle had quit working, so I needed a new one. This one is smaller, but with the same or slightly larger screen size. I love reading with a Kindle, and this one is as easy as the last one. I'm still getting used to not having a keyboard. And my only disappointment is that the library I had on my previous Kindle did not download automatically."
Diane M. Davidson,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am so happy with this newest generation it is waterproof. Took it to Mexico and used it at beach and on ship. Ordering a case to protect it even more. No issue with the new location of off/on button. I haven’t set up audiobook portion but I have high expectations. I took advantage of trade in and got $50 gift card for more books! Win for me!
Ashley Lough,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Kindle Ereaders and have had several. I am a big reader and therefore mine only last about 3 years. After that point, they give up the ghost.

Anyway, I purchased this new edition about a month ago. I love the built in light and touch screen. The battery life is not good. Last night, I timed it. It went from 100% to 51% in four hours in Airplane Mode. Two of those hours, I wasn't even reading just had it unplugged (i.e., not charging). The previous edition's battery life is much better. I will be plugging this one in each night."
Donald W. Morgan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Over all it's an excellent unit just like the older kindle it replaced. The only negative, and a very small annoyance at that, is every now and then it jumps multiple pages when advancing. Then I have to go back to where I need to be, small, but annoying. All in all, good purchase and would recommend."
Rhonda Ashburn,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 2nd Kindle. For some reason my 1st one “died”.
All of a sudden it wouldn’t charge or anything, very frustrating.
I returned that one, & now have this one.
I hope this holds up as I can honestly say I like reading on the kindle.

My 2nd one has just died!!! Why is this happening??? How can I finish my current book??
I’m beyond frustrated.

Now I see I cannot return this 2nd non-working Kindle!!! I will not waste my money again!!!!!!!"
Kathleen B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a BOOK person, but I have so many that I have to stop buying. Our library is okay, but living in a small town, I usually have to wait for it to transfer to our library. I was getting tired of packing heavy books or even carrying them on a plane ride also. This is great for my purse..Would recommend"
Mykalia Weaver,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered the version without the adds, but still have ads when I turn it on. Not a big deal but it seems like a waste of $20 to me. Other than that, I love the device. The battery life is amazing and there’s no glare when I read. I haven’t tested out the waterproof yet, but I bought this to read while at the pool, so if it is waterproof then that’s perfect for my uses. The touch screen isn’t remotely as smooth as a smart phone but it does pretty good."
Redflexyflyer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’’m not sure what happened here. I thought I was replacing my paperwite I’d lost. This is smaller (but ok). It seems to require an internet connection to work for purchase/downloads. It seems my old one worked anywher. This ones ok for home use, but I found my old one and will use it for travel."
Ricardo,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I made the mistake of buying this device as an upgrade from the previous generation. It was a complete waste of money. I didn't really need waterproofing or the extra storage, honestly. When turning the older kindle and the newer Kindle side by side-by-side, the older one always wins by several seconds. On top of that, the battery drains so quickly, it's not funny.

I don't want to do it, but I think I'll have to return this because it makes absolutely no sense at all to keep it."
The Ship,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This version of the Kindle Paperwhite is perfect. It's the right size: about 1/2 an iPad. It's the right shape: it fits in my hand. It's the right technology: e-ink, back-lit, water resistant, with audio (bluetooth). When I unplug and leave all the other screens behind, I'll be slipping this into my jacket pocket to catch up on all the reads I never get to read."
J. Corder,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle paperwhite appears to be working well but unfortunately, cannot use it for another week as the included USB charging cable is defective. I cannot re-charge the Kindle. Amazon will replace the cable but it takes up to a week for delivery. So, I cannot use this new e-reader due to Amazon's faulty cable."
Milkyway413,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn’t like much about it at all.
1. It’s tiny
2. Difficult to use
3. I could not figure out how to exit the book and return to the main screen
4. Awful screen quality
5. Extremely difficult to read
6. No zoom

Long story short, I attempted to understand how to use it once. And could never figure out how to exit the book or logout. The charge4 was shipped separately and it didn’t even fit. It was returned promptly and was still logged in."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the new paperwhite kindle - especially the lit screen. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the ads on the screensaver. I really don't want ads on my screensaver and preferred the screensaver on my old kindle with famous authors.
K.Kronenberg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Although I am not willing to test the waterproof factor, it is just as I expected.
Easier touch screen and swiping, great battery life, lightweight, and the backlighting is easy to adjust.

Getting a case for the right model was a bit tricky, but I was able to return the ones that did not work."
Sean G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always enjoyed the time I have spent reading, but wouldn't call myself ""a reader"". I've always had the problem of getting distracted looking at a page in a printed book. It was ""too busy"" but this lets me adjust the font and spacing so I am reading a lot more. I had the fire HD8, which is good but I couldn't take it and read outside and I can with this. Also the lighter feel in your hands just makes it a joy."
jbfarm2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to read on the screen even in bright sunlight. The water-proof feature makes me confident using it around the pool. One criticism is the power button on the bottom and depending how you hold it will occasionally blink off.
Patricia R. Schuetz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is a thing of beauty, but it’s the second one i ordered in a week. The first began to ignore touch commands after about four days, and to randomly change fonts and turn pages. Tech support was apologetic, it somehow could not be replaced, they refunded my money and I ordered a new one with 1-day delivery on my husband’s Prime account. So, no harm, no foul, but kind of a nuisance since I have to box and return the old one. Amazon is going to have to beef up its quality control."
hpnotiqblu,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great battery life. It's a nice handheld size and weighs next to nothing. There is zero glare reading out in the sun. I haven't submerged it yet but i have gotten it wet and so far it's still in working order. All and all I love this purchase. This has made me more confident in purchasing the higher end model, the oasis."
Lynn Schmitt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the new Paperwhite and enjoy it very much. It is lighter, and smaller than my original Kindle that I have had for years. I love the backlight too. The pages turn with a swipe and the book covers show up in your library which is nice. I like that you can click on the book and it brings up a synopsis. I look forward to a lot of great reads with my new Kindle."
Mary Y Robinson,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am enjoying having a small hand-held reader that is better for my eyes! I found a cute case with hand holder on it also and they work great together! I did purchase cord separately. So far I am down-loading library books that I borrow so I don't accumulate so many books. 68 yr old senior
Audrey Johnson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My new Kindle will go forward 2-3 pages and then at other times go backward. Sometimes it takes many times to go forward. I am waiting for a replacement which is due on April 8, 2020."
tryky,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love to read and I travel a lot. This is perfect! Even though I prefer a ""real"" book, the Kindle Paperwhite is the perfect compromise. Even better if I finish a book while I'm traveling I can just download another book easily, no need to find a bookstore or wait until I get home to read another book. I love the audible feature because I can listen to a book as I go to sleep."
Lucie,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the Kindle Paperwhite. But: Amazon advertise that the battery lasts weeks and the first weeks I used it, I had to recharge it after about 15-16 hours or reading. So, I sent it back and got a new one day before yesterday. I charged it completely and yesterday, I read for 5 hours and the bettery is at 71% so it looks to me that the battery again won't last nearly as long as they advertise. And I do not keep it connected to Wifi while I read. And I don't have the ads on it either. So........what is the problem with the batteries ?? My 7-8 years old one lasted longer than this new one!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love my Kindle Paperwhite! I have an astigmatism and reading can be difficult, but my eyes seem to focus easily on the Kindle Paperwhite.
It is lightweight, easy and comfortable to hold and fits just about anywhere to take with me.
The touchscreen isnotas sensitive as a phone or tablet, but that actually may be best for this use.
Very pleased."
PaulaS,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Paperwhite for my elderly, visually-impaired mother to take on a long trip. When it arrived, I was surprised at how small it is. It is hardly larger than a paperback book. That may be its intention but when I enlarged the font so she could read it, it was so difficult to tell how the pages ran. I am returning it and getting her a Fire 8, just like mine."
Ann Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and a comfort to know it is waterproof
SD,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was in the group of people who never thought they’d transition from paper books to e-readers. This thing is a dream come true.

I bought the larger 32gb and love that I can have essentially an unlimited amount of books available at any time. For the days that I would bring one book with me and suddenly have cravings for another, this works perfectly with its ability to jump between several in seconds. Small, lightweight, fits into my bag no problem. I no longer have to worry about creasing or tearing book pages while books bounce around in my backpack.

This along with AirPods are my two favorite tech purchases of the year."
RedPooka,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got it. I really liked it. Nice reading, right size. Then it ran out of juice, so I recharged it.

Now it doesn't work. I get a big exclamation point in the middle of a battery icon on the screen. Resetting doesn't work. The problem is mentioned on Kindle forums, but the only fix they offer is a reset. Resetting it doesn't work.

So I just paid $129 for an e-reader that let me read part of one book."
michael burch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"so far doing good havent tried out waterproof feature yet and its still half charged a month later so seems good, the trade in deal of getting 25 for old one worked but it didnt do the 25 percent off, but when i called amazon they did give me a credit of equal amount so it worked out great"
Bear Coggins,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love how lite it is wish it was bigger thow look at pic
The customization on it sucks needs a better screen too I paid way to much for this its supposed to be water proof as well won't be testing that
Butt to read books outside fantastic works perfectly so thank you for that amazon"
Kathleen T. Wheeler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a ""lover of actual books"" - so I have been hesitant to buy a Kindle for fear that I wouldn't be able to get past the idea of having an actual book. I am now a Kindle owner and couldn't be happier with my purchase. It is so convenient to pack up to go anywhere - and I don't read small books - so when traveling this comes in very handy. I travel quite a bit for work, and am always drawn in by airport book sellers. Now, I can stop the impulse buying and start downloading. There will be room for any book that catches my eye on the Kindle, unlike the lack of room available in my backpack as I wander through the airports!"
Anthony Marshall,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A whole new world has opened up for me. For years I have used the original type of Kindle, but to read you had to have a light on. Today I can read my Kindle in any light. The screen is very responsive and the Battery seems to last much longer than my past Kindles. Love my new Kindle."
Nancy Dunford,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like that it is lighter than by previous Kindle. The fact that it is waterproof isn’t as important to me. I am not crazy about it shadowing all of the books I have purchased. Since I have over 500, it is not easy remembering which ones I have already read. I will have to keep my previous Kindle for this purpose since I could remove each book I read from the Home screen. I liked that feature."
Sjon Woodlyn,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the Kindle, perfect for reading in every condition I’ve experienced so far, no complaints. The one issue that is my concern is with the “special offers”. Admittedly I didn’t know to what this referenced, so I blame myself. It refers to the offers that show up on the screen when the Kindle is sleeping, offers also available in the special offers section in the Kindle. I do find them interesting and have used once or twice, but not what I was expecting. I really like this, only wish I could rent school books on it!"
dragonfly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this new Kindle. Lost my old one, and since I am a daily reader, i replaced it right away. My Kindle is like and Amex card. I don't leave home without it. If I am stuck somewhere for more than 5 minutes, out comes my Kindle, and I do not mind the wait. I like the tap page turn. And all the other features about it. Makes my life easier and complete"
Phelan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this for an upcoming overseas trip for 6 weeks. We have an older Kindle that did not have the backlighting and I LOVE this feature. I frequently wake up and read at night and don't need to turn on a light now--yay! I don't know how long the battery life is yet. Liked getting a bright cover and the idea of the device being water resistant.
Betty L. Davidson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very great device. Very lightweight to hold, excellent size screen, and readable both indoors and outdoors. Also last for hours on one charge. Find it best to dim the light all the way during daylight outdoors and then only use when it is dark. Very happy with this purchase. Recommend to anyone who loves to read for long periods."
Rob Placek,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle is great for rafting and is easy in the eyes in light or dark with the adjustable brightness of the screen. The size is perfect and battery life is phenomenal.
The screen has a little bit of lag time to it and sometimes it seems a little more difficult to search for titles on the tablet than on the site or mobile app."
MachinegunDAV,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgrading from a Nook Glow Light, it has many upgrades!!! I love my new Kindle... for sure!
No memory card??? OMG really... and that annoying screen refresh thing...its 2018 why can't that be a thing of the past? But other than that it's perfect!"
Nanny,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love that you don’t need a reading light to read at night. The size is nice - easy to hold. I replaced my first generation Kindle with this one so it’s been a learning curve since it’s touch & doesn’t have buttons or a keyboard.
Dan Albertson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle. The size, battery life and readable in direct sunlight screen are awesome. Yet even though im an experienced Android smartphone and apple computer user I find some aspects of the user interface slow, less responsive and at times confusing. But I still prefer it to paper books."
DC_LA.dy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this kindle. I had the Kindle Fire previously and my children kept grabbing it to play games and it was never charged when I was ready to sit down to enjoy a book. This is great for out in the sun laying by the pool as well as at night laying in the bed with no lights on. It is light weight making it comfortable to hold and stays charged for a very long time. I prefer reading ebooks over regular books, reading on my phone or kindle fire was sending my kids the wrong message. Now they know I am clearly reading a book verse checking email, searching web, etc."
carol,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so disappointed. My 7th generation works better than this new kindle. I'm so upset because it was just a promotion to get you to change. The light is darker, the touch screen blinks on and off and sometimes takes an extra 5-10 seconds to come on once you open the case. I want my money back!!!!!!"
B. Stokes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The perfect reading tool! I like that it is lightweight, has good graphics and fonts for easy reading, and can be read day or night. Also, you can highlight words and have automatic dictionary look up and Wikipedia search for added information. You can also connect to audio through Bluetooth to listen to audible books. Way cool!"
Thompson H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I traded in my older paperwhite (2017 model) for this one because the Prime Day price was right and I liked that it is waterproof. But this new paperwhite is SO responsive. Page turns are lightning fast. I didn't realize how slow my old paperwhite was until now. Definitely recommend this to anyone. Best eReader ever.
Patrick Murphy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Only problem I have seen is the power on the bottom is not recessed which makes it easy to accidentally turn off, other wise, as expected. The selling point was actually the fact that I could pay for it in installments. My old Paperwhite screen had some annoying scratches but, since I only used it for reading at the pool I had a hard time justifying the cost to replace it. But, with the payment plan, it was a no brained."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,I wish it came complete with charger and a longer cord. Having to buy the charger separately is insulting
plush,3.0 out of 5 stars,So far not much to like as I don't know how to set it up without an instruction book and more than half the numbers or letters I type fail to enter correctly My modem password is very long and consist of numbers and letters. I'm feeling I should not have purchased it as I'm not an advanced teck geek.
CantonShelly,4.0 out of 5 stars,The paperwhite backlight doesn't seem as brite as I would like it. The cover I bought with it makes it difficult to hold and read with one hand. Havent used it much so far as the weather in Florida these past weeks has not been conducive to sitting and reading outside. I have another Kindle reader for inside use.
James A Hilston,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A lot of the Fire's features were superfluous because I already use a smartphone. I only needed it for reading (my previous Paperwhite was inadvertently sat upon--by me--and died an untimely death). My lovely wife caught me reminiscing and missing my Paperwhite--the ability to read in the sun, the long battery life, simplicity of use--and surprised me by ordering one for me for Father's Day. I'm very happy to be back among Paperwhite users. I gave the touch-screen a slightly lower rating because it's a bit fiddly or knacky when it comes to highlighting passages, although I trust that I grow accustomed to it and develop a ""touch"" over time."
J Rose,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm very pleased. An issue I've had with backlit e-readers is contrast control and this addresses that issue. I'm able to make the text as bold as necessary so that its not washed out or hazy looking when the screen is brightly lit. The size is comfortable for reading and there are many reading options. I like having Goodreads connected on the device and adding my books automatically if I wish.
Swparker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second kindle paperwhite. My old one was lagging. I had had it for several years. I decided this year I would get an update. The touch screen reacts much faster and the words seem clearer. The battery life seems about equal, but I haven't exactly timed it. I would buy again."
Carlos G. Monzon-Guzman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You can carry an entire library on this device.

Out of the 32GB, about 5GB are used by the system. So, that only about 27GB can be used for storage.

My 38 Kindle books occupy 373MB, almost nothing.

I also own a Kindle DX, and a Kindle Keyboard, both dinosaurs by today’s standard. This new Kindle Paperweight 10th Gen completely blows them out of the water."
Dobers,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle and I'm delighted with it so far after a month of use. It's light and easy to read. As a reading device, it is perfect. The only minor gripe I have is that the touch screen is a bit tricky to use, especially when highlighting words, but for just simply reading a book, it works like a charm."
Albertha Heffner,3.0 out of 5 stars,"What I dislike most is that the newest Kindles do not have the ability to use Text-to-Speech. Which is available in almost every book I buy for my Kindle. But then you make the newer Kindles and they do not have the ability to utilize it. I have a long commute and most of my ""reading"" is done in my car. So unless I spend more money, I cannot hear it with my new Kindle. Outside of that, which is major, I like the size, battery life and touch screen."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great kindle especially for kindle unlimited readers. I like being able to filter just kindle unlimited books and able to return easily. I do recommend that you use a case with it the back is slippery to touch. I really enjoy the size easy to slip in my vest pocket and can read on the go.
claybird,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This PaperWhite is a litte thinner than previous models, but physically, that’s the only difference. The upgrades are on the insides. My previous PW seem to be slowing down, perhaps, with over 300 books installed. With the trade-in offer, I upgraded. Wife is happy, got new bright floral cover for her. She carries her PW everywhere. I still have my Voyage."
Helen Dubo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"this arrived on Thursday. today is Sunday, still cannot connect to wifi, I believe it will be going back tomorrow. Updated: 4/16/19 The second Amazon person I spoke with got me up and running yesterday. As I am used to the Kindle Fire there are a couple of small things that I am not crazy about but they aren't major. I really like that there is no glare, even outside! in the sun!"
TerriK,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my one item I wanted for Christmas but my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. The interface is clumsy, menu is useless, processing so slow you can’t highlight and once you do highlight you cannot find your highlights, and it’s very overpriced. Come on Amazon, you can do much better than this. Reading from my phone and iPhone is so much better and didn’t cost me anything. Returned."
Sandy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really a cut above my previous Paper white Kindle does however need to improve upon their charging port they don’t hold up very long
JUDY,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my all new kindle paperwhite. Very light weight and is very easy to handle with one hand without fatigue to hand or fingers.
Love I can listen for hours while I’m driving or cleaning house without using the battery up too fast like my phone."
Jeoffrey Lim,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for reading does everything it’s suppose To do. Definitely better than apple for reading. But the touch screen is not as good as apples. My daughter loves it. The 3 mos free
Kindle is not for every book it’s just the kindle
Unlimited. Don’t make the same mistake I did."
Brian A,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very disappointed in the product. The touch screen is intermittent and quirky. The interface is not intuitive and the response is slow. I happily used a Kindle 2 (old brick style) for years, but thought is was time to upgrade. I was mistaken."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon offered a paperwhite trade-in program for the new waterproof paperwhite. I returned my Voyage paperwhite as instructed and it was returned as cracked screen. When received there was nothing wrong with the unit. It was just as I had sent it. I am returning this unit because actually it was slower than my Voyage and since the Voyage is fine, I didn't need a second paperwhite."
Eyþór,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This does not replace the paperbacks but it's very handy to have. I think the kindle is a much better option when reading before bed. You can adjust the screen backlight so that it does not keep you awake long after you finish reading, it's also very light and comfortable to hold in hand. Also, you can't beat it if you are backpacking or traveling light. It's pretty great to have loads of books available to you in a tiny and lightweight package."
Cindy Mulkey,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has a program whereby you can trade in your older Kindle to buy a new one; do not do it. Nothing is worth the aggravation of dealing with representatives who are cannot speak English and have no desire to help. After an hour and being transferred three times to three incompetent people, I just gave up and returned everything including the new Kindle. Now, Amazon is taking its sweet time in refunding the $ 130 I am owed back to my credit card. If you want a new Kindle, just buy it outright because nothing is worth dealing with their trade in division."
Alanood,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love kindle paper white, it makes it easy to read anywhere. But the battery life isn’t very good. I find myself plugging it every three days. The built in light could be better. Sometimes I need more light or warm light. Also the touch screen sometimes is very difficult to navigate."
Austinite,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My gen 4 lasted 6 years. I was very happy with it, now I have a new paperwhite. Water proof !! and I can read in the dark !
The backlight is great and battery is still lasting weeks. More space for books. What is not to like?"
Sue,5.0 out of 5 stars,Had a Kindle Touch for many years and loved it. Still works great but really wanted the back lit feature for reading in dim light. Love the Paper White. Also bought the Amazon cover with it so it automatically goes to sleep and wakes up when the cover is open or closed. Very slim design. Great products.
Carlene,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m so disappointed. I’ll be returning this item today. The description of this Kindle on Amazon was vague, and now I suspect that I know why. You cannot download apps to the item, and the only books you can read must be purchased from Amazon. I have used Overdrive in the past to borrow from the library and expected to be able to continue.

I received this Kindle yesterday, and last night it began “freezing”. I even had trouble turning in on and off to reboot.

No thank you. I’ll find another way to read!"
Robert Hall,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the ONLY way to read electronically! Love this product safe for the eyes and as an older person - now I don't have to worry about the size of print in books!
david Siebold,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to able to read comfortably without holding a big book all the time - and this works for me.
Eileen W. Rowe,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Used for reading and found it very frustrating. Pages changed for no reason. Your Kindle experts, after very long conversations, could not help. Returned two before I kept one. Have used a Kindle for many, many years. Always loved them until now. Don't find any improvements worth the frustration. Your Kindle guide is just as annoying. I didn't expect to read a book about the Kindle before being able to use it. The old ones were simple, did all that was needed, and were wonderful. Stop improving and go back to what works easily!"
Carol1107,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my husband. He was using one of the very first Kindles that had a light attache. That kindle finally died. I was apprehensive that he would not like this one because it was smaller & a different light. Much to my pleasure, he really likes this new paper white kindle."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Only complaint is the cover is sold separately and they're not cheap! Otherwise, totally pleased with this product. The waterproof feature was key for me, now I can take it all the places I couldn't with the previous products. Also great to have a backlight for nighttime plane rides, and late nights when my SO is asleep. I am still figuring out the Goodreads feature, though appreciate the opportunity to find book recommendations based on novels I've read and rated. Battery life is awesome, goes several days without needing a charge! Gave the touch screen 4/5 stars only because it is slightly delayed and sometimes the screen flashes when you're changing modules which is really no big deal just odd."
will d,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The software interface isn’t good. I ordered a kindle unlimited and when I wanted to read it it registered as already being read and I had to remove it from my library. Then when I clicked on a new book in my library, another book would open. The screen is to sensitive and keeps jumping around."
CaryNC-AmazonShopper,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the visibility in all lighting including direct sunlight. Love the battery life. Hate the power button on the bottom which is too easily triggered accidentally. A significant mistake in the product’s design. If anyone knows any benefit whatsoever for this power button location please respond.
Linda Lewis Elbert,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just for reading, no distractions, great battery life, light weight, can use it with just one hand, you can read all types of light - bright sun or dark"
Maureen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This kindle was a Xmas gift as my other one was old and did not have a light. The fact that it’s newer and has a light is worth it alone. I do wish, however, that the touch screen was a little less touchy. However with that said, it does seem to be better also with this new one. The battery is fine no real complaints. I don’t read continuously so it seems to wear down faster."
robert close,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to my two year old model,:
Battery life disappointing, lasting half as long between charges, even with screen light turned way down. New one also takes longer to “wake up”. Old model was almost instantaneous where the new one can take a minute or so. Not a big deal but defiantly annoying. The battery is my big concern."
Josh Hamm,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great features for highlighting and bookmarking along with the tools to easily access them make studying easier as a college student. I can easily look up quotes I found important and retrieve them to add to essays or general writings I am doing.

I would highly recommend going to your local library if you don’t have a library card already. Most libraries have eBook lending capabilities that have greater quantity and quality of books for free.

The only reason I’m giving 4/5 is because of Kindle Unlimited. Which is well...rather limited. Unless you’re wanting to read top sellers be prepared to sift through a lot of smaller shorter novels by amateur writers. If that is your niche though have at it but for $9.99/month you’re better off seeing what your local library offers first."
Clarence Gardner,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've loved my paperwhite for several years. Two or three months ago, I lost it, and I've been reading on my phone since then. Recently I bought a newly published book, and I couldn't read it on my phone because the Android app doesn't let you change the font; you can only zoom in on the page, which of course is useless. The font was tiny.

So I said, well, I love paperwhite, so I'll get a new one. Arrived today, and I see what's in the attached picture :("
Rosah,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Kindle paperwhite. I have been hooked on Kindle since my 1st one. This one having a light is such a plus for me. But the most amazing thing about it is the awesome battery life. I read a lot! I used to have to charge my Kindle daily. This one is about every 3 days or so. :)
Maria,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's a mess. I had to download about 800 items by hand. After I had downloaded them some of them duplicated while some of them disappeared. I could not do anything because it was so slow. And screens would appear that had nothing to do with the book I was reading. my first Kindle hd no such issues.
TK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great interface! A little slow to respond if you're expecting it to react like your phone/tablet when searching/scrolling web pages or the store but a fantastic, book-exclusive interface! Much easier on my eyes and easier to wind down while reading this because of how the backlight acts. Great product!! My boyfriend got this as a gift for me and I'm so glad he did!"
Jen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Paperwhite was a gift, and I love it. I no longer need to keep on a lamp when reading at night while my husband is sleeping. It also allows me to read in a quiet corner without having to ensure I have good light. I still love reading real books, but I have really gotten used to reading on this. Plus - no bookmarks needed!"
Eileen SD,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally bought a Kindle. After years of not breaking away from holding a real book...I gave in and bought it! Super happy with the Kindle. The touch screen isn't as responsive as a phone, but I suppose that's to be expected. Perfect size, it even fits in my uniform at work so I can read on my break. Not totally sure how all of the features work yet but that's fine, just happy to read with it!"
T. Haithcock,2.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this for my daughter but most of the books she wanted to download from Kindle on to this device said this device isn't compatible. That makes absolutely no sense to me. Its a Kindle app with books that can't be downloaded to an Kindle device? No thanks! We will just stick to the iPad since we were able to download it the iPad.
K. Fletcher,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There are several improvements in this iteration of the Kindle Paperwhite, including a smoother screen and longer battery life, but the charger that arrived with it did not work--wouldn't plug into the Kindle. If I had not had the one from my previous unit, I would have had no way to charge this one."
Terry McAdams,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It has nice dimensions and the thickness is terrific. Although, it’s terribly slow in processing and downloading books. It comes with no instruction manual, which by the way is a lengthy manual in the book itself. Not easy to navigate through. I would not purchase this item again. In fact, I’m returning this and going with the iPad version."
Paula Monteiro,5.0 out of 5 stars,"love that I can read in low lighting with light booster, waterproof but I haven't taken it to the shore yet. only problem I have had is sometimesI have to go back a few pages before reading again & haven' quite figured out how to do that. Not very nice that the instruction manuals cost $$"
Rob,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, it was a good deal price-wise but I totally missed the note at the bottom of the description advising that ""ThereB is a Wi-Fi + Free Cellular Connectivity device available."" I was going to give this as a gift but I wound up keeping it. By the time I noticed this, the return period had lapsed. I have purchased several Kindles for myself, and as gifts, and ALWAYS opt for this feature. The device itself is just fine but now it irritates me every time I see that little WiFi symbol. Again, check all the details thoroughly folks - as I should have done!"
NDH,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I mostly read at night, and I like white text on black. I'm disappointed that this device won't do white on black.
It's also just a little large to hold sideways in bed and still be able to swipe the page."
R. Elizabeth Brooks,5.0 out of 5 stars,This slim reader along with the case I bought can easily be dropped into a handbag for portability. The battery life lasts long enough to read an entire book. The simple downloading of books through Amazon make it a real treasure
Buff Sessions,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lost my last kindle on a flight had to have a replacement immediately. Great choice
Happy mom,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm loving the screen - it's more responsive. I've seen reviews with issues with font clarity = I have not noticed any issues at all.
James Green,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Screen touch response time is very, very slow. Some thing about the interface are not intuitive. Books I’ve purchased from my laptop are not always easy to find on the kindle after they’ve been purchased. Tracking on current place in book should provide a unique indicator per screen. Page not percent give an accurate indication of where were last and through accidental presses on right side sometimes harder than it should be to find where you were."
WendellBee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So handy - I do love “real” books but this little Kindle paperwhite is so handy. I tend to want to read something as soon as I think of it. There are good deals or free books available too. It’s compact, you can read in the dark, adjust text size, brightness etc. very happy with it."
jandemom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very happy with this one! It is a bit smaller, but the touch screen and built in light are awesome. For years, I have been trying to read with a book light clipped on my old Kindle. It was doable, but not super convenient. I am loving the built in light, and love that I can adjust the brightness."
Lacy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say? If you travel, enjoy reading in bed at night while your partner sleeps, read several books a week or month, or ride the subway, the Kindle is the way to go."
Vicky S,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Having been a Nook user for several years, it's taken a while to get used to navigating the Kindle. But I love the smaller size and the backlit screen of the Kindle. My biggest complaint is the battery life--I've had to charge it 3 times in the less than 2 weeks I've had it. I don't know if that's because of the light or the fact that it's connected to wireless all the time. With the Nook, I could disconnect from wireless and get up to 6 weeks on a single charge. After having a full charge yesterday, I'm down to 70% today. Granted, I read about 6 hours, but I think the charge should be more than 70% now. I'm switching to Airplane mode to see if that helps."
Steve,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The biggest problem with this is the lack contrast. I want to be able to read this in a dark room and not hurt my eyes and not light up the room. If used with a white background, I need to turn down the brightness a lot so as not to be overwhelmed. However, then the black text is too dim. If using the black background, It is not black enough and still lights up the room in an annoying way. turning it down dims the white text too much. There is simply not enough contrast. My Ipad works marvelously for this. In the bright daylight the Kindle will excel. Also, there is no setting to do text scrolling like on an Ipad. I miss that feature. Third, the unit is much smaller than I was expecting. That may be good or bad depending on your preferences!"
S. Marr,5.0 out of 5 stars,I received my latest Kindle (my 4th after losing my 3rd I know not where) and found it easy to set up and very easy to use - just what I was hoping for.
KWK,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was most disappointed by the Kindle Paperwhite's limited screen brightness and zoom capability combined with the device's failure to support my *.AZW4 files, which were originally purchased and downloaded from Amazon. The Kindle Fire is a far better buy."
A. Vallis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a Kindle fan for years, and this newest model is great. It's easy to use, has a few more bells and whistles than my older paperwhite, and the waterproof protection is a great idea (especially for travel!). Best Kindle yet!"
George K,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This product shuts itself off too quicky and there is no control over this ""feature"". The closure process cannot be stopped when it begins to shut off instead of being able to be maintained open by touching the screen. The cover does not have a magnetic auto open feature making my old cover useless. The waterproof feature has no attraction whatsover if it is supposed to be a big deal. If/when I find my old Paperwhite which I misplaced I will go back to it immediately."
ATK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first e-reader (other than a regular iPad). I am very impressed. This thing is feature-rich; waterproof, Bluetooth to connect to a wireless Bluetooth speaker/car, and comes in my favorite color- blue. It has tons of storage. I have no complaints, I am a very satisfied customer.

Also, used/refurbished was a great idea and tremendous value imo."
ragamuffinrabbit,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The screen seems smaller then the previous models of perhaps the size seems smaller because I am use to reading the kindle fire. I love the resolution and ease of use compared to old models and other types of e-readers. My favorite feature is the ability to read anywhere. With the e-ink display and waterproof feature, my kindle is now my go to device for my reading pleasure. The only thing I still wish it had was auto adjust brightness."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reposting update amazon sent me back my original kindle that I used for trade in.
Thanks amazon
I love everything about the kindle paper White except for the lighting it’s way to bright hurts my eyes. You can adjust the lighting however it still hurts my eyes with a nice headache. It’s either to bright or to dark to read.
I traded in my 1st kindle for a credit towards Kindle paper white and because I’m sending back the kindle paper white I’m losing my 20% credit and amazon won’t send back my original kindle that I received the 20% credit for."
kassimer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this kindle. Reading at the beach and pool and not worrying about it getting wet was wonderful on my last cruise. I used to have to put my other kindle in plastic zip locks to read on vacation. This was so much nicer. I can't wait til my next cruise, the oool hasa bench built into it and i will be sitting in the water reading, so relaxing"
carpenter,3.0 out of 5 stars,"What I don't like--The home screen is cluttered with books they are trying to sell you. My old kindle had 3g and I could get a book any time. The new one you have the find wifi. Not as easy to hold but that's more the covers fault. I got it, i'll use it but i would not buy another one. ( the lighted screen is nice )."
Morgan,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I want my 7th gen back. It got a scratch in the screen and it was out of warranty. And, I couldn’t find a 7th gen in stock on amazon. So, I just bought this one. First of all, it takes like a minute to come out of “sleep” mode. My older version was so much faster. Secondly, the battery life seems to only be about a week and a half. My old kindle could go for more than a MONTH without a charge. I managed not to drop my last one in water, so I’m not sure why that’s such a huge selling point. But, I’m really disappointed in this product. When you make a new version of an older product, one should probably not mess with what made it great."
KC2SF,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cannot charge because the cable microport does not fit into the device. Now chatting with CS.
Alexis Taylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from my standard Kindle 2016 to this and I can’t believe I ever went without it. Battery started at 60% out of the box and after 6 hours of reading and about two hours total of playing around with other features it’s only down to 44%, which to me is pretty great.
It’s the first e-reader that I have ever owned where I like the feel of it so much more without a case; it fits so perfectly in your hand as you read.
The only two complaints that I have are how easy it is to get smudges all over it, my previous kindle never got any kind of finger prints on it, and I wish there was a way to adjust the temperature of the light. Other than that, I think this is the best kindle for the price and I am SO happy with my purchase!"
Rajasekar Raja,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best things for ebook reader. It redefines the whole system for book lovers. I love the lightweight sleak design. Very good and perfect if you are an avid reader
Lightening,2.0 out of 5 stars,"What I like this kindle most is the light weight and small size. It's so easy to carry around and doesn't feel much weight. The wake up response seems slower compared to my iPad. So is the overall processing speed.
What's most disappointing is that the charging cable (came with the nice looking kindle package) does not fit in the port at all. It's hard to believe such a poor quality control is associated with Amazon's top brand product."
JT,3.0 out of 5 stars,I am not pleased. It is fine but my battery does not last as long as what other people are saying. Looking at your list of books is not that clear. I think a bit of color would help. Reading outside is fine and the weight is fine but trying to learn how to use it and the battery are not up to par.
Fr. Jerry Ochetti,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a Paperwhite. Still the best reader out there! My older one is a Gen 6. The feel is very similar to my older version but the ridge less screen is much nicer. The extended battery life a good upgrade as I frequently read with no power close by.
Rachel,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always been loyal to the Barnes and Noble Nook but decided to give the Kindle Paperwhite a try in hopes that the battery would last longer. After 6 months of ownership, the battery lasts just 30 minutes before it needs to be charged again. In contrast, my 5 year old Nook still holds a charge for several hours. In addition, it's very slow to wake up from sleep mode. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this!"
Jim B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good upgrade from original Kindle V1 (that still works after 10+ years!). The new Kindle has great features and makes reading much easier and quicker. My only issue is getting the touch screen to open the menu options from page view. Lots of time get a page turn instead of menu popup but probably only a ""user"" issue."
Softball Mom,3.0 out of 5 stars,It does read very nice. Love the no glare and reading in sunlight. The responsiveness of the screen is slow and it’s tedious to use it for shopping for books. The advertising that pops up while it loads is annoying. I prefer to shop on my phone with the Kindle app and then read on it later.
Ceesar,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My previous paperwhite was a couple years old, so when a good deal came up for the latest gen paperwhite, thinking it would be faster with better battery life.

Turns out I was wrong of both - I actually find the current paperwhite to be slower than my last one, and the battery life to be shorter. It’s not just mine, but a second current gent paperwhite I bought at the same time.

Quite disappointed in this latest one, I feel like amazon dropped released paperwhite that feels like a step back."
Mark Spencer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Less is more. Great product. One challenge...very hard to highlight and take notes. The touch screen is not very accurate and/or sensitive. If I could I would give it a 4.5 - the internet access (wi-fi) is kind of glitchy and not very reliable. To download a book on the road is very ""iffy."""
MAXIM,2.0 out of 5 stars,"1. Just try to imagine that you are holding say 1000 books on your device. And all of them are shown in one plain list in the library. There are collections but their use is very limited. Unuseable. Why Kindle cannot navigate/display usual folder structure - I do not understand.

2. You still can turn the page by one hand only. ANY reader from the most competitors divides the screen by 9 tap zones and you can assign any function to all of them. Amazon should be really dumb to continue ignoring that absolutely necessary feature for decades.

And many more crazy ""no, never"" moments. Very good device, perfect screen, reasonable price, etc - but absolute fail in software UX."
KBK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded my Paperwhite to the newest version and sprung for the no-ad version and I love it! What a relief not to have to have ads for books that I don't want popping up when I open the reader. The longer battery life means that I don't run out of power very often....only have to charge every other week. It also supports audible books, but I have not used the function."
Mary Z.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A few years ago i bought the original Kindle and I thought ""this is the best"". Well, this new kindle is even better! More compact with huge memory to carry dozens or more books with you. I can fit the Kindle Paperwhite even in my small purse. I take it on trips, lunch time at work, medical visits, etc. etc. Very happy with my purchase!"
review3,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the new Kindle paperwhite--after getting used to a MUCH smaller size. My original Kindle was full.

When I received it, Kindle asked me if I wanted to download the 2 books paid and waiting. I said ""Yes"". Kindle downloaded them and Titled it ""Kindle 2"". For 1 week this was fine. THEN I ordered a cover for from Kindle, I liked it and placed my KPW in it. 1 week later ALL THE BOOKS I HAD PURCHASED ON MY ""kindle 1"", WERE NOW ON MY ""KINDLE 2"". THEY ARE ALSO ON MY ORIGINAL KINDLE.

CAN ""SOMEONE"" PLEASE ADVISE ME. ON THIS PROBLEM, BEFORE I RETURN EVERYTHING."
Juliano Neves,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was not sure if I would get used by read using Kindle, but it was a good surprise. Having it always available makes reading much easier. The light weight makes it easy to always have it around.
The software is still very slow, and the pages and touch screen take long to respond. As it's supposed to be a book and not a super speed tablet, I don't think it's an issue.
One down thing is the price of the books. Sometimes it's the same price or more expensive than the physical book. It would also be good if purchasing the physical book, you could get the Kindle version as well... Maybe one day..."
DC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I lost my Kindle in Feb 2019 in an airport and of course it was never found.. Thought I could get along without it and just read a regular book. Well, what I found is that I stopped reading all together. I purchased my new Kindle during Prime Days a find myself reading a number of times a day. Thanks to Kindle!!!"
Dario Jhangimal,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like that is very portable and easy to handle.
The only bummer is that I would love to have some colors (specially in book covers) and a faster processor. Nevertheless, i am very happy that i decided to buy this device, I can focus on my reading instead of beeing worried about notifications, battery percentage, sicze of the screen, brightness or glare. Non to mention that i can have many books at hand wothout carrying a bulky and heavy pack."
Aqua003,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s difficult to rate this product when it arrived in a defective state. I charged it upon receiving it and then set it aside until I was able to find time to use it. Unfortunately, it didn’t work by the time I wanted to use it. Initially I thought the battery had ran out so I attempted to charge it again. Still does work despite my many attempts to trouble shoot. I hope my replacement won’t be another disappointment."
Northghost,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Did not plan on trading in my 2015 Paperwhite but I saw this on sale for $90 plus a $25.00 trade-in, too good to pass up. While there are no major changes, the improved backlighting is noticeable to me plus the flush screen provides a better tactile feeling. The bluetooth and improved storage is not important to me but may be for others. Glad I made the change,"
Wizard96,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Kindle years ago and it was huge as compared to my Note 8. This one is as tall as a paperback. Just the right size to get in my back pocket.

The touch screen leaves a lot to be desired. Sometimes it is as good as my phone, other times it delays like a Windows computer and other times a barely touch goes 3 pages.

All in all, I'm satisfied."
Cristanne B. Swanda,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am enjoying this device, but still trying to learn more about it. Trying to figure out if I can get books loaded on it from places other than Amazon."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really like how it reads more like a book. I have had the original Kindle (still have it), a Kindle Fire (let my husband have it because I did not like it) and now the Paperwhite (which my Mom stole from me because she liked it so much). It is very easy to use (my Mom does not like computers!), easy on the eyes, larger screen that original Kindle. It also has a lot of options (font size, background shades and the intensity of the brightness) that can be changed to make reading easier, especially for an older adult with vision issues. Hence, why my Mom hijacked it. I guess I have to just buy another. :)"
jane,3.0 out of 5 stars,i was disappointed to discover i needed bluetooth to get text to talk. it's a nice device but i wanted to plug in my ear buds and listen like the first kindle model. i had the thing up and running when i got the message it needed bluetooth. i asked chat before i bought this kindle and no bluetooth was mentioned. So i'm saying it here for others to know in advance.
Rees,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The ads on the sleep screen never seem to be for quality books. Why do I have to see ads again? I paid $130 for this thing. The response time is sometimes slow, seems to lag when going back to the Home screen or another main screen, but I don't really notice it when turning pages."
Quirky,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I could not live without my Kindle! It goes everywhere with me - just in case I have a chance to read between other happenings. It is so convenient at night--no more lights to bother with.
Always find new books to download - no more library trips.
Absolutely love it."
William A. Neill,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice little reader. I’ve always used the native Kindle app on my iPhone and iPad but decided to give the Paperwhite a try. I like it. Just the right size and weight and the backlight is the perfect illumination. Excellent for outdoor reading. Tons of storage. I won’t go back to the “old days”.
James L. Shaw,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is very handy for when you are out and about. We camp a lot and having to take books all the time was a pain and it was very hard to hold them in bed with a light as well. With the built in light and touch screen it makes it very nice. I'm just getting used to how to navigate and how sensitive the touch is. And there are enough free books (now) that I haven't even hooked up with my local library yet to see how that works.
Sharon Wedegaertner,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my Kindle on June 19, 2019 and one month later it does not work. It has been confusing to navigate through purchases as well as my library. The size is nice and it does have a long battery life but it doesn't do me any good if I can't use it. For $149.00 I am disappointed the return expired on July 19, 2019. One month! If I can't return it then I guess I will settle for a replacement. Please instruct me on what steps I need to follow to replace my faulty Kindle. I would also like to say my older heavier Kindle was a much better device."
Tobborah Cottingham,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this. I can now read in the dark as well as reading in daylight. The size is perfect for one-handed bed reading. It has capacity for a lifetime of books. Sometimes the touchscreen needs more pressure than I think warranted to turn pages but it isn’t enough to deter my enjoyment.
Judy Coombs,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Getting books on your Kindle is very easy and with some plans can be swapped out once they have been read. It is like carrying a library in your pocketbook!!! The paperwhite gives the experience of reading a ""regular book"", but you can control the size and font of the print. I highly recommend using this electronic device."
Sandy O,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love love love my new kindle paperwhite. I have one of the original kindles that I was using to read outside. But had to use a cover that had the built in light. This kindle is backlit and has a touch screen so it’s lighter and much easier to use. I have a kindle fire that I use as well, but the paperwhite is now my go to book kindle."
Sophia Rossano,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I only got this only because the charge port in my first paperwhite barely works any more (poorly made, same as the Fire tablets). Like this versioning, but it’s missing all the default dictionaries that came with the first version. Just another way Amazon is squeezing more money out of customers."
Maggie May's Mom,4.0 out of 5 stars,"One would think that with a rather expensive purchase, by anyone on a fixed income, there would be a hard copy of instructions included in the purchase instead of everything explained in the Kindle itself! You have to go through the instructions page by page and believe me there are numerous pages, then you probably won't find it!!"
Jess,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this as a gift because I was using the kindle app on my phone. So far I love it! The screen lighting is adjustable so I can read in low light and it still has the “paper” look to it so there’s no glare if you’re reading in direct sunlight. The direct access to goodreads and other features is a great plus for those who use that site. My only complaint is I needed access to WiFi to get all my previously purchased books and I did not have that while hunting. An easy fix. All in all a great addition to the home for avid readers!

The features"
Ruth L. Chitwood,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only had my new paperwhite for about 3 weeks, and it keeps going off----no special time. It goes completely off, when I am reading, and I have to close it and open again, to get it back on. I hope to return it for another one, before 30 days are up. I was disappointed since my first reader was so good. Not too happy with the new paperwhite.;("
Stephanie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first kindle and I LOVE it! The screen closely resembles book pages and I love being able to browse amazon and grab a book quickly. My only complaint is the touch screen is not very sensitive - as an iPhone user, I’m used to a very easy touch. This one takes a harder touch and sometimes I have to click buttons multiple times for it to register. Otherwise, great purchase and a happy customer."
kat,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had 3 other kindle versions, this backlight is extremely too bright at its lowest. The last 3 settings done even dim. I read at night to fall asleep and this can be annoying. Other than that it works great like the others."
carol,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Inferior to reading books on IPad and IPhone.
Paperwhite description should read Black and White. Like the 1940’s and 1950’s. The Apple e-books for sale are in color and vibrant not dull, and colorless and titles much more difficult to read. There is nothing much to recommend the Paperwhite vs the IPad. Wish I had saved my money."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a 6 year old Kindle Paperwhite. Open the case and it is ready to read. The rubberized case fell apart several years ago but the Kindle soldiered on, just press the power button to wake up.

The new one is very nice, glad it's waterproof. But now when I open the new case, it takes several seconds to wake up, with an ad on the display until I swipe it away. And the home page has doubled the rows of ads for new books. I shop on the computer for books, I already get emails for new ones from Amazon, I don't need them on the device as well.

Otherwise, works like my older one. A bit brighter and easier to read, same weight and ease of use."
PMC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is so slim and lightweight, you can almost put it in your pocket! I got a cover for it right away, because it's so sleek that I was worried about it slipping out of my hand. I especially love that I can read in bed without any extra lamp on. It's also easy to look up vocabulary words and different characters in the book. This is a HUGE improvement over my old Generation 3!"
Margaret Kuebler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this new Kindle Paperwhite to replace my original first Paperwhite because my battery just wasn’t holding up any longer. Wow, glad I did. This new Kindle’s battery seems like it lasts forever. Loving that I don’t have to worry about it anymore. Definitely recommend."
The Rainbow Druid,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It technically works fine, but I find it is incredibly slow and difficult to use. I was excited for this, but I've simply gotten too frustrated to continue using it."
A Rose,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Product works great, but I hate the pop up ads. I tried to turn them off in settings but they come up everytime I turn off the kindle book. It is like an ongoing advertisement. The older model had wonderful visuals of pencils and typeface. If I had known that I would be bombarded with ads for books I have no interest in, I would have thought twice about purchasing this product."
peaches,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I enjoy the waterproof feature and thin light weight design. The screen is easy on your eyes but less sensitive than a other touch screens that I have used. I find the battery life does not last a week, but did not run out on a long road trip with over 13 hours of use. Easily pairs with Bluetooth headphones to enjoy audible books.

You can easily adjust font styles and size, and I find the predicted read times to be accurate."
Kindle Lover,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The ads claim that the battery lasts for weeks. I had to charge my first pw every 2 days (yes, I read a lot) and hoped for a longer life. I made it thru 3 books in 3 days before having to recharge. I had hoped for at least 4 days of battery life so I'm slightly disappointed but overall love it. I've had a Kindle since 2011 and don't know what I would do without it."
Bethany Tod,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Doesn't hold a charge, battery drains extremely quickly, very sluggish and slow to respond. Had I known how bad this one is, I never would have traded in my previous version. Now I'm looking to replace this hunk of junk with the old version."
kiara,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s small enough to fit into my bag and take up almost no space and the battery life is INSANE (I use it everyday and still haven’t had to charge it in a week).
The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it’s not like the other kindles where you can go into night mode, or adjust the lighting color, and all that other high tech stuff. It’s a little laggy and seems old school but maybe that’s just because I didn’t read into it too much?? Either way, it’s worth the buy if you’re looking for an easy and affordable eBook option. I do still love it!"
Tulvan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Its light-weight, easy to use, is very easy to read in sunlight or dark with the backlight. The ONLY things I can think of to moderate my gushing are first, it does heat up in direct sunlight, but that's rather a ""duh"" statement. I also hit the on/off button on rare occasion when I'm holding the device. That's it. I can't think of anything else I would change even if I could!"
Briana MacDonald,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the Kindle Paperwhite! My husband got me it as a gift and I love it so much! I am a huge reader and I am also working on being more eco-friendly. As much as I love physical copies of book, I decided to make a switch and man am I happy I did. The Paperwhite is just so convenient. You don't have to worry about bending the spine of the book, your book falling and losing your page, or feeling like your wasting paper (as I felt). All of the feature are amazing such as: fonts, size of font, boldness, reading at night, small and can easily fit in one hand. Everything about it I love and I am glad that my husband got it for me! I would recommend to anyone who is looking to read E-Books!"
ChicagoDan,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is my third touch-screen kindle and I LOVE them (lost last one). The only issue: confusing to match to cases...size of new 2019 Paperwhite is ambiguously listed in various cases...had to return one before I figured out how tonorder... and Amazon Support was NOT HELPFUL...actually recommended the wrong case to replace the wrong case
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros- compact size makes it easy to hold. The viewing is great and the built in lights make it easy to read.
Cons- every so often you find yourself on a page, or chapter that is random. For example, you are on page 100 in chapter 10, you 'turn' the page and you are in chapter 16, or in one case at the surprise ending of the book. Talk about a spoiler!
this seems to be a common problem with this model and I hope a new FW release is soon coming as this is very frustrating.
I would give it 5 stars, but the random page jumps makes this a 3 at best"
Randy Gotthilf,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product. The setup was a problem. The Kindle started in Japanese. It took two different online chat sessions to change it to English. Over 2 hours in Chat. Fortunately the Customer Support is excellent and once the problem was correct it became a beautiful thing. Very easy to use. Holds more books than I can read in a year.
Always Already,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my third Kindle. I loved them all. The battery in my old one was starting to fade and Amazon gave me a killer deal on the latest PaperWhite along with a trade in for my old one. An easy purchase decision.
Graham,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a Christmas present for our 13 year old son, and we opened him -- or tried to open -- a ""Teen"" account, since Amazon's website claimed we could share books from our family account to our teen. After that didn't work, I spent part of Christmas day reading forums of similarly befuddled parents, all the way back to 2017, wondering the same thing -- it simply doesn't work. Pretty disappointing Christmas gift! Amazon started as a bookstore, and had we bought physical books, loaning them to our teen would be a ten second job ending with a hug. Amazon is no longer a bookstore, that much our family (and especially our 13 year old) have learned for sure."
alyssa,3.0 out of 5 stars,The backlight is WAY too bright. Noticeably brighter than the previous generation at the lowest setting and uncomfortable to read on. My husband bought the new generation Oasis and that is much better.
Melissa Thompson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to use, very responsive to touch. Love the Bluetooth features. I have been very happy with it. With it being water resistant i stress less about taking it with me everywhere."
Mack Mcgowan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had several versions of the kindle, including a couple of paperwhites, and this is my favorite so far!"
Rick C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this new Kindle! It has everything I ever wanted on an e-reader: built-in light; crisp, clear fonts which I was able to customize to my preferences! Smooth, fast. Long lasting battery. Bluetooth connectivity to listen to books!!! And, to top it all: waterproof! Never have to worry about reading by the pool or even IN the pool!

Awesome!"
avsmaine,1.0 out of 5 stars,"While waterproof, unit is slow and touch screen buggy. After 34 days touch screen has now totally locked up and having to be mailed back to amazon. Chat support with tech very slow, 4-5 minutes between responses tonight. This is fifth kindle purchased and feels like a big step backward in speed and use."
Barbara Clauson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my first Paperwhite from the first time I used it in 2014. It was still working well. I upgraded because I wanted more storage and the waterproof feature. The new one weighs only slightly less :-( but has a totally flat screen, making it easier to clean. I love the new one and recommend it. My only disappointment was that I thought I needed a new case, but the old one would have fit."
Dianne123,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Several people on here are saying their cord is defective. That is not the case. The cord works fine on other devices with a micro usb port. The problem is with the port built into the Kindle itself. Since this is a known defect, Amazon should pull all of them from the market and recall all of the defective ones they have already shipped. It is BS that their ""solution"" is to send out one non-standard cable. This means for the life of this Kindle, you will have a device that uses a non-standard charging cable. At the very least amazon should send every customer who got shafted with this thing, three proper cables (long length) so they will have spares to use for travelling or whatever."
Champion of the Underdog,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like that it's thinner and lighter than the old model so I can easily carry it in my purse
FRANK OQUENDO,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an upgrade for me since I have a Kindle touch from 2012. Weight seems more or less the same to me. The built in light and the ability to choose the intensity is great. It says it is waterproof as well I have not tried that yet. Anyone looking to upgrade should consider this item and people new to kindle should as well.
Kellie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery is very long lasting, easy to read at night and in the sun. love the book selection and best of all? I dont have bags of paperbacks sitting around needing a home! I have craft and cookbooks on it- fiction- and 2 technical manuals downloaded.
I really cannot say anything bad about this."
Ozzie Alfonso,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm finding it hard to read the small print in many books, that's why I got the Kindle and it works perfectly. The ability to change fonts and font size is what I needed. On the down side - I wish I didn't have to see an ad for books when I turn off the Kindle. There used to be a way to get rid of ads for a small extra fee, but I can't find this in the new model."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite is great for someone who prefers paying more than twice as much for a black and white TV than a color TV because they don't want the distractions of color! I know, it's not a TV. Just saying. If you need to read in sunlight, probably a good device. If you already own Amazon Fire tablets (I own several), do your reading on them. Fire tablet $50, Paperwhite $89-$129."
Deborah King,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the new Kindle Paperwhite. It's thinner and it's fits my hand better. I usually read before I go to sleep, so I couldn't survive without the built in light. My eyes are strained by the time I get around to reading since I am a writer by day into the late evening hours. Having the ability to change the font size it a huge plus."
Teresa,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Kindle Paperwhite is smaller and lighter than earlier versions. I liked the case I ordered for it and the easy off with the close of the cover. That being said, I found the Paperwhite very hard to read without eye strain. The glass is similar to what is on non-glare glass photo frames which slightly distorts the image. With my astigmatism, I tried resizing and also changing the font and brightness but this model was never easy to use. I originally bought it to be able to read outside in the sunlight but if I can't use it inside I'll try to read with the Kindle app on my iPad when outside. Disappointed with the product, but the Amazon return process was very simple and fast."
Kiki's Bookshelf,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've become very fond of my new Kindle. It is every bit as great as advertised - well done, Amazon!"
Gary M. Lent,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been reading Kindle books on the iPhone Kindle app for years, so I guess I expected more. I was shocked to learn that I wouldn't even have the option of a black, 'nighttime' screen or even sepia. It's just so...basic"
offthegrid,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very handy. I was running out of book-shelf space. Only bad thing is maps are too small to read, and I read a lot of military history. By the way, if you bought one with ""special offers"" AKA spam, you can call a guy in India and have the special offers removed for about $20."
Patti Kloida,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had my previous kindle for 6 years with no problem except recently it hasn't been holding a charge as long. So I decided to get a new one. I got the same on although it now comes with several added features. I love it just as much as the previous one which I still use as a backup. My kindle gets ALOT of use!
elizabeth ridenour,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this product Christmas of 2018 and the battery has gone bad. Because it’s January 2020 and not December 2019 when the kindle suffered this fate, the best they can do is 20 percent off a new one...which is no better than a random sale price. I expect better quality and for Amazon to stand behind their products. Penny wise and pound foolish as we buy a ton of kindle books."
R.D. Young,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My new kindle is backlit, so I can read later at night. I love the ability to change the font quickly for my weary eyes if I've been reading too long.

My only problem is that the charging cube recommended for this is so wide that I cannot use adjoining outlets while it's charging. I have to unplug, which is a pain."
Kristin A. Weidenaar,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a replacement for a Kindle Paperwhite I had for six years that would no longer work. I was very happy with the one I had before so that is why I decided to replace it with another updated one. So far it has been great. It stays charged much longer than my former one.
Oregon Rain,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There is NO COLOR, none in the book covers, and while I can download magazines, all the pictures are gray and fuzzy! I wouldn’t have bought this if I had known there would be no color anywhere.
My original Kindle had color! It is faster the Paperwhite and I will use it as I spent over $150 for item and cover."
TNTinker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the clarity of the screen, even in sunlight.. Purchased it because it is waterproof and I am going to take it to the pool this summer. This is my third Kindle purchase and they just keep getting better. However, would like a model in the near future to encompass the whole screen, similar to the new iPhone."
Kim Jones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My Kindle Gen2 died and I got a Paperwhite. Nice on the size and clear reading. My problem is I have been use to having my books in order so when a new book comes out, I can keep everyone in order and reread some to update myself if it has been awhile before the new book. Now they are just random and if I don't have the titles written down, I might not reread the right book. There might be a way to list the titles without a cover picture but not found that yet. So still confused about what is offered or available to me."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very disappointed in the device. I have only had it 11 months and it will no longer charge. I have tried multiple charging cables from multiple sources so I am quite sure it is the device itself. And although one would think this is a defect, there is really no way to contact Amazon about a return."
Susan Wilczynski,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have always loved this product, which is why I upgraded to this version. It’s so much better for my eyes that a tablet and I can use it if I want to read in bed without bothering my spouse. On top of the great quality, I just want to thank Amazon for doing away with all of the bulky packaging. Streamlining means it’s a bit more sensitive to environmental concerns!"
reader,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok. I loved the new kindle. Waterproof building light etc. But the promise of weeks with NO battery charge is a lie. The battery life is same , of any device. I am very disappointed with that. I charged my kindle 2 days ago fully and now is 40%, so it lasts less than my Samsung tablet."
Kacey Largent,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm tempted to return it and buy the new Fire. I don't like how tied to Amazon it is. It's not compatible with all of the library apps. The light is quite bright when reading in the dark. Brighter than my cellphone. The touchscreen is too sensitive, and it's almost impossible to click on words for definitions that are too close to the right margin. It just turns the page.

The battery power is awesome and I got a really good deal on it during cyber Monday. Maybe I'll figure out how to adjust the lighting and other solutions to minor annoyances I've experienced."
Theresa Wells,5.0 out of 5 stars,I do like this kindle but I am used to my kindle fire which navigates a little different than this kindle. It does have great battery life and you get no glare when reading outside which is the main reason I purchased the kindle paperwhite so I am very satisfied with my purchase.
birdie80,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased one of the new Paperwhites. Almost twice the pixels of the one I have been using the past 5 yrs or so. Also double the storage. The type is very clear and I set it to have just a little background light. My eyes aren’t great and this Paperwhite is so east to read. I also got it on the payment system. Made the item immediately affordable.
Ruth Knox,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my original Kindle Paperwhite for the newest one. It was hard to part with my original Kindle, since we were always inseparable, but I did it. I wanted to take advantage of the waterproof and double storage features of the new one. It was shipped promptly and before I knew it, it was in my hot little hands. I loved my old one and I love this one even more."
Lady Prof,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the Kinde Paper White. I have problems with one eye but I love to read. I use my Kinde along with Audible on my Echo. The text is easy on my eyes. The size of the print is adjustable. The Kindle’s small size is absolutely perfect. I bought the cover that goes with it. It’s light and well designed. Turning the book on and using it is easy.
The Reviewer,3.0 out of 5 stars,I switched from gen 3 to 4 because now I can be ready to. But the software isn't built for such complexity. It can not read to you and you follow along with book. I.'ll stick with the fire. Waste of money. Better bang for your buck with Kindle fire. No more e-readers for me.
D. Gillette,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ignore the dummies complaining about the special offers, which are simply book recommendations, and only show up when the device is asleep, i.e. when you're not using it. Who cares!!!"
Susan J. Dunham,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had several different Kindles over the years (I always have two - one in my purse and one by my bed), and this is by far the best one. It's so light! It's replacing a Kindle Fire that I really only ever used for reading, but it had been cheaper at the time but boy is it heavy! This new one is awesome, though I haven't tested the waterproof feature yet!"
HFS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best reader for the money. It’s lightweight but large enough to read comfortably. The battery lasts for a really long time, I read every day and I only charge about once every 3 weeks. I recommend a cover, it’s very thin. If all you need is a good reader, this is a perfect option."
Pat G.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I previously was a ""Nook"" owner/reader.....after repeatedly trying to replace battery and constantly having to recharge my Nook, decided it was time for a change. Nook's customer service was virtually non-existent. Did totally enjoy my Nook however. My husband purchased the Kindle Paperwhite for me for Christmas. I really like the size and read- ability however it didn't come with as many ""options"" as did my Nook. No email, no games, to name a few. The one issue I have with the Kindle is in previewing books to buy. The font size doesn't seem to increase and the print is very tiny. Unless I am doing something incorrectly I can't seem to change it. I do not have this same issue upon selection and reading the book as I am able to increase the font size. Overall seems to be a great little reader. Would recommend."
UA,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle was my Birthday gift from my husband. I was very excited to get it. But when i received it, seems to work fine except with the screen dragging issue. I initially thought that as a new device its setting itself but now it seems to be a major problem. It really takes more than 3 minutes to turn the page and the pages also get overlapped sometimes. It is really my worst experience with this New Kindle Paperwhite. It takes tooo long to ON, Unlock, going to the next page. It really sucks when the screen drags."
Douglas D.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not quite an upgrade from my previous Kindle (last seen on an Austrian Air flight). This one costs more, is slower to start up and shuts down spontaneously, and is then a bit difficult to get restarted. If this continues to happen, I going to demand a replacement."
Pink Zombie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, I Love my Kindle! I was on the fence about going digital for books but I am actually Loving it and reading more! I like the size of the Kindle Paperwhite. It’s easy to carry and keep nearby. I did purchase the leather case for it in plum and it’s beautiful and gives it the “book” feel. The only negative is there is a bit of a lag on the touch screen of the device (ex. swiping, tapping, typing, or trying to connect to WiFi) I am enjoying Kindle Unlimited and my absolute favorite has been purchasing “Great on Kindle” books that you can get a credit back to use for buying more books!"
Alicia Sanchez,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had 3 kindles. The first was a gift. This is 2nd Kindle replacement I've ordered. I don't like with each new order the changes that have to be relearned to set up as the previous ones, sometimes learning curve is frustrating. Would be nice if one's old set up could be transferred same as when ownership info is. And then owner can have option to change based on new options. But that's probably just me..."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this kindle to read my favorite authors on. I have had no problems. I often go for kindle unlimited and have had a great difficulty returning a book to make room for a new one. If I finally get one returned I often have one waiting to download and I am told I have already purchased this book so it won't download. Would appreciate having this return process built into the e reader. This way it is a time consuming process.
D. McCormack,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle Paperwhite (previous generation to this one) was fine, but this one seems just a little but quicker in loading pages, etc. Even though I can read on my iPhone, iPad, computer screen, whatever, I always go back to the Kindle. Love the light weight and screen."
Kimberly Saunders,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have loved every single one of my kindles going back to 2009. The older kindles had games tho, that are no longer available on newer paperwhites. I accidentally left mine on an airplane and the new one doesn't have the capability of having the games, or it's a ploy to get you to buy a fire as well. It's still the best reader in the world, but it was nice to have a little game to take up a few minutes of mindless down time."
Delaware Diva,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle Paper White replaced my ~10 year old Kindle. What an improvement. I loved my Kindle and used it every day, but the Paper White is even better, I love the built in light the touch screen in fact I love everything about it. If you chose a Paper White you will not be disappointed, you will wonder why you waited."
kvs,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Received this as a gift. Love the back light. I have another kindle and some differences I've noted is that this one usually needs to wake up first before swiping to read whereas my other one is automatically on when you open the cover. Also this one reverts back to icons for the books instead of remaining in ""my library"" mode. Otherwise, love it and use it everyday."
alsugarbelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,What can I say? It’s a Kindle. I like them. I am one of those people who doesn’t have to be holding the actual book to enjoy it.
Sarah Dowd,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to get a new kindle after my old one starting having screen issues. Newer one took some getting used to...which is fine. It’s different I get it. BUT the battery life on this newer version is atrocious. I’m having to charge it every week, even when I DON’T use it regularly. I wish I could get the older version back. For me it makes no sense to have the kindle if it can’t hold a charge."
Drenn Workman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I do wish now that I had bought something a little bigger.
If you turn the light on the battery diminishes much faster."
Dnvrgal,5.0 out of 5 stars,First one received did not seem to hold a charge. New one sent and it would not load books and the font would keep changing in the middle of reading. Finally got original one to work properly and returned the replacement. I love my Kindle hope this new one continues to work.
Avid Reader,4.0 out of 5 stars,I am happy with my Kindle except for a couple of minor things. Every now and then while I'm reading it will flip back one page. I am also having trouble finding my entire library that was forwarded from my old Kindle. I am still learning some of the new features and how to use them so this may be my fault. All in all I love my Kindle.
R. J. Fennell,3.0 out of 5 stars,It freezes. No does it connect easily to WiFi. It takes getting used to. I like the size. I hate having to lose info because of difficulty connecting to WiFi. I am reading Crazy Rich Asians and needing my iPad nearby to follow story. Maybe extra $$ for cellular is worth it too bad though.
Pam & Pugs :0),3.0 out of 5 stars,"No timer, doesn't always connect to other Kindle devices and you can't find your place. Can only listen to Amazon audible, I like borrowing from the library,too. I knew it doesn't have immersion reading, really miss that. Takes Blue Tooth headset only, more expense than plug in. Wish I had just bought another Kindle Fire. Darn! :("
Bean,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it. I wish there were something akin to a sepia tone, and I wish it still played music (preferably Bluetooth), but those are all of my issues. I thought it would be a pain having the power button on the bottom, but I read in bed with the bottom laying on my chest or stomach and it’s never turned off."
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like it fine but there is so much that I don't know but if I did I might love it. One of my big problems is when I get to the end of a book I end up having to completely shutting down in order to type in another book. I am not able to browse to find another. If I didn't still have my fire, this would be useless to me."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this one because after 5yrs my old one had a crack in the screen! This one is much lighter, basically the same! Battery is supposed to last much longer between charges but not that I can see, about the same! Supposed to be waterproof! If I ever fall off a boat while reading I will try to remember to check! At 20 degrees or so the screen gets fuzzy!A real problem for me is that if I add a book I have to go through 80 some pages to find it. My old one had all my collections listed first then a list of non collection books beginning with most recent purchase! Easy! Maybe this one can be set up that way but i haven't figured it out yet! All in all I'm ok with it but really very, very similar to the old one and not as convenient as to organization!"
David G. Cohen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had this model for about a week. Is an improvement over my older keyboard model. Text is very clear, battery life seems good and access to functions an improvement over earlier model. Dictionary lookup much easier. Page turn is sensitive but quickly get used to keeping fingers away from screen. I opted for not removing the ads, which are not a problem."
b deumite,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My new Kindle Paperwhite has been waking up for over 24 hours. I can not turn it off....nothing works. I am waiting for it to die down and hopefully when it is out of energy, it will reboot somehow and work again. If not...back it goes. Thank goodness I still have my old one and can read on it or I would be really, really upset."
Barbara Ubert,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this new Paperwhite because my previous one abruptly stopped working in the middle of a book I was reading. I have owned a Kindle since the first design and the Paperwhite is definitely a much-improved product since the first iteration of Kindle. But this Paperwhite doesn't seem to have any great new bells or whistles. As a matter of fact, I find that it seems to have difficulty turning the page when I swipe. I seem to need to find its sweet spot and tap hard to get the page to turn. Very annoying! Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I don't think so."
Paul Richmond,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Tiny little screen with poor visibility.

Garbage"
J B B,4.0 out of 5 stars,My last paperwhite lost its ability to charge after much use. I would Have re-ordered that model if it had been available. This current model does not come on instantly it requires waiting time. Otherwise works as well the other Except I remember having a longer time between charges before the battery failed.
Helen,4.0 out of 5 stars,The light is good. I wish I had bought a lighter colored cover but that is neither here or there. I used to touch the bottom to get the amount of time left in the book before but now I have to hit the area quite a few times to get it. It also not lighter in weight than my older version.
M.F.G.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this Paperwhite 4 to replace a Nook Simple Touch that finally gave up the ghost. All in all the Paperwhite is decent. That said however, the touch screen is just a bit ... ""touchy"". It's very easy to move several pages at a single tap. Irritating but not a game changer. The battery life on the other hand is a definite disappointment. I know I read more than the tested 1/2 hour per day but having to recharge every other day is a major irritant. My old Simple Touch was significantly better. Notwithstanding these two deficiencies, the Paperwhite 4 is a reasonable replacement for my dearly departed Nook Simple Touch."
MaryJean Kancel,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything was great while reading the first book. Now, the Kindle Paperwhite randomly displays the font size selection pop up and just freezes. It also randomly jumps to other pages even without touching the screen. This is despite restarts, deleting books & redownloading (happened within multiple books). Just frustrated & ready to toss it."
Prairie Moon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought I would trade in my 2 year old Kindle for the latest one due to boasts of longer battery life, etc.
First, my device suddenly shuts down when I am reading. No movement on my part.
The battery life is certainly not improved, and might even be worse.
I tried to exchange it within a month of purchasing but they said I would have to pay postage and then wait for replacement. Not giving up a week or two of reading to do this. Customer service rep tried to help me with this but wasn't allowed to process my request.
Think twice before buying this model."
James E.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Handy way to carry both my technical and recreational libraries with me, and avoid using the space they eat up in hard form.

I can check out a new Kindle book at the local library at any time day or night on my computer, without ever leaving my home or paying for shipping."
anisahs gma,1.0 out of 5 stars,Where are the special offers...........Also where are my books that were in my old kindle......this new kindle is completely empty. Am I expected to repurchase books I have already paid for . This is kindle number eight for me. your kindles don't last very long. Now you burgal my books. This will be my last kindle and I will be returning it. Are you going to reimburse me for my books..............
S.Argo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not what I was expecting. First its smaller than i was expecting, the layout is not the same as or as easy to us as the kindle app, and the power button is on the bottom so it easy to shut off accidentally. Its great for reading outside, but the other short comings do not make up for this one positive. Would not purchase another one again."
valda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hesitated to get a reading device because I loved the “feel” of books. I have changed my mind; I am now addicted to this wonderful Kindle. I don’t have to worry about going to the library to get or return books. I can read at night without disturbing my husband, I am hooked!"
Susan Spreadborough,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this kindle to replace my very old kindle touch. I like that the paper white is lighter and more responsive than the older tired one. The back light is great for dim rooms, no need for an additional clip on light. I also love that it is waterproof, for by the pool or a relaxing bath time read."
Jerry,5.0 out of 5 stars,I do like the response time. Easy to use changing of text size and the battery life. I have used the light from the screen as a flashlight to walk around the house. I would like a little more texture to the back. A friend looked at it and admired the ease of use. She said that she would drop it because of the smooth case.
zenhen,5.0 out of 5 stars,My older Kindle was not holding a charge any more. I love the size and weight of my new Paperwhite. It is very light. Good for arthritic hands and to travel. It's great that it has a back light. I can read without extra lights on that disturb other people. I do reacommend this model.
Louise Currie,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the size first I thought it was too small but I love it know this is my 3rd kindle and I love it I have all the books in the palm of my hands without having a bunch of books all over the house.
Don Cleary,3.0 out of 5 stars,The 32 GB Kindle is NOT 32 GB. It comes in at 27.4 GB and that includes all the loaded software. Calls to Kindle were met with no answers and after 2 weeks they have not responded as they said they would. This discrepancy is far bigger than any hard drive I have ordered with a computer or phone.
dona crouse,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I do like the new one I have gotten with light. I will say that the new kindle readers in my opinion are so thin that you almost have to have a case!. I definitely would love to be able to use my original kindle which I got in 2009/2010. If I could get a battery I would have it fixed! Anyone who knows how this might happen, I would appreciate any info you can give me."
Kristina Robak,1.0 out of 5 stars,I've had many kindles in the past and the battery life is so much better than this. I took it off the charger at 8am now at 6pm its telling me low battery. I've read for maybe 4 hours total today. This kindle isnt even a year old yet.
T. Reynolds,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought Kindle Paperweights for each of my children so that I could allocate them books to read and books to listen to. I understood that this could be managed under my Amazon Family Library and that the kids could search for and request books they would like to read / listen to and I would approve them. Not possible to have parental controls and offer my kids books to read and listen to. If I want them to have access to Audible then I have to let them have access to my whole Amazon account on the Kindle and the ability to buy etc. Not cool!
JW,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, very adjustable, easily fits in purse. Traded a 2011 model that was heavy, had a larger footprint, was hard on the thumbs and had short battery life. Took a few hours and a chat with customer support to learn to navigate it, and now I love the Paperwhite. Pic shows black Kindle in red cover."
Megan Culwell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for traveling a few weeks ago and I have used it every day since!

It's the perfect size for my purse, and no matter how many times I've dropped it there are no scratches or dents!

The only 'bad' thing is that I have access to buying books 24/7 and my self control is WEAK.

I have noticed that the battery does drain faster than I did when I first started using it and it's only been a little over a month."
Arden Barnes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't ever got any sort of e-reader before, and this one is super nice. It has fantastic battery life as long as you keep the WiFi off. I was able to make the font as small as what looks like a normal book to me. It's basically like a really light book that you can read in the dark if you want. I really like this."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am 68yrs old and will be having eye problems soon. I had heard great things about Kindle so I decided to go ahead and get one. I could not get the screen bright enough. I made myself read a book on the Kindle, hoping to get used to it. It didn't work. I guess I'm just an Apple person. I have the Mac Pro, I Pad, and I phone."
Leagh Weidick,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a regular Kindle this past March and, although I loved it, it didn't have a back light and was very difficult to use at night. I added the Kindle Paperwhite to my Christmas Wish list, but fortunately, it went on a big sale for Prime Day and my husband surprised me with it! I absolutely love it! It has the long battery life and ease of use just like my previous Kindle but also has the back light I was lacking as well as being water proof! It has definitely made my love for reading come back and I can take it anywhere since it fits right in my purse. Highly recommend!"
John Wilker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned Kindles since the 2nd edition. This is yet another excellent device. I love the flat screen and waterproof-ness (is that a term?) It's fast, light, easy to use. The perfect reading device."
Eric,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything I love about the Kindle (see bottom). However, I was surprised by how the battery life was shorter than earlier versions and better placement for the wake button could be considered since I’ve been accidentally pressing and putting it to sleep.

Fantastic UI; easy to navigate
Better, easier highlighting and dictionary lookup
Responsive
Awesome customization with font settings

Overall, I’d give this version an A- but would likely get again if I needed to."
M. Lund,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The papersoft Kindle is not as user friendly as the older models that had your library, keyboard and forward/back buttons that the new one does have but it takes a fair amount of searching to find the way to get where you want to go. On the plus side, it is smaller than the previous models, but the size change is due to the changes in the model."
Kaleb,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s a fantastic reading device. It is much easier on the eyes than a iPad or computer screen. The only issue I have found so far with it is that it’s a little slow compared to the tech I’m used to now. Also the “lock”/power button is on the bottom right side of the device. Being right handed my pinky finger normal accidentally hits it, I wish they would of put the button on top of the device."
Susan A Coventry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I enjoy using the new Kindle Paperwhite. It's lightweight, easy to use, and seems to hold a charge for a long time. I mostly read on my Kindle at night because of the built-in light. I would highly recommend this product to eBook readers."
Greg S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the feel of books normally, I get books from the library, but a recent sale caught my eye and I got one. The waterproof thing was the icing on the cake. I was surprised how small and light it is, but because I can change the size of the letters, backlit, read in sunlight, so many things. Pretty intuitive interface and the battery lasts a week or more."
Dani,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new kindle! I left my last one on the plane, which was very upsetting, so I opted for a blue one for better visibility. It works really well, and is definitely faster than my last kindle."
Night Owl,4.0 out of 5 stars,Only complaint is that it takes a few seconds to wake up and during that time the backlights are on 100% which is blinding at night.
eroc,3.0 out of 5 stars,"A delight to read on and I love that its waterproof. However, the power button on the bottom of the unit is an unwelcome addition, as I'm constantly accidentally hitting it while reading and turning the device off. Hope next iteration moves the button back to the top of the unit."
Tigran Mirzoev,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered it in July on the Prime Day. I was traveling abroad at the time. When I finally got to it, I discovered that the upper part of the display didn't work properly. It was past 30 days return :(. I will now have to send it for warranty repair. If I discovered the issue during the 30 days window, I would surely return it and kept my previous generation kindle. If their quality control is so bad that they ship out broken products, I wouldn't want to take chances and rely on it to work for a couple of years before I decide to upgrade...
My advice is probably to wait till amazon gets its QA to work better."
retiredandlovinit,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic.
I originally had the Barnes and Noble nook which I still love; however, it cracked and I decided to get an Amazon ereader because I was looking at price as well as the non-glare aspect. I CAN read this in the sun. Super!"
Gee,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The touch screen takes time to respond. If the font is changed or a similar action is performed, the screen breaks into pixels and takes time to refresh.
Got a new kids kindle and kindle 10 paperwhite - both have similar issues.
Hard to read those comic books with minuscule text."
Vyas Bharghava,2.0 out of 5 stars,"You're better off using your previous generation Paperwhite and using your Kindle app on iOS/Android devices for a far superior immersion reading - having the ebook open & words highlighted while listening to the professionally narrated audio. On Kindle, it's either read or listen. I traded-in my prev gen Kindle Paperwhite just for the new audible support. Now feel like I've wasted my money."
Cindy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have really enjoyed this Kindle paperwhite. I had the 1st kindle; but it broke. I tried the Kindle Fire, but had so many problems with it that I returned and bought the Kindle paperwhite. It is waterproof, not that I have tried to find out for sure. I am still learning the ins and outs of the paperwhite, but this has not stopped me from loving this Kindle."
Tracie Miller-Colette,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot find anything I don't love about my new Kindle. It is User Friendly and perfectly fits in my purse. I ordered the Kindle Cover for it and it conveniently ""wakes up"" when I open it and goes to sleep when I close it. It gives me the ability to read anywhere!

I look forward to having the newest one with color in the future."
Em,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am OBSESSED!! I’ve had the amazon fire and hated it. Super glitchy, no memory, and it was always dying on me. This little ereader is a different story!!! It’s so tiny! I can fit my whole library in my smallest bag, I’m thrilled! I love that it’s not a tablet, it’s literally just books. I purchased the kindle with the 32GB and I have not had ANY storage issues!! Also, the kindle unlimited subscription is TOTALLY worth it. Not to mention the kindle ebooks are WAYYYY less than Nook books. So happy with this little guy!!"
Lifeinthe10.40Window,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I almost didn't buy this after reading reviews. I received mine yesterday, so it's hard to evaluate battery life accurately so I based it on my previous one. I figured my previous one was great, so this one probably is too. Having said that, I love everything about this one. It's lighter, more compact and I love that the screen is one flat surface without an edge around the reading screen. It's so much easier to tap corners for bookmarks, etc. Thank you, Amazon, for creating an e-reader that I can read around water. I know I will enjoy using this for a long time."
Kathryn Schultz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an old 3rd generation Kindle that died several months ago. I bought the new paperwhite as a replacement and I love it. The battery definitely doesn’t last for the promised “weeks” but so far mine can last about a week before needing to be charged. I typically rent ebooks from my local library and I love being able to return them directly from the Kindle home screen. I’m also finally able to read before going to sleep without any other lights on. Overall it’s been a great investment.

If you’re looking to upgrade from an old model, I would definitely recommend getting a Paperwhite."
Joe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this thing, I've spent a few hours with it now, and I can say It's definitely a nice way to read a book. The screen is really neat, and it's the closes you're going to get to a real book without actually holding a real book.

I've only given it 4 stars because mine came pre-installed with a bunch of random fingerprints on the screen."
Otto,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very pleased with my PaperWhite. I purchased this reader because I have several textbooks that I need to read and they are in pdf format. I did not like the idea of printing several thousands of pages and I also did not want my eyes glued to a phone or laptop. The PaperWhite is easy on the eyes and I love reading from it. I have now also loaded several other pdfs that I use regularly: sheet music, user manuals, etc. I have only charged it once in the last couple of weeks and I read all the time!
I am very glad that I chose this for purchase. I love it!"
wolfman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this for my wife for Christmas as she was constantly making trips to the book stores and then standing there for a long time trying to find a good book. She absolutely LOVES it and it is so convenient to review books prior to buying and the Amazon specials that are constantly being offered are great !!! One of the better gift ideas I have ever come up with for her !! Wish I would have done this a long time ago.
L. J. Silton,4.0 out of 5 stars,The only downside to this device is that in order to preserve the battery life the wifi and bluetooth should be turned off when not necessary to use. I put it into airplane mode and it is fine. I turn it on when getting new books. The colorful case is fine and I found no problems with it as others have stated. Amazon Kindle customer service is wonderful.
Sissywlb,5.0 out of 5 stars,I would change the design of it if I could so that it is easier for me to grip when laying down and reading. If the margins on either side were a little wider I could hold it with one hand without turning pages. The Amazon support for kindle is great. I got this after surgery when I had to limit my activity. I had forgotten how good it is to just read.
Aquila Barros,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle! I already read Kindle a lot on my cell phone, but a few months ago I did start a having severe headaches, and one day realized that there are no headaches after spending two days reading books on my mobile device. So I decided to buy the Kindle due to reviews saying that it was great for reading because it is a good for eyes. so...my Kindle has arrived , and I read 3 books in 1 week and nothing about a headache. I'm so happy for that! I love my Kindle. It is perfect for lovers of reading. conquered me in an everlasting love. Thanks Amazon!"
M. Davis,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only issue I have with this new Kindle is it doesn't fit my older case for the Kindle. It is just a bit too small, so the device falls out of the cover. I had to use velcro to get the device to stay.

The power button is exposed & easily pushed if you hold the device on the bottom."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was very disappointed. This is my 3rd Kindle. The switch over from old one to new one on the previous Kindles worked great. This new one however has been a nightmare. What’s going on with your company? Went to the store to re-buy the books I couldn’t find. There they told me they were in my library. Then I pressed library and they went to my library. Long process, but it worked. Please help.😃"
Irish eyes,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have charged this item at least 5 times. The battery is barely lasting 1 1/2 weeks. I have the airplane mode turned on or off, whichever takes me off the WI-FI. I had an older kindle and bought this because the battery was not holding a charge as well as it once did. Well this one is not much better. The screen also appears much smaller than my old kindle. Aside from these two flaws, I am perfectly happy with the purchase."
Linda,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good value I guess if all you want is a gray scale text reader. The refresh rate is slow, you know, turning the page. And the menu isn't as easy to get to as on my phone, unless you're able to find the sweet spot. TBH, the experience is more pleasant on my phone using the Kindle app."
MAB2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Paperwhite to make reading more comfortable. I read constantly and had been reading mostly on my iPhone because it was handy. It was a strain on my eyes, however, so I got the Paperwhite to make reading much more comfortable for me. It works well for that purpose."
Linda Butler,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would have given it 5 stars but I don't care for the power button at the bottom. It is too sensitive and has powered down at the slightest touch too often. I also wish they had kept the page turn buttons. It was so much easier to touch a button than stop to touch the screen. That may just be me, I have arthritis in my hands...so there you go."
Barbara Poyneer,4.0 out of 5 stars,I moved up from a Kindle so old it had a keyboard so the touch screen took some getting used to. The way it arranges books and collections also took some getting used to as it was a complete change. Not sure I like it yet. Accessing the footnotes is difficult. All too often touching the footnote gives you a page turn and you have to keep trying until it works. This is especially true along the edges of the screen. I also wish there was a way to enlarge maps and charts to make them easier to read. It'll take me time to master this new way of using a Kindle.
Phyllis Evans,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my 2nd Paperwhite. I love this one too. It is a little bit lighter and easy to set up and operate. I like the upgraded storage capacity and being able to listen to audio books by way of Bluetooth. I carry it with me most of the time..
TemporalCraig,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a good kindle choice. It holds it charge for weeks and the built in light is a nice feature. I have several kindles and this one is pretty easy to navigate and the fact that it's waterproof is awesome (although I haven't tested this out yet). The only design flaw I've noticed so far is that the power button is located on the bottom of the kindle. I often prop my kindle on something to read and when I did this, the kindle would turn off. Once I figured out what was happening, I was relieved but it is still annoying. Apart from that, though, great kindle. I'm not rushing to get it wet but I am much more comfortable reading in the pool area now."
Kathleen McGill,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I DO NOT LIKE the new format. It shouldn't take 3 clicks just to find the book you were reading when you turned it off. I find that the battery dies rather quickly whether it's being used or not. Down to 50% daily without any use at all.
I bought it as a new Audio device, and that, so far, is satisfactory. (still 3 steps to get to book) I just find it takes a very long time to download the audio.
Never could understand why changes are made, when what you had already worked admirably. (I dread 'updates') I wish this device had the same format of the past Paperwhites! So very much easier to use those."
Barbara K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I especially appreciate that this kindle is so easy to customize for my reading comfort. Although I have no plans to submerge it in water, I'm relieved that a few drops of water will not ruin it. I have used it for several books through my local library so far and I'm amazed at how well it worked."
Andy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I enjoy the ease of reading the text on screen, I'm blind in on eye and have glaucoma in the other and it's still easy for me to read, I use the features to adjust the font size and make it bold. I love it very much."
Barbara Henderson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to read off my cell phone and it was fine, but I often ran out of power, and it was weird holding it. Now those problems are gone. My Kindle is comfortable in my hand, always seems to have power, and my phone doesn't die so often. Love the bold and font options."
EMDER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the new kindle paperwhite. This is my second Kindle and I appreciate the improvements. There are many devices to read on: computer, phone and tablets but nothing is better than a kindle. I enjoy the slimmed down version and the waterproofing and audible add. Good work Amazon. If I have one suggestion, make a white version."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved this product for the first 3 months of using it. Everything worked well until last week. When the battery would run low I would charge it, never letting it get down to 0%. This happened for the first time a few days ago. I charged it for 2 hours and the screen still said it had 0 battery life. I left it to charge overnight with the same result. I also tried different outlets and different cords all with the same result. If possible can I please replace this product for a new one? I’m very sad because this kindle was quickly becoming my favorite thing."
MSmith,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had a Kindle Fire for years and resisted buying the PaperWhite. Should have purchased the PaperWhite a long time ago! It is SO much easier to read by the pool! Love the size and my new cover too. Only disappointment is you can’t reverse to black screen to read in bed - even dimming the white screen is still too bright. But I guess I have my other Kindle for that.
Francisco,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned several Kindles. This is my first paperwhite and it has been a dissapointment.
1. The battery last a lot less, but this is understandable for the in built light.
2. The touch screen is not as responsive as the one from my previous Kindle and this is annoying. This device is more slow in every aspect."
AnonymousWalrus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery on this lasts forever. I always forget how long I go between charges because I probably go a month or more, even when I leave WiFi on. Thanks to the fact that it’s waterproof, I now read while relaxing in the tub without worrying about getting my book soaked. This is probably one of the best things I’ve bought myself in the last several years."
Diane Pepe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Kindle user for many years. I needed a new one because my second edition would no longer hold a charge. Truth be told, I am not excited about the newer one. Simply not as user friendly as the older models. Getting to the home screen is a pain. Nice to see the ""book cover""of what you're currently reading, but there are times when I want to look at another book for a recipe and still haven't figured out how to get there. The paper white is the nicest feature. The cover that was bought for this one makes it noticibly heavier. My daughters bought this as a gift, so I don't mention my issues, but I wish I had just replaced the battery on the old one."
Kate Overath-Speck,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am unable to charge the Paperwhite due to a faulty USB cable. While Amazon is replacing the cable at no charge, I have to pay the associated shipping costs, which leaves me with the proverbial bad taste in my mouth, esp. as this problem is well-known by Amazon at this point. Requiring a customer to pay shipping for a replacement part because the original was faulty is cheesy on the part of Amazon. Also, I would prefer the screen to be larger as I have macular degeneration and the small screen will have diminishing returns in the not-too-distant future. Maybe when I'm able to use it I will be more satisfied with the device. The shipping fee will continue to rankle."
Donna W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After years of reading regular books I notice my finger joints were giving me a lot of pain. Finally decided to try Kindle and I love it. I can adjust the font, spacing, background light, etc. to conform to my visual comfort and so easy to hold, however, purchasing the case with stand built in makes it even easier for me. Easy to use as well once a friend showed me. Instructions are a bit long and somewhat confusing for me but I am 68 now and am technically challenged. LOL"
Tito,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First paperwhite with a decent screen, no more ghosting finally. The device feels pretty light and I love that, but it's very slippery, I had to fix that with a pop socket (see pic). I really like using the “invert black/white” option when is dark at night. That Kindle logo in white is super annoying, but at night I don’t even see it. I wish the power button was on top to avoid accidental shut downs. I’ll probably never use the waterproofing nor the bluetooth but it gives me a peace of mind knowing that I have it. This is not the perfect eReader but its good, and you are in the Amazon ecosystem so even better. I've got mine at a discount price and then paid $20 extra to remove the ads. I’m reading more and I’m enjoying my reading much more than before so I’m happy. I hope this helped you a bit, good luck."
Lainee,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This kindle is great. It’s my first one, so I’m going through a learning curve with all of the different features. I wish it didn’t show fingerprints so much. The way fingerprints showBig is borderline, ridiculous. Lighter than a lot of books. Easy to fit in purse or bag."
JRH,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sadly, I ""traded up"" from my Voyage to this new paperwhite and I HATE it. The battery life is terrible, there's a big lag time when it's waking up or shutting down, it seems to get covered with fingerprints in a way my voyage and old paperwhites never did. I do not recommend. Get the old paperwhite instead. Or buy one of the few remaining voyages."
JoAnn ONeill,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th Kindle, the first three got worn out. This Paperwhite is great. The battery life is amazing. I was used to charging every day or two and now I can go four or five days and I read every day. The backlight is all the light I need when I read in bed. I can't imagine my life without my Kindle."
kassie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"heres the thing. i hate amazon and i hate jeff bezos (hi jeff!), but i LOVe my kindle. i got an original kindle for christmas roughly 13 years ago and i loved it for all 13 years. just recently it started acting out and i decided i should get a new one. i chose the kindle paperwhite and i am NOT DISAPPOINTED! i've already completed my goodreads goal for 2019 (20 books) and it's only Feb 19. honestly i feel shame for contributing to mr buttface's wealth but i'm suppressing it. all in all i'm satisfied with this stupid capitalist purchase"
T. Kraft,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased several years ago, the first gen of Paper White and loved it. For a vacation in Europe I decided to do the Amazon's upgrade program and purchased this new Paper White and love it even more. Mainly the brightness and white-ness of the screen is improved and the higher res display shows images and text sharper."
Zack&Neki,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my new kindle paperwhite this light makes life easier specially at night, but the battery life it is not that long kind makes sense because it does have a light on it is like 2-3 days until you gotta charge again (what it is not bad) my last one lasted a week without charging but did not have a light on."
Judy T.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never disliked a product so much as this. I've had a Kindle since 2016 and LOVED it. Unfortunately with my arthritis my unit was too heavy and bulky. So when the paperwhite came out I was thrilled.
However getting it up and running was an arduous task. Bad directions, not user friendly, not easy at all to upload my books. When you come up with a better solution, I'll stick with my old Kindle (my friend)."
Victor rtvela,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle paperwhite is a perfect alternative for printed books. It is practical to have thousands of books at hand and reading any time.
I was told that reading from Kindle can't be compared with the the experience of reading of traditional books, but for me, Kindle experience is even better.
What I would like to be improved is the Ergonomics of the device diring one hand reading and the power button location, which is on most uncomfortable place, the buttom. During the reading, it is so easy to accidentally press it and the device goes to standby. Better to have power button on the top
Also better to have even more books available for Kindle reading."
Andrea,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it, I bought it as a Christmas gift for my husband, it is so difficult to get him something and finally I nail it. He is so happy, already purchased books and started reading again. The size is perfect."
Samuel Purnama,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s easy to carry everywhere. Simple design. The ads don’t bother me. The e-ink technology is quite magical! the sensation is like looking at the real paper! The light screen really helps to read in low light and even in the dark. yes, it does have glare, but it doesn't bother when reading. the touch screen is somewhat less responsive. Never compare it with your handphone if you don't want to be stressed. We should a little patient because the touch screen is a bit slow."
PJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Upgraded my four year old Kindle White. Absolutely love the new upgraded version. My husband also bought himself one
jsumr110,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is such a disappointment to me. I was looking for a simple reader but this was just a flaky thing that seemed to frequently hang and stutter . Loaded with bloat. Not clean at all. does not link with android devices. Slow!!!! Screen had a glare despite reputation.
Monylee,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that it had a built in light, great for travel. I won’t have to keep using my iPhone to read my books or carry one. It’s lightweight and great for a long plane ride.

I do dislike that it doesn’t have a navigation menu for the book. I keep on clicking a link and it won’t let me. So the screen thing just sucks. Other than that, I give a 3/5.

I love reading so I don’t need so many things for a tablet. But fix the damn screen options."
Pamela J. Veenstra,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this latest Paperwhite, and am experiencing an annoying problem: It will not turn on, EVERY TIME I re-open the cover. It will not turn on when I use the button. The ONLY way I can rectify is by holding the power button until the child-under-tree graphic appears. I wouldn't mind If this happened rarely, but I have to do this type of restart about once a day!"
Melinda Lamprey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I admit to being a snob where books are concerned, wanting to read only physical hands-on books, but as my library has finally begun to dwindle, I have turned to digital. Having my little Kindle is perfect! It weighs nothing, fits in my bag, the battery lasts forever between charges. and I can take it anywhere.

The ONLY drawback is there's no strap or anything on either the Kindle or the cover I purchased, which for my arthritic hands can be clumsy and painful. Other than that, I love my Kindle and would highly recommend it."
Lynda Maybruck,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love reading from my Kindle and have since it was introduced. Am on my 4th Kindle. However, one thing that bugs the heck out of me is not being able to see the title of the book on each page. It's on the Kindle app on an iPad (which my husband reads from. Why can't it be on the Kindle device? Please?"
Blue Rose.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like everything about it. I bought an extra Kindle because I wanted to put all my Bible's, concordances, dictionaries, Hebrew and Greek lexicons, and all the Christian teaching books that I have. Do I like Kindles??? This is my 7th one. What do you think???☺️💜"
Philly,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love that the Reader fits in to most of my purse without taking up a lot of space. I can carry it with me and read in any conditions. It has a great battery life and I only charge every three days. I read books about 10 hours a day. I really enjoy this kindle. Only dislike is that it is very touch sensitive.
Amanda S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got the 32 g so I could hold endless books wherever I went. My resolution this year was to read more. So far this device has helped me achieve my goal. It runs smoothly and is easy to read in any light. The battery life is crazy long. It is a very motivating purchase.
Zebra,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not as reliable as previous model. Has experience the Kindle being stuck and/or frozen twice in the 4 months since I bought it.
joan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth Kindle. I am older, and it is hard for me to hold a heavy book. Having the lighter weight Kindle is easier on my hands. Plus, I know that I will always have access to a huge library of book available to read on it. It is a smaller Kindle than my first three which is perfect as I can stick it in a purse if I want to take it out of the house with me. It is user friendly."
jo iverson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: I love the size and weight. I love the ads on the wake screen with suggestions for books to read. Shopping and buying books directly from the kindle is AWESOME!
Cons: The touch screen is sometimes difficult.
I’m disappointed that you can’t listen and read simultaneously."
John,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paper White is a great device for reading books, magazines, etc.
My only negative comment is that it does not support any games, which my previous Kindle did.
Again, overall it is a great device for reading books."
Brittany,5.0 out of 5 stars,I swore i would never go the way of electronic books because I’m a book nerd and i love the feel and smell of them. But after becoming a mom i will say it’s a lot easier to pickup where i left off and store more books in one place. I actually love it. Not getting rid of my real books though!
KEJ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this because of it's waterproof capabilities as I usually read while brushing my teeth, washing up, etc. I had never had any trouble with my 6th generation Kindle but this gave me some extra confidence. However, my battery life was better with my old Kindle. Hopefully, the waterproofing performs better or I will feel that I totally wasted my money."
Terry K. Chapman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's small enough to put in a jacket pocket, light enough to carry everywhere. I enjoy the various light settings, bright when outside and during the day, dim to read at night without disturbing my husband's sleep. I can read in a totally dark room. It's so easy to change the page, I thought it would interrupt the reading process, but it only takes the slightest touch, hardly have to move my finger. The font can be changed, with numerous options for bold and for size. It's easy to charge on my pc...takes about four hours so when it's necessary I plug it in during evening when I'm not reading. I can get ebooks from my local public library so many books are FREE! LOVE IT."
yunah,3.0 out of 5 stars," Is this how it works??? I just tried to expand the wikipedia and it falters like that. It's my first use, and because the product wasn't wrapped at all, I am suspecting that something has gone wrong."
Jen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice improvements over my older Kindle. Like the larger storage capacity. The Kindle is my go to device for book reading. I don’t read on my phone (too small) or my iPad (too large).
Would love to see improvements to the adding books to a collection feature."
Agnes Salvin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm new to the Kindle, but love it (I'm elderly; my son introduced it to me on Mother's Day). I love reading and have a large assortment of authors to choose from. The other evening we had a power outage for several hours, but I was still able to continue my reading. I'm happy it is waterproof and includes special offers."
Annette,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like the updates on this Kindle. The layout and ease of use are great. It is lightweight which is nice when reading for long periods of time. The battery life is good but because I use bright light I suspect I don’t get as much as the average person would get. Overall I highly recommended this Kindle.
Joan Elmore,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the light but I need to make the print larger bu haven't done it yet. You do have to be careful when you are reading something that you do not change the page to quickly as you might have advanced two or three pages without knowing it. Then I just back it up
Bob K,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Would not connect to WiFi. After hours of troubleshooting, I gave up. Every other device in house would connect fine, this would not. Had to return."
Eunice A Sill,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sometimes my touches must be too light and I have to touch a couple of times to turn the page. Sometimes I intend to turn the next page, but I go back a page. Sometimes I click too high and get the menu. Also, accidental touches are a thing, too. The edge of the kindle is not very wide, and as I’m changing my position I can inadvertently advance several pages."
Jean F. Barley,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a Fire 8 and a Fire 10 but I just wanted a small reader that is easy to handle and not have the heavy weight of the Fire 10. I love it for doctor's appointments, waiting in the car for someone else, in the bank lines, etc. I keep it with me always and can grab a chapter in anywhere. Just what I wanted. Love it !!"
MysticLady,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th kindle. I love them. I'm an avid reader and they work great. My last one was abused for more than 5 years. It still works but I decided to upgrade for more battery life. Kindle unlimited is great too, I've found many new authors and great books using this feature also. Keep reading!"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I replaced a 3 year old Paperwhite that would no longer respond to the touch screen. The latest Paperwhite works fine but clearly Amazon went to a slower processor. When I turn the unit on, it takes a few seconds to boot up. The old ones came on almost immediately. Otherwise, I will never be without a Kindle."
Deb,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an avid reader and this paper white kindle meets all my needs. It is easy to operate and super light. This kindle is the perfect size for traveling. Though the kindle is small in size, it is big in value and offers awesome features. Super easy to customize to meet your needs. I look forward to reading every day on my kindle."
Sabrina,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I’ve only had this for an couple hours, but I love it. I do not see the shadows I used to on the older version. In fact I had to return the older version because my eyes could not handle the shadows. This one is the perfect size for carrying around and I love that I can carry thousands of books with me at any time. I highly recommend this kindle!"
Candice R. Lemon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I create a collection, but those items I have put in it are still in the book list as indvidual items. I have to swipe through all those items already bundled AGAIN to create other collections. One could get carpap tunnel with all the redundant swiping. Can't you fix that?

Otherwise it is a great product."
Bangs McCoy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No issues, love that this has reignited my love for reading. If you don't have little curious hands around the house, then upgrading is more of a luxury, I don't have that luxury all it would've taken was for me to leave the other model unattended for a few seconds. I'm glad I traded in, and got a small percentage off a new model. Love this Kindle so much!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was gifted this item for Christmas 2019, and was extremely impressed. The screen is very easy to read, and I wasn't initially aware that it features a built-in backlight, making it ideal for reading in low-light situations. It may be the perfect dedicated eBook reader for text, although be warned that the built-in web browser isn't ideal, and full-color images will, of course, display in grayscale. Still highly recommended."
Barb,4.0 out of 5 stars,"1. I do not want to highlight words or passages, and I don’t want kindle to do it for me!
2. I do not want to change the font size when I’m reading, and I don’t want kindle to change it for me! If I want to change the font size, I will do so.
3. Why does kindle need updating every few minutes? In other words the device does not run smoothly. Surely by now you would - or should - have fixed these problems."
Pleased reader,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The primary advantage of the Kindle is the instant library. I have shelves full of books and no more room to provide for additional reading material. The Kindle Library allows for that additional reading material without having to add more shelves and or get rid of books one wants to keep. I have the tenth edition of the Kindle and the Leather cover that I recently purchased is not only practical, beautiful but when you open. its cover it automatically awakens the Kindle. Battery life is also lengthy and that in itself is worthy of positive comment. respectfully, John Mena"
Beerfish,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle and I've read nearly 1000 books over the three devices I've owned. This is by far my favorite. Waterproof was a big plus. Paperwhite is a nice feature, but requires the back light to be turned up and reduces battery life. Overall though, I do like the back light as I don't have to bring a separate book light with me."
Coral Summer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like it more than I thought I'd like an e-reader, and I'd like it better than books except it routinely skips many pages or chapters when I try to turn to the next page. I'm probably going to end up returning my Kindle, and maybe try the one with the button to flip pages."
Samantha Oaf,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received a Kindle after my Nook decided to stop working. I was a little hesitant to make the switch since I would be losing much of my library that I've built up over the years, but this one has exceeded expectations. I love that it is waterproof as I read by the pool or at the beach and the built in light is a must since I read at night. I was probably most impressed with the battery life though, I can't say exactly how long the battery lasts as I charge my Kindle on a regular basis and the battery is never low. The only small problem I have found is that shopping for Ebooks isn't as easy as it was on my Nook, but a minor issue for an overall great device."
Michael D.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The paper white is much easier on the eyes when it comes to reading. Down side is, finding and scrolling through your library of books is very, very slow. Also there internet browser does not work or load most sites. Shopping for books with can also be slow, I find that I use my kindle to shop for books and then later upload them to my paper white the best solution."
Fernando Daniel Colon Gonzalez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it for my wife and I really love it. The light is not to Shiny, so you can read normally in dark places as if you are reading a book with enough light. The screen looks like book sheets, so as I mentioned before, it helps you to read your books without too brightness."
Jim,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the lighted screen. Can't think of many things beyond that that I like. Hopefully, I'll get used to it...I haven't figured out the indexing system. Even have difficulty finding the book I'm reading after shopping a new title or browsing other parts of the home page."
June,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Kindles! The battery doesn't seem to stay charged as long or longer than my previous Paperwhite. Occasionally it will skip too many pages when you turn the page BUT all in all, it's an excellent product and I love it waterproof and audible! Great deal for trading up also! Thanks Amazon!"
Nikki J.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had the original kindle since it first came out but decided to get something new. I asked around to fellow readers and the paperwhite was the number one choice. I see why it was so recommended. I have read 3 or 4 books and haven't charged it once, the battery life is impressive. The lighting is great, and it's very easy to take around!"
Parker Stevens,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite kindle yet. I love the paper white and how easy it is to read in all conditions. I love the lightweight of it and the size. They hit this design out of the park. I imagine I will be using this for a long time till they come up with a reason for me to change to a different version.
Mickelson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: All of the features that most people love about a Kindle are on the paperwhite. I think the size and weight is great. The backlight is perfect for reading with the lamp off.
Cons: I had a very old Kindle that finally died. It had buttons to advance on both sides of the device. I loved snuggling under a blanket and being able to advance pages without getting my hands outside of the blanket. The new Kindle Paperwhite does require that I touch the screen. But that is the only Con I have found!"
saint4God,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife has the Fire HD, but wanted something portable and for the poolside. She now uses this one for reading everywhere because of its light weight, but the other for tv shows & movies. Excellent addition to the Kindle line-up. I'd recommend a protective cover if you're using it in a room without carpet or for traveling."
J Kennedy,5.0 out of 5 stars,The size and weight are excellent. The response time navigating through the options and reading of the books is excellent as well.
"Kindle Customer mystery fan, B J.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used a Fire for the last 5 years. In comparison to a Fire, this is substandard to me. It freezes a lot and it is hard to manipulate. I still have not found a way to return a book to my account in Kindle Unlimited and have to go to my Fire to make this transaction. I then have to go to end of book to get it out of my directory. I like the longer battery life but realize this is a new battery and will deteriorate over usage and time. I also love the light. I have not checked out the waterproof feature and do not plan to intentionally try it out."
seeker of truth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is wonderful, the only slightly negative thing I can say is that it goes to sleep fairly quickly, and to wake it up again takes a few seconds. Even though this isn't long, when you are sitting waiting for the screen to become active again, it feels rather slow."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My newest edition. I was very skeptical to purchase this black and white only paperwhite. Previiously I had been using an Amazon Kindle Fire , color. This is a smaller object, probably much better on my eyes. I am still getting used to it but overall I am happy with it. Wish it was a bit easier to find a specific page in a book when necessary."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So I bought the subsidized version with Ads by accident. Its seriously awful. Unwarranted price increase given there's no real improvement over last generations... Battery sucks compared to last gens, and serving me a ton of targeted ads doesn't help either.

I hate the thought that every time i pick up my kindle, it records an ""engagement"" metric that shows up in some advertisers dashboard. Honestly the thought bugs me so much I just paid Amazon a $20 fee to get out of the contract.

Just another mechanism so amazon can make more money. Amazon, I look forward to anti-trust action! Put me first.

Yours Truly,
The Customer"
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only thing I don't particularly like it's the lighting. I've not been able to get the setting for the light to my satisfaction. It's either to bright or too dim. Other wise, the battery life is very good, easy to handle, and should definitely meet the needs of most readers."
James Hurst,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I fall asleep while reading in bed, the Kindle Paper-white doesn't hurt nearly as much as my Kindle Fire when it hits me in the face. The long battery life and quick recharge is nice too."
StarAFire,3.0 out of 5 stars,I had one of the earlier paper whites and I traded it in for this one as I love to read in the tub or at the pool. This one allows me to forego the waterproof case that I used to have for my former one. This makes it a lot lighter to hold. The thing I don’t like about it is that I feel like the battery on this one does not last as long as my former one.
Elena S Takaki,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I think it would be worth it to pay more for the Kindle with more features. I recently read a book that had artwork included and could only see it in black and white. However, when I opened the book in the app on my phone, I could see the artwork in full color. Not sure why color is not a standard option. Also, the connection to Goodreads stinks. I can't update how much I've read. Again, I can do more with the Goodreads app on my phone."
jody l mulkey,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I Traded in my white paperwhite Kindle for the new improved waterproof Kindle. It no longer comes in white. I find that the screen is not nearly as bright as the one I had. Also it is so sensitive that it turns pages to quickly. Sometimes when I turn it on I am chapters away from where I left off. I’m not quite sure if this one is defective, but it’s just a let down after my old one"
Hope,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Kindle. I am quite impressed. I like the lighted background better than my husband's old Kindle that required a light to read. It is lighter and easier to hold than a paper book. The touch screen works very well. I played around with it and fairly easily found where I could adjust brightness, portrait/landscape, type size and style, and other options. It is very convenient to pop into my purse and take with me so I can whip it out and read while I am waiting for a client."
NuzhahT,4.0 out of 5 stars," I was very satisfied in the beginning but the kindle went wild after just a week of use. It is taking commands on its own, and even removed one of my purchased book without my consent. DON'T BUY IT. WASTE OF MONEY. I'll update this if and when I get customer support.

Edit: Kindle replaced my defective kindle with a new functional one after I got customer support within a day. Overall, I would say that if you are a book lover, kindle is a great thing to have!"
Dwight Heard,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Tiny black and white screen didn't come close to measuring up to the old Kendall I was replacing. If you like a small display, this is your huckleberry. Very disappointed and returned immediately."
Rhoda Paglia,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my first paperwhite years ago and loved it. It served me true but could tell it was getting a bit slower..... so bought the latest and was so disappointed. The battery life was horrible and the pages turn at the slightest touch. And the option to ""update kinde"" was grayed out as an option in the settings.

Called to complain and received replacement. Battery is better, pages still advance too fast and update is still grayed out. Miss my first paperwhite.....

I am however a true kindle fan....."
Latvian,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this one as a spare for my other one. Great product, great value and great battery lifespan. On the old model it was very difficult to find the on/off switch in the dark. It is a tad easier on the new one."
Casandra,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE this reader, it's perfect. Easy on your eyes, small enough to fit anywhere (even inside a clutch). I just wish you can lock it maybe with a code but other than this, its great. Makes reading easier and faster."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Kindle Paperwhite is the best e-reader I've found. It is absolutely wonderful. I would give it 5 stars from a performance perspective. My only complain is that I have 3 children and both my wife and I read. Thus we have 5 users and Amazon limits my purchase to only 3 devices.
AD,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought it as a present for myself, and I’m obsessed!! The battery life is AMAZING and it holds a TON of books. As someone who has always enjoyed reading physical copies of books, I can’t express enough how convenient the Kindle is. The screen brightness is adjustable too to make it easier on your eyes at different times of the day. If you’ve been thinking about getting a Kindle, go for it! You will not be disappointed."
A. Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Kindle Paperwhite and won’t be my last! Just love it. It is fact and it paired with my iPhone and iPad. I can read anywhere. Furthermore, no matter the device I use, it is taking me to the last page I read.

Love it, love, love it!"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Still a great device, somewhat improved from prior version. Best features - double the capacity for thousands of books, improved readability in bright sunlight, waterproof, and nightlight that still doesn't disrupt one's sleep cycle. Only complaint is that it is just smaller enough than the previous version so that the earlier leather case no longer fits."
Tom Sparling,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this in July 2019 for the back light feature. The product never worked properly. It would not advance the page by touching the right side of the screen. And often times the font screen would suddenly appear as if I wanted to change the font size, when all I was trying to do was advance to the next page. I contacted Amazon and sent that same Paperwhite back for repair. They then sent me back the same Paperwhite saying it had been fixed. Guess what? Same problem. Now I have a Paperwhite that isn't fixed and I'm not sure I can return it. Do not buy this product. Too bad. My older model Kindle never had any issues. But this one is not worth the hassle."
Ameena alfares,4.0 out of 5 stars,"i loved it , its easy to setup and use , but the touch screen delay is kind of annoying
also i think the price i paid is a bit too much HOWEVER they did like 35% discount one day after i purchased it XD
so don't buy it unless there is a discount or something :P"
B1Cowboy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great piece of technology. Wish it had some way to connect besides WiFi, but otherwise, nice to hold - easy to read."
AJEvyDar,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I took advantage of a special offer to trade in my old Kindle Touch. The new Paperwite is smaller, lighter, backlit and easier to hold. The one feature I really miss is “text to speech”. It allowed me to listen to books in the car without having to spend more to get an audible version and separate Bluetooth speaker. I hope future models bring back text to speech."
E. Clark,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I lost my previous Kindle on an airplane. Of course, the airline couldn't find it so I needed to replace it. Picked up this Kindle and I've kept on reading without a hitch. Screen is easy to read and I was able to use my previous Kindle's plug to charge this one so didn't need to purchase a new one."
Brooke,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The device is everything I expected. The battery last very long but I do not keep WiFi or Bluetooth on. The only issue is that the charger that came in the box does not fit; How did Amazon possibly get that wrong? Other chargers fit fine, including the one from my previous 2015 paperwhite, so I’m only marking down one star."
medrkcm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it, this is now my fourth one. Is definitely light weight. Off on button is still located in wrong spot, do easy to turn off while reading. Bought the blue, should have more colors to choose from. Nothing of the negative I wrote would stop me from buying."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not sure why you can't just swipe to get to the pages you want to see like you could with other models. Having to wait for it to ""wake up,"" after turning it on, seems a bit odd to me. It's not a long time, it's just a second step that didn't have before. Best guess, it's too graphic friendly."
Sue G. Debord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very happy with it, it's light weight. Will be nice when reading outside. I found a very nice and inexpensive case for it on Amazon. Many cases didn't work, but finally found one for 10th generation 2018 only. Be sure and check to see if the plug it comes with fits, mine didn't fit and I was given another one by the store it came from."
Gayle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am enjoying my new Kindle Paperwhite (10th Generation). Easy to download books, easy to read in light and dark environments. No glare screen. I recommend!"
Ski bum,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an old Kindle that is the larger one that is no longer available. I was gifted the Kindle Paperwhite and wasn’t sure I would like the smaller screen where I have to turn pages more often. I was surprised that it was a breeze to go from page to page and the smaller size is better for traveling. The old Kindle was not touch screen so I am enjoying that. I am still learning things and have to Google how to do something, but overall I am enjoying it."
Lauren,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love my paperwhite! A comfortable paper-like read that's super convenient to use! Settings adjustable to be just perfect. Battery life lasts forever. Never thought I would move away from a traditional book, but my paperwhite has won me over completely!"
crazymomma,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Received this as a Christmas gift, but just started using it this summer so I could take it on vacation. I was still using a first generation Kindle, so there was a slight learning curve with this one. I like the compact size, built in light. So far, so good!"
hmoney,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My Paperwhite lasted 15 months and the battery is now completely gone. I had forgotten to charge it after I read, which I typically do, and it completely zeroed out and will not charge. And how is there no replacement battery?? Why do we have to buy a new system? Seriously disappointed and I am so glad I never did a trade in with my older Kindles. Those have lasted me YEARS compared to this new one.

So disappointed and I will be telling folks not to purchase unless Amazon replaces my FIFTEEN MONTH OLD Paperwhite (not give me a discount)."
David A. Harris,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVED my original Kindle. It finally died after 11 years. I bought the new paperwhite. Some of the features I really like, but this new format is not as easy to navigate as the older version. I've had to call for tech support a number of times. There is no easy, common sense forum to follow. It's quite complicated."
Mark Schlaikowski,5.0 out of 5 stars,I replaced my Nook with this Kindle. The problem with the Nook was that it had a temperature sensor that would shut the thing down if it was too hot or cold. I couldn't sit out in the sun in the summer or in my tree stand in the winter and read. The Kindle works great.
AKKSKRK,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my husband who likes to read his books in the whirlpool tub and regular books he would fall asleep and the floated for awhile. But this kindle waterproof does work after being dropped in the tub. It was in for about 5 minutes and still works.
Joyce Lin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've read through a few books using this Kindle (novels and graphic novels) and the quality of the pages don't disappoint. The lines are easy to read and the fact that so much of what we're seeing of the pages can be customized to fit our individual needs makes this an even better product. The zooming function for reading graphic novels so that you see one box at a time makes up for the small size of the Kindle's screen.

The battery life also lives up to expectations, I haven't charged it for about a month now and there's still a good percentage of battery life remaining."
mulalla in utah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have makular degeneration and could no longer read on my old kindle. This one is so much easier to read on.
Also like the 6 month of Kindle Unlimited to try for free. Thank you Amazon"
Steven Stack,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Kindle Paperwhite is great, I have had it since January 16, 2019 but 22 days later (on 2/7/19) they reduce the price by $30 and Amazon customer service will not give me a price adjustment. Amazon Customer service only has one solution: to return the Kindle and reorder another one. This does not make sense. By giving me a price adjustment saves Amazon the cost of shipping my Kindle I have back to them and the cost of shipping me a new one. Further, I have spend hours downloading my library to the new Kindle and my time is worth a lot more than the $30 I would save my returning the devise and reordering. Good job Amazon (not your finest day)."
Isa J. Lundy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This replaced the one I had for 5 or 6 years. It's a little smaller than the one I had before, but I was able to make it fit in my old case by wedging a matchbook in. Which is fine.

The only ""complaint"" would be that it takes a few seconds longer than my old one to ""wake up"". Not a strong complaint, but more of an observation"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Can't answer battery life have only had it 2 weeks. The light? Didn't know it had one. So far much easier to read. I do not care for the fact that you have to enlarge the font with each book. Would prefer to have a setting to keep the font the same all the time.
Larry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I asked for this for Christmas b/c I wanted a portable reader that was easy on the eyes. I really love using this thing. Very easy on the eyes, easy to take with me, battery lasts forever. I have the leather Amazon cover as well, works great.

I bought a second one for my wife as well."
Lois Lane,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been thinking of buying a Kindle as I enjoy reading books. My iPad needs WiFi and my iPhone gets emails. I decided to get a basic Kindle on Prime Day. I have not recharged as yet. I got 32 memory vs 8 .

The new Kindle comes out today but this one is fine for me."
Gloria J.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After ordering I was a little skeptical, but after I got it I was amazed. It was lighter, had more storage, although my old Kindle still had storage space, but I could now listen via Bluetooth as well as read! Amazing! Waterproofing was an added perk even though not for me. So far I’m very pleased with everything and don’t regret trading in my old Kindle."
patricia m lawrence,3.0 out of 5 stars,I am having trouble with my Kindle now it’s just over A month old / I have to hold the cord a certain way to get the light to go on for it to charge/ hopefully when things get back to some normalcy Amazon can help me with this product and this problem /I have a year warranty / on the other hand I like the Kindle for reading it serves it’s purpose when it’s working correctly
Rhea Ringgard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only had this device since the end of December. I do find that it is very handy, in that it can be slipped into a purse. This is great for appointments, in that I can now read a book while often waiting. I have not used it outside yet but plan to when our New England weather improves."
Danielle Guardino,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received a new Kindle for Christmas this year, after my old one stopped charging. My previous kindle was I believe 6 or 7 years old so this new one is a huge upgrade for me! I am so impressed with how long the battery has been lasting! I don't think that I have used all of the features yet as I don't care much about bells and whistles, but it was time for a new one and I love it!"
Susie P,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an old version of the Paperwhite for sitting in my pool... this is 10 times better as it has a light, but not a blue light, m goes underwater...and still should work... unlike my former Kindle that took only a brief dip in the pool and quit working... can't wait for summer. Even got the waterproof cover....now it can be used at all my activities as I read every day of my life. I want to thank those who left very specific info on this Kindle... it's everything I wanted in one!!!"
book reader,1.0 out of 5 stars,"after opening the box I have worked on it for nearly forty minutes now, chatting with help, and so on, changing passwords, logging out of amazon, restarting, and on and on. About ready to frisbee it off my balcony."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using the free Kindle app on my cell and I wanted to stop using my cell so much. My very old, 7 year old, Kindle needed to be replaced. I really like being able to drag and drop books within the collection to put them in the order I desire, which can be done on the Kindle app but not on the Kindle device. The Kindle device does not have a way for you to arrange books in order for books that are parts of an extended series. It seems like something you pay for should give you that option if the free app does.
On the positive side, I love the easy to read screen display, lighted screen, the size of the device, and the life of the charge."
Beth C.,4.0 out of 5 stars,The light is more cool then warm. I’d prefer a warmer light. The battery lasts longer if you turn off the light when you’re done reading. It is a very nice reading experience. Less distractions then reading on a phone or tablet. This is my 3rd Kindle and this is the lightest one yet.
Aunt B.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Shocked how much I did not like this Kindle Paperwhite! VERY small, no color, layout & display poor, and also blurry. On top of the visual issues, it was very slow/frustrating going from page to page. Returned it and ordered a Fire HD8 and couldn't be happier."
Yadvinder Gill,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For a $140 dollar device I was hoping screen would refresh a bit faster. this is my first kindle and honestly I'm bit disappointed. They are making a killing by selling these at a premium due to lack of competition. They should consider reinvesting some of that money into R&D. Other than the slow refresh rate, device works are advertised. Also why they are still using micro usb for charging is still a mystery to me, should be USB C."
Maggie-Joan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I turned in an older Kindle for a new one and don't see much of a difference. Same old device hard to navigate, very hard to see images of book covers, but smaller than the one I turned in so can't use the new cover I had bought for my old one.
Very frustrating because I loved my new cover...now need to buy another for the slightly smaller Kindle. The only thing I like about this is that it's a book and not an online toy. I read on it and that's all. Love that part. But nothing has changed, really."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first, I was sceptical. I never thought I would choose the kindle over a book, but I love it. I can take it anywhere and it fits right in my purse! It is very easy to manage. The battery life last for over a week, that's with me using it for a few hours each day. It allows you to adjust the font size based on your needs. I love my new kindle!"
ROBYN CUNDIFF,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What a great product. My favorite summertime activity is to float on my raft in the pool and turn on my Kindle! I will never be without one of these again! I have not put it in a case, because I don't want to get water trapped inside, but have gotten it wet on more than one occasion. This goes everywhere with me. Love the new audible feature too!"
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love being able to have a book to read any time. And I love to be able to bring it with me anywhere. But, I am shocked at how not simple this is to use. Easy to read a book, but super hard to find books, like even the next in the series. Super hard to navigate. You would think that after these being around for so long, they would be simple. Nope. Irritated at how hard this is."
Reckless Rudi,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Nook user for well over a decade, but the prime deal on the waterproof Paperwhite was too good to pass up. I also like that Amazon offers an unlimited monthly reading subscription. The touch screen is not very sensitive and is sometimes difficult to swipe. The power button is on the bottom of the Kindle, right where you would hold it most comfortably, and it constantly puts the device in sleep mode. The monthly subscription is also a little disappointing- the selection of books is not what I expected. This e-reader will be adequate for vacations, but I prefer my Nook tablet for the day to day."
Jacqueline A. Totten,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this device. It is light, easy to use and attractive. So happy to have purchased this for my personal Amazon account. My previous kindle that I still love and use, is on a shared account with my book club and I still use it but this will give me more direct control over the books I buy and read. LOVE IT, thank you."
dma,1.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work for me. The print quality was difficult to read. Anything less than full brightness was poor and full brightness was too bright. Black background was unusable. The only thing I found ok was the setup. Ads were everywhere and distracting. I am going back to reading on my iPhone which is far more versatile.
P. Lail,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it. I’m a book nerd, and I wanted something that could make it convenient to carry. Don’t get me wrong I still love physical books, but
Sometimes the price of books are cheaper to buy using a kindle. I’ve already read three books since I’ve had it over 2 weeks. And with the unlimited, there is so many. Love my paperwhite!"
Faye,4.0 out of 5 stars,A little difficult getting familiar to the new style after upgrading from an original Kindle. The new screen seems very busy and I am still learning to navigate. Wonder what happened to all my previous books as few of them came forward. Still the new unit is an improvement and worth the effort of getting familiar with it.
Leslie A.,2.0 out of 5 stars,I am very dissatisfied with this kindle. The title listings are still in the very fashionable shades of gray so that they are often unreadable. When you try to go to the next page it changes the font. I chose it for the waterproof feature but won't be using it long enough to be near the water. I am using my phone instead- I can read the titles- they can afford color- and it doesn't change pages or fonts every time it moves.
Marge W,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't had a Kindle E-reader for quite some time and I was happily surprised. It works great and the page turns are very quick and responsive. My only suggestion would be to change the position of the power button. I read the reviews and decided to get it anyway. Although I don't use my device at the gym, it still is bothersome and is easy to inadvertently hit the button. Otherwise I love it."
Ali,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never really been on an e-reader train before, preferring actual books than a screen. This changed that for me. I love reading in the bath with a glass of wine, and I always worried about getting my books wet and ruined. No more! I pre-ordered this and haven’t looked back since.
Battery life is great. I’ve charged it twice since it came out on the 7th, and have already read like 8 books with it.
Now all I need is a waterproof case for it, since I am prone to dropping things and I’ll be set!"
Alex papp,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Kindle paper white and I love it. Simple to use, great screen and wonderfully compact. I still love reading hardcover books and always will but it's certainly nice to have this as well."
KRM,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I switched to the paperwhite from the Kindle Touch 2nd generation. There is a huge improvement in the text and ""paper"" quality, but it often has to think for a second or two to turn the page. It is very nice having the built in light. The gets pretty dim which is great, but it is quite blue. The battery has not lasted as long as my old touch, but that may be because I have been running the light about a quarter of the time. It still has a nice long battery life."
Dean OGorman,5.0 out of 5 stars,bought for the mother in law.. she loves it better then all the ones she had before! more space for all the books she has read and will read.. goes everywhere with her and the paper white makes it so much easier on her eyes she can not stop talking about it!!!
Linda Jackson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle paperwhite. This is my 3rd Kindle. It is small, light and easy to use. The battery is holding up very well. I only have to charge it every 2-3 weeks. This is significantly better than my old. But I had it for over 6 years and loved it too."
Gloria Karp,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You can read lying down. The kindle is a size that facilitates comfort. The lighting is perfect. The navigation is easy.
I was a holdout because I love reading books as books. I have been buying one book after another and decided to see how convenient the kindle is. Got it for Christmas and I am completely happy with it. Good design."
LaSteph602,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm disappointed with my experience with this produce. The screen is terribly unresponsive to touch and takes several tries at time. Certain touch points, it's overly sensitive and sends me multiple pages back or forward. I have high speed internet and I can't even get the Contact Us page to load. I sync it regularly but it shows no new items when my other devices, i.e. the Kindle app on my phone, clearly have new documents. It's been a frustrating experience and while it was a gift, I'm thinking about returning it anyway."
amanda willems,1.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t recommend this device latest version much better the lighting and battery are horrible don’t waste your money UCB you have the first paperwhite keep it don’t upgrade not worth it.
Amy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Never thought I’d read on an electronic device vs a real book 📖. I’ve come to love it. With my vision Problem I can increase font , look up a word , the built in light relieves straining. I can hold it in one hand in train , tap to turn page. It’s great !!! I’m glad I made the purchase. The only con is there should be a better way to hold the device! I had to purchase a pop socket holder."
Jennifer Reifert,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon came through for us. We argued that getting a fix for a 2 week old kindle that was sent to us broken was equivalent to buying a refurbished one so they refunded our order completely. We ordered another and it is in perfect working order (my wife reads 10+ books a month so we are sure). Now we are just dealing with double refunds from Amazon because they 'fixed' the old one and sent it back, which we returned causing a second refund. Imagine going through extra effort to call Amazon twice to ensure they take back the refund they gave us. Thats where we are at. But the kindle is great. We get tremendous use out of it. We don't expect to get it for free."
tcmagic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I touch the screen it blinks too much. It’s very sensitive. And for my eyes it’s not clear enough. The scroll bar will scroll a whole page and not just part of it. So if I missed a book I want to see it won’t just go back up to that book and go back up to the whole page basically , On the main page is the blacks are muddled and very hard for me to see.The pages on my iPhone are much better for meeting me. I was looking forward to a bigger surface. You have to buy a Kindle to get the service, I was looking for a bigger reading surface in my phone. My phone is much more clearer and easier to read on the Kindle for me."
James,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from the first generation Paperwhite and I'm pleased I did. The backlight is much more even and bright, the battery is improved, and it is smaller and lighter than it's predecessor.

Only negative is that they are still placing a power button on the base which protrudes. That means that if you rest it against the table it is liable to turn itself off. Earlier Kindles had a sliding switch which was much more sensible. This seems like such an easy fix - recess the button, move it to the top, replace it with a switch, anything!"
Col C,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Tried it for a few days and was not happy with it, bluetooth was not easy to connect, thinking that I could read and listen to book , nope it's one or the other... I will stick with my fire or voyage and audible in my ipod"
Tanner Parrott,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like any other purchase, I was skeptical about purchasing one of these, as I’ve never owned an e-reader before. However, after pushing through my initial doubts (would it be the same as reading with a book?, Will I retain information from reading from a screen?, etc.), I am now very happy with the experience. The device’s size makes one handed reading pleasant and perfect for travel. The backlight is very convenient and can be turned off if unnecessary. I cannot generalize for all books but everything on my reading list appears to be cheaper in kindle format than traditional paperback; that was one of the largest selling points. Also, the fabric case was worthwhile."
Renata H.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Interface is confusing.
WiFi is barely working
Size too small to resemble a book.
Quality of print: bad. Books look like they were copied on old scanner.
The only advantage: you can reed on the beach."
D. Darrah,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the latest model after leaving my generation 4 on my flight. I noticed that it is slower to go from sleep to awake. It is also slower to shut down. However, it does have a feature that I look forward to trying and that is playing audio books through Alexa. I see no improvement in battery life before having to recharge."
Westiemama,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this. I never thought I would, but the matte screen sold me. It is so similar to reading a book. The touch screen is a bit slow, but it doesn't matter. It's for reading not browsing the internet. The battery lasts a good week. This would be perfect if they could make it smell like a book."
Mike Love,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A bit harder to load older titles than I'm happy with, but can be done with some internet searches to rectify compatibility issues, even with proper DRM titles. Wish it was more compatible with other formats."
purplelady,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Received new Kindle Paperwhite with audio ability. Ordered leather case for the unit. Same case I've been using for my other Kindles. The new Kindle is SMALLER so the leather cases I purchased on Amazon don't fit. They're about 1/8th of an inch too big in diameter. When you put your Kindle into the case, falls out."
Kathleen Kupfer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had an older Kindle Paperwhite and just traded it in for the newer Paperwhite. I love the slimmer design and the greater storage capacity. The Kindle charges quickly and the new features are a plus. The only problem is that I now have too many books waiting to be read!
Tad Benson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the convenience, the lower price, and the immediate ""delivery"" of books, the press-to-look-up-words-I-should-know-but-don't feature, and the fact that it's lightweight and waterproof'ish. But it's very slow to charge (half a day), and why, after all of these years, is the power button still on the bottom of the device where your hand/fingers - and any kind of book/magazine holder or flat surface - will depress it? Is that some sort of sacrosanct edict or an engineering, thermodynamic, or otherwise-scientific necessity? Pro Tip: Put it on the top of the device."
Bradn215,5.0 out of 5 stars,Had an older kindle for years... no frills but it always worked. Got the new Paperwhite for a birthday gift and was not that thrilled... I already had a Kindle. But I caved in and decided to give it a try to be nice to the family... I love it. No longer am I looking for the right amount of light to read. I can easily find and manage my collections and battery life is great. Time to upgrade... just do it.
Michael Park,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the simplicity of the Kindle paperwhite. It's not trying to be more than it needs to be. Some things I've had to adjust to: the sensitivity of the touch screen, the navigation, and the black and white screen. The touch sensitivity is not the same as a smartphone, which is a good thing. I don't want it to wake up while I'm carrying it around. The navigation is easy enough; it's the same with any new system, I just have to get used to where things are found. Not a big deal. As for the black and white screen, I was surprised to see how hard it is to see book covers when I'm navigating my library or the kindle store"
Jarmour,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's not exactly what I expected. The touch screen is not as responsive as the Kindle Fire and I miss the color display. Battery life is excellent. I am not wild about the smaller size though I thought I would be. It lives up to its hype but it just doesn't work for me.
Heather,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is exactly what I wanted. I replaced my 2012 Kindle Fire, and decided I didn’t need to be able to browse the internet or play games, since I have my phone for that. So I went with the PaperWhite just for reading, and it’s great. Super light-weight, I love the backlit screen so I can finish reading after my husband turns out the light at night. Also, glare was a pet peave of mine with my old Kindle, and this one took care of that."
Walter B Turner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle started acting funny so I decided it was time for a replacement. This one works well, the screen is easy to read and once I figured out the new software it was a breeze to use. Good battery life. Images are a little better than the old one I had, but if you want image quality get a Fire."
Happy Reader,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't really need a new Kindle, but the price was too good to be true and it is waterproof! I use my Kindle at the pool a lot and it will be wonderful not to have to put it in a plastic bag. I hadn't realized how slow my old Kindle had gotten. The new Waterproof Paperwhite Is perfect!"
James Merrill,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got my new Kindle Paperwhite and it is great! I never thought that I would convert to electronic books as it is hard to beat the real book feel, but when it comes to convenience, Kindle can't be beat! I have a hard time reading in low light but the Kindle does a good job of auto-correcting for background display to make it easy to read. It claims to be waterproof (not sure I would dunk it) so I can use it anywhere without worrying about it. As far as battery life, so far so good. I got it with only 50% charge and it is still going after several hours of reading. The slim profile and size are great for traveling. Now I can take all of my favorite books with me!"
svskiles,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My previous paperwhite touch screen wore out. I use my reader for personal and professional reading material—heavy use. As an avid reader, this device allows me to have as many books as I like. Easy to use. Lightweight works well inside and outside. Recommend!"
Paula z,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The new paperwhite seems to be a better version of the original Kindle. I love the built-in light and the ability to turn it off by closing the cover. I wish, however, that the instructions were in a physical manual so I could try out the features while reading about them; that is my only complaint thus far."
Pat Gagnon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had an older Kindle reader that I traded in for this one. The screen on this is so much brighter! I decided to get it after my daughter showed me her screen next to mine. I no longer have to adjust the font to bold and bigger than normal so I can see the print. The normal set up is just fine.
B. Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very glad I picked this new Paperwhite Kindle up. My 1st gen PW was experiencing battery fatigue and couldn't hold a charge as long as I needed any longer, so the battery life on this new one is much improved from my perspective. I'm also finding that I enjoy the flush mounted screen as it's much easier to clean the screen and hold the device. This new PW is also much more responsive than the 1st gen which is also very welcome."
Hasan Q.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This ain't a bot or paid review like most reviews with 5 stars on Amazon. Lol.
I've wanted to become more regular in reading so I had many books downloaded on my phone but I would never get substantial reading done. I would somehow always get distracted with something momentarily now captivating on my phone. Having the Kindle helped me stay focused and enjoy reading."
Heather R Denniston,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Kindle Paperwhite for an early Christmas present to myself and so glad I did. I love this little Kindle. It was at first, a little disappointing as I was use to reading on an older Kindle Fire with color. However, that soon past as I began reading. The back lighting is easy on the eyes and adjustable. The font is perfect for my eyesight, but that too is also adjustable.
I do recommend to purchase a hard cover to protect the screen as it could get easily scratched or dropped. I carry my Kindle Paperwhite in my purse with me everywhere I go. I use this little book more than my cell phone. Great gift for anyone who enjoys reading."
robert wittschen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"however, the screen is easier to read. It is also lighter and easy to hold for a long reading session. I think battery life is longer. I can read easily on `standard` page display, and do not use the `large` setting. I had to increase the type size on my firehd8. I recommend the upgrade."
Leasa,4.0 out of 5 stars,I received my kindle as a gift after mentioning how I was going to purchase one after the holidays. I absolutely love it. You can hook up your Bluetooth headphones to them but I would rather they had a port option for wires headphones also. The special offers don’t bother me at all. They don’t show while your reading just when asleep or on the home page. I like seeing new books they suggested so far. I would definitely recommend the new kindle
Ari,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I can’t believe it’s 2019 and this is a “recommended “ device for reading... maybe if you have an iPhone 6 . I put it side by side with my normal phone and it’s just so harder to read on. The latter of reflective film for the light makes it fuzzy, the screen is TINY and the interface is useless. Each his own.."
Firelover51,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my new Kindle paperwhite!! Had been using my Fire for reading, but glare was a problem when sitting outside or going to beach. The new Kindle is waterproof with 2 x the storage. Perfect!! Now I have the dynamic duo, the Fire and Kindle. I'm good to go!"
Paula A. Bowers,4.0 out of 5 stars,I upgraded from a previous version because this Kindle offered audio. However what I didn't understand is audio only available through Audible.com meaning I cannot listen to audio books I borrow from my online library. Otherwise great product. I haven't seen a big difference in battery life.
Kurt Camerud,3.0 out of 5 stars,"You cannot ""shut off"" the Kindle -- an advertisement appears on the screen for the duration of the ""off"" period. You must then turn it on, wait for wakeup, then swipe the screen to turn the Kindle ""on"". Inconvenient, if nothing else. Definitely a step backward. The Kindle itself feels thin and flimsy though it seems to work well as an eReader."
Tom U,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This e-reader is my 4th Kindle and my 3rd Paperwhite.
Pros: sleek design, water proof, easy setup, excellent battery life.
Cons: none"
C. Franco,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't had an e-reader in a while and the paperwhite screen makes a huge difference in eye strain. I haven't tried the audiobook function yet, but it set up fast. Already done some reading in the pool! Get the water resistant case and you'll be pretty much worry-free when it comes to reading outdoors and near water."
Lady in Louisisna,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am in the process of returning. I found the screen so small that if you enlarge the type at all, you turn pages constantly. Had the original model for many years and loved it. This is light, cute, pretty blue leather cover, but too small for me to use."
Macie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not like a Kindle really needs a review because we all know how awesome they are and guess what, this one is still awesome. Great battery life. I read it in my pool. I don't dip it in the water but I'm not concerned if I get splashed or something while I'm using it which is nice."
ARHOGS,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was hesitant to buy this as I love to hold actual books. I purchased it when it was on sale and so glad I did. I have used it everyday. I have traveled several times since the purchase and impressed how lite it is and how nicely it fits in my purse. I’ve enjoyed the built in light which is very handy when I read at night as it does not disturb the sleeping hubby. The battery life is great. The touch screen is fast. So happy with my purchase.
Alice T. Cremins,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had 3 previous kindles. Each one lasts about 2 years. I think for the price the life of them they last longer. I read about 2 hours per day .Additionally, my latest kindle did not fit into the case I purchased for the other three. It is about 1/16 inch to small to fit into the case without falling out. What a way to add another $40 dollars onto the purchase."
Charlotte A Reed,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Paperwhite over my older Kindle for two reasons.
1. The light is brighter and less computer “blue” and therefore easier on the eyes. I do think it is a good improvement in that area.
2. The battery life is supposed to be weeks not hours. I am very unhappy to say that this is not my experience. After one or two nights of reading, it needs to be recharged.. I suggest you ignore the promise of long battery life."
Maureen McFarlane,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this kindle! Originally I thought this would be too small to use daily but in the last 10 days I have hardly put it down and as a result I am tearing through my kindle library. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime Kindle Unlimited. This is light weight and easy on the eyes in sunshine or low light.
Dr.TE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I switched to a Kindle Whitepaper from another brand of ereader. I use it to borrow ebooks from our public library. The Kindle process to accomplish this is simple and easy compared to my other ereader. I am quite satisfied with my Kindle so far, it was easy to set and get running. I will never go back to the other ereader."
jeangoat,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Dumped by former Paperwhite in the toilette and couldn't revive it. So new waterproof Paperwhite to the rescue! It's doing a good job and is waterproof so it might save me if I goof again. It seems a little more sensitive to touch than the old one, but I'm getting use to it. I like the way you can set up your page's appearance."
Judith Elliott,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ten years ago, on my 70th birthday, my daughters presented me with the best present ever - a Kindle. I love my KINDLE!! For my 80th birthday coming up, they bought me a Kindle Paperwhite and I am enjoying this one as well. I love being able to have a book at my fingertips within minutes. In fact, there isn't anything negative to say about a Kindle. It is one of the best inventions of this generation. Judith Elliott"
Sherry,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the size, weight, and light. I also like being able to change the font size. I did have to call customer service twice to get my digital orders sent to my new Kindle and not to my old one. First rep insisted that I had not registered the Paperwhite, but I certainly had done that. It took a second call and a new rep to get it fixed. And the battery life is very good!!! I have recommended it to my friend who only reads on her phone."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s a great portable, lightweight reader which works equally well in bright sunlight or a dark bedroom. I only wish I could download Overdrive to it so I could borrow books from the library without using a secondary device such as my tablet. Otherwise, perfect."
Dora O,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Kindle Paperwhite! It's perfect in terms of size (portable enough to put it in my purse) and I can read in the dark, in a pool or tub, and it's easy to keep up with my library. I have trouble reading books due to getting headaches (probably age related) but I find that doesn't happen when I use the Paperwhite. I wish I wouldn't have waited so long to get one."
Carolyn Bandle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was using a much older Kindle and was excited to see them come out with a waterproof version! I often like reading by the pool or in the bathtub, so I feel much more relief using this than my older one OR an actual book. It is very lightweight, easy to transport, and the battery lasts a while. I got it last tuesday, probably spent at least 15 hours reading this week (finished 2 books), have spent at least an hour browsing the store, and have the backlight on 75% of the time - and yet I still have 30% battery. If you are in the market for a new kindle (or are just looking for an upgrade), I highly recommend this!

I also bought the waterproof case in yellow. I like the color a lot - it stands out and is a bit more summer-y."
Jaxie's M❤️M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love reading and the fact that my new Kindle has a built in light so there's no worrying about turning on , or leaving on a light to read when I am in bed all ready to read.
If I am honest I do miss somewhat the pages of a book...but carrying many, many books in one light weight and convenient book, helps make up for that.
This is my second Kindle my old Kindle is still running and works great it just was having a hard time charging.
I did however get many years of great reading from that Kindle.
I’m SURE my new Kindle will give me the same❣️"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,i love having all my books in one place. I will be very happy when the upgrade to sort books is installed. it is the reason I bought this model.
historybuff,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Screen should be bigger. It’s ok. But I guess I was spoiled. I did have a Kindle DX, which had a very big screen. The DX stopped working. Wish It still worked. The paper white will do. But I preferred a device with a little bigger screen."
Lynn Birmingham,2.0 out of 5 stars,Loved it until I didn't. Less than 3 months old and will not hold a charge. Get it fully charged and within 6 hours of not using it the battery is completely drained. Fooling around with this and nothing. Does this mean I need to buy another new one ? Not best pleased.
Beverly Brennan,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this version to replace my old one. It's as easy to use and looks almost the same. It's a bit thinner. I haven't tested it waterproofness yet and think I only will by accident . I haven't had it long enough to assess the battery life. I truly love paper white for night reading.
John McCabe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My previous Kindle was 9 years old when it stopped working. There is a learning curve to experience with this version, but so far it is promising. I especially like that all of my purchases are permanently stored so they can be downloaded to a new device."
Aj8&Mrs,1.0 out of 5 stars,Touch screen worked on and off. The worst was battery life. Just a day and charging was needed. Was supposed to get a few months kindle unlimited free but I keep getting charged. They’ve taken it back for tech support or something... Well see what happens.
C. A. C,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reading on the Kindle paperwhite is a joy. The battery life is excellent and the touch screen is very responsive . You have the best of both worlds with the built in light for night reading, and you can turn it off for reading in the sun without having the glare as with a regular tablet or phone."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very compact yet easy to read. Battery life is unbelievable Have just finished one very long book and battery still at 83%. I do not turn it off, just let it go to sleep when I close it up."
2lil2fail,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My early negative review was wrong. Opinion was based on the ""as issued config"". After going to airline an disabling blue tooth and wi-fi, setting back light to min required, using small type to minimize page changes battery life is acceptable. I now like it. Just turn on the acessories as needed. Now if I can just find my reading glasses"
Ruhtrho,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comparing the two, I absolutely love the Kindle paperwhite. The back lighting is so nice. Now I do not need a lamp on to read. I have also noticed that is a more compact unit that is a little lighter, weight wise. I would say the only thing that keeps this one from being perfect is the lack of page turn buttons on the side. I much prefer that to the touch screen page turning. Other than that, I love the battery life, weight and storage. All in all a great device."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just use mine to read books . I don't require to for anything else. My wife bought me the fancy one with color and all the bells and whistles with all that the battery life isn't the greatest so I went back to the plain kindle paper white, now I' very happy"
Tiffany Matthews,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the battery life. I have been reading at least an hour almost every night for a week and it still hasn’t died. I like the fact that it has a screensaver that looks like it’s on. I didn’t like the fact that the screen would have to reset after each page but I was able to go into settings and change that. It makes reading much smoother. I also have kept it in my purse with no concern of it getting broken. Can’t wait to try it out in the sun!
Joanne,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my first generation kindle was starting to act up. I was surprised how much nicer this was to adjust to
Just a note on the first generation which lasted almost 12 years u can not beat that for value then with trade in Amazon had 25 percent off the purchase off the new kindle"
Dale B,1.0 out of 5 stars,The micro USB charging cable won’t attach to the cahrging port. I have a collection of cables. Some fit/connect. Others don’t. I would return the Kindle but (1) I already ised my trade-in credit for my old kindle and (2) I donmt have the time to deal w/ returning it.
daniel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Liked: Back light makes it easy for reading in nearly every environment. The controls are intuitive and the screen has a great resolution making nice crisp text even when the font is very small.

Dislikes: When you have a large library (50+ books) it can be hard to manage and find what you want. It lets you group by 'collections' which is a start but I would find it much better if a collection could contain further collections. The battery life is pretty decent so far. I've only had it for about 2 weeks. With the back light set between 0-14 (it goes up to 25) I find it lasts 10-15 days on a single charge using it 2-3 hours per day."
TF,3.0 out of 5 stars,So I Received the Kindle paperwhite as a gift and use it daily. I absolutely love it minus one major flaw. I want to know who was the bonehead on the design team that thought it was a good idea to put the power button on the BOTTOM of the device. You cant prop the kindle up without it restarting or asking if you want the screen off. So for that and that alone I gave the kindle three stars.
Rylie Williams,3.0 out of 5 stars,broke my white paperwhite so I wanted to replace it but to my surprise the newest version was cheaper than the older white version. The updates to the system don't make a big enough difference to me so overall I still prefer the white version but for 40 dollars in savings I will stick with this newer one and buy a decal
musikman79,5.0 out of 5 stars,The battery life for this kindle is great. I may need to place it on the charger once a week. Just getting started with downloading my library.
Jules,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't like the way they changed the screen. I haven't figured out how to change it to my liking. I don't like the way they show pictures of the books instead of just listing them. Pictures are too small, can't read titles. When I add a book to a collection, it stays on screen instead of disappearing like the old Kindle. I really dislike that when I order a book, it doesn't pop up on the main screen, I have to hunt for it."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I purchased my new Kindle Paperwhite, I was hesitant because of all the mixed reviews. I had to do something though because the light of my old paperwhite quit working. So far, I have not regretted the purchase. I am having to get used to how it feels in my hands since it is slimmer. I also bought a waterproof case for it, but I don't like it for everyday use so I am going to buy a leather one as well. My only complaint is that I can't make the font bigger like I could on my old one. Other than that I am very happy with it."
Robert D McGrath Jr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife loves to read paperbacks and more. This product was a gift for her and she loves it. Along with Amazon Prime she has so many novels to read on demand. No more $14. Paperbacks to read and then store or giveaway. Lightweight, compact, easy to use, you can take it anywhere to read at will."
Pat McG,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My new Kindle holds a charge for about 4 days instead of the length they advertised. The touch screen is too sensitive and my thumb hits it and it can go back as many as 4 pages. I have to turn the Kindle off and back on (a timely process) everytime I want to buy a book. I called customer service and could not understand a word the foreign lady said. These were the exact problems I had with my nook and that is why I bought a Kindle (as I heard so may good things about it) At least the took would tell you you were on page ""183 of 453"" this book only tells you what page you are on. Over all I see no difference between the Nook and the Kindle."
Craig Philip Masi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So darn easy to pick up and read. Certainly cuts down on the clutter of books around the house. I've always liked the idea of holding books in my hands, especially hardbacks. I've finally succumbed to a Kindle!!"
CJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love this. I received it as a gift and I use it everyday. It’s perfect at night when I can’t sleep and I also use audible when I’m on the go. The fact that it is waterproof I can read while relaxing in the hot tub. Only complaint is the touchscreen but it’s not too cumbersome just can use some improvements.
Pseudonym,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best kindle so far, but the power button protrudes enough that I have accidentally powered it off when holding it with one hand."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the water proof feature, it's great for the pool and hot tub. My main complaint is the location of the power button on the bottom edge. I've repeatedly powered it off by mistake by propping it up to read, or even just by how I like to hold it with one hand. If the power was on top it would be perfect."
SusieFG,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the new Kindle. It's much faster than the previous Paperwhite Kindle. I haven't had it long enough to comment on the battery life but so far so good. The menu is a bit different from the previous one but it is just a matter of getting used to it.
Rich Gautier,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Likes: the screen light, the size and feel, the faster processing
Dislikes: Falling asleep reading and waking up 30 pages ahead...and the new Library screen...bring back hard page turn buttons please"
gabbygyrl,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I definitely miss the fact that my Touch was so much lighter, had substantial more battery life, not to mention it just felt more durable. Despite these characteristics, I still prefer the Paperwhite for the reason I upgraded - the light. Yes, ""I have seen the light,"" and It makes all the difference. Perhaps one day Amazon will improve the features mentioned above, which will then make the Paperwhite PERFECT."
Review reader & writer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this little Kindle because I can take it everywhere with me. It is small, light, easy to read from and holds a large number of books. I recommend for those who always like to have a book with them. Can read outdoors since the screen is non-glare."
Brit bee,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Waterproof which will work great on my beach vacation or reading in the barh. The Bluetooth for audible is nice, I don’t use it but for those who do it is a good feature. I like the no glare screen and the amount of books I can take with me and the long battery life."
Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Loading next page every 15-20 seconds? A constantly flickering screen makes reading difficult. Nothing to do with normal reading.
CB06,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only negative thing I have to say os where the power button is located along the bottom, I keep hitting it and making screensaver come on. But other than that, its eink, and it's Waterproof. I can take it to the pool this summer and not worry about one of those cumbersome waterproof bags. I couldn't be happier!!! The price too.... very happy!"
Sonnie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got for a friend for a combined Christmas and birthday present. She loves reading and book store prices can be a bit high. She had an amazon fire tablet but her son took it over. I love the paper white because it doesn’t catch kids eyes lol. She loved it
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love love LOVE my kindle paper white! I was nervous buying a kindle as I had never had one but after talking with a good friend I took the leap. I’ll never go back. The works well in sunlight and the battery lasts forever before needing a charge. My only complaint it every once in a while the touch screen lags
GaryInCSCO,3.0 out of 5 stars,"You can't directly download a book from a library using Overdrive or Libby.
You have to use a computer or tablet to down load a library book to your Amazon account and it then syncs to your Paperwhite via your wi-Fi connection.
Amazon seems to want to monitor all your book activities so they can target advertisements and book recommendations to you.

Coming from an Android tablet, I didn't find the Paperwhite interface particularly intuative. After stumbling around for several books, I can navigate satisfactorily now.

I do like the light weight, simplicity, and portability of the Paperwhite."
ltr,5.0 out of 5 stars,I traded in my old Kindle e-reader with keyboard for the new Kindle Paperwhite. I really like my new Paperwhite. It is very user friendly Battery life is sufficient for me. Reading is made easy with the bright surface when there is not enough light in a room.
Shannon Lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My new kindle is great! My last kindle didn’t have the backlight and my new one does. This is a great feature, especially for those of us that like to read in bed at night while our spouse is sleeping. The light is also adjustable so your eyes don’t tired. This is truly my favorite way to read!"
Cassandra,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently had a baby and it’s so nice to be able to read in the dark without disturbing my baby. I use the Libby app from my public library to read library books for free. It’s super easy to use and I like that it talks to my Goodreads to log what I’m reading. I would say it’s annoying to me that the charger is sold separate (you know we have to buy it amazon). Also, the cases seem expensive for what they are. All in all though I’m super happy with the purchase and I would say if your an avid reader then it’s totally worth the expense."
hayu,2.0 out of 5 stars,I have never ever had a Kindle that stayed charged like it suppose to. Just bought one in two hours it went from 100% too 97% and same old same old. Called tech they said it only lasts a week if you only read it one hour a day. Give me a break and come up with a better lie then that would you.
Classicalmusiclover,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Flashing screen when changing pages is annoying but I found that larger font, which helps me, minimizes flashing. Also swiping to change pages helps to control flashing.
My initial reaction was to return the Reader, but I’m holding on to it for now."
Amer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I take this with me everywhere now. It was easy to figure out how to borrow books via my local library’s Overdrive account. You’ll need your Amazon login and library card number/login to Overdrive on your desktop computer to check out books.

I don’t like seeing ads on homescreen and it has a flickering quality when you touch the screen. Sometimes seems somewhat slow when you touch screen."
NANMON,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I may be a little biased since I upgraded from a much older model, but there is literally nothing I have foung to dislike about this new model. Waterproof, great backlight and battery strength, easy to use and audible built in, this Kindle is a beast. The optional cloth cover is very nice as well, and the entire thing fits the hand neatly. It was everything I wanted in an e-reader."
joselo,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got 2 Kindles for my kids and they love it. It's also very convenient to just download books in their kindles from our local library.
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I stopped myself from buying one of these forever because I liked the feel of actual books but one night, after deciding not to read because I didn’t want to have the overhead light on, I decided to give it a shot. Now I’m averaging a book every three days and show no signs of stopping. It took awhile to figure out how to get books from the library and I’d like to have an option of seeing Page x of y while I’m reading so I know how far I’ve got to go, but I can survive that last bit. I’ve charged it maybe three times in the last three weeks and I read for a couple hours each night. Turns out I should have taken the plunge a long time ago."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,I find it difficult to navigate through the text. It has many good features but lacks user friendly basics.
Mitchell Martin,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Works OK, but is very VERY laggy until you perform the first update, then it is only a little laggy, still would prefer a real book over this, I only got this because the kindle versions of a lot of the books I have to buy for class are cheaper or free on this."
Tom,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sometimes I get one extra page, sometimes six or eight. I spend all my time trying to find my location, and not reading the material. I got this as a replacement to the one I had previously. I got rid of that one after several years because it started having a problem holding a charge. Getting the new one was definitely a mistake."
jtmilw,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am mostly pleased with this Kindle. The size and built in backlight are appreciated differences from my previous Kindle. The touchscreen is fine, except its sensitivity sometimes send it flying forward and it's difficult to back up to the appropriate page. I might be doing something wrong, but I can't figure out what. I'm overall very pleased."
David C. Reimold,4.0 out of 5 stars,I replaced my original paperwhite after 7 years. The battery was weak and I was having problems downloading. The new one has a clearer screen and slightly faster response. The battery life is very good. I have had some problems with the unit freezing which requires a restart. This is the reason for 4 stars. I have always liked the readability of the paperwhite.
Alex,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my paperwhite, it's so light and easy to use. The product when it works is excellent for reading inside and outside. BUT it had a 12 month warranty and died after 14 months. No extreme use or other reasons why it shouldn't have lasted forever. Maybe I just got a bad one, but in that case I think Amazon should have replaced it rather than offer me a discount to buy a new one."
rhonda mellons,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am loving my Paperwhite. It isn't completely glare proof; however, all you do is tilt it one way or the other! Great for sun and reading at the beach or pool. Taking mine on my cruise in May! Can't wait. It hold TONS of books. I don't care for the ads, but they're not that obtrusive."
CA Bookworm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have arthritis in my hands and fingers making it hard to hold books and my old Kindle Fire so this little guy is just perfect for me. His small size makes it easy to slip into my purse and I love the patterned cover, makes the little guy easy to find."
Jules R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE this Kindle! I was recently in the Bahamas and saw several people around the pool reading on their Kindles. As soon as I got home, I ordered this Kindle. LOVE the size!!! It is so easy to use and I love reading on it! I used to carry my iPad around to read on but this is so much easier. I highly recommend it!!!"
Amers,3.0 out of 5 stars,This is my first E-reader and I am underwhelmed. The touch screen is unreliable when reading a book and trying to turn back to a previous page or pages...frustrating! The micro charger is inconvenient. The type is easy to read and the lighting is better on my eyes. Love how lightweight it is!
Jasmine Glasheen,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is the worst Kindle I’ve ever owned and usually I buy them for $35 when they’re on sale. It’s always on and advertisements are always on your home screen... there’s no shutting them down. Buying a book? Good luck getting it downloaded the same night. Want to watch movies or scroll the web on your paperwhite? It’s not built to do that. Also? Superslow. Takes longer to do things than any other model. Really just 💯 sucks.
David l,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately I lost my last Kindle . That was my 3rd one and I loved them all. I replaced my lost one with this new one Version(10) Kindle. It is just awful . I find it skips ahead for no reason, lacks some of the extras such as games and the size is too small. Iam constantly turning pages. I am very unbhappy with this version"
Grieg Vanlandingham,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just set up my Christmas gift, Kindle Paperwhite 10 Generation. Fully charged but shuts off after about 10 min of reading. Have to restart over & over. Did not come with a cable so used my older 2018 Paperwhite cable. Very disappointed! I have had 7 Kindles since my first one. This is the worst.
Great customer service! New Paperwhite is working, USB cable is on the way. Thank you, Rachel. Great technical support."
cyn ann,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th Kindle! My 3rd paper white. I have a kindle fire - not as enthused about it - just too many apps, eats up the battery, etc. Just prefer the paper white. Pretty much like other kindles I’ve had - let’s me read - and that’s what I want!"
Bill W.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an earlier kindle and I absolutely love it. I really wanted this new water resistant kindle for use at the beach and in the tub. Seemed like an easy win. There are some nice design features, like the display surface being even with the case bezel. Unfortunately there are two serious drawbacks. First, the display is blinding. This kindle is completely unacceptable for reading in bed, which is my number one use case. Second, the battery life is greatly diminished from my prior version. This is an annoyance, but not a deal breaker. I'm really disappointed; I had been so excited."
JB,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Big improvement over my first generation Paperwhite: more even lighting, more responsive, higher resolution. Battery life is fine, use airplane mode until you need to update or add books. Love the flat screen and new cover. Not great for books with a lot of illustrations. Got a fantastic deal for mine on Prime day."
Becky Gish,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Beware of Trade-In Program! Used their Trade-In program to purchase a new Kindle ereader. The devise I traded was sent in the original box and packed well. They dropped my trade value because they say the face was cracked. My Kindle was not cracked, it was in excellent condition except the battery would not hold a charge for very long anymore. If you use their Trade-In program make sure you take pictures or something of the condition. My opinion of Amazon and their Kindle has drastically changed!"
sheree451,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is great! The screen is level with the front, easy to operate and the light is the best! Love the function that allows you to switch the words and background from a light background with dark words to a dark background with light words, which works great for reading in bed at night. I was going to get the basic Kindle but the light on this one and the comfort level of reading the screen make it well worth the extra money."
DougMart,5.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life is nice but the backlight is nicer. Now I can read in a dark bedroom without disturbing spouse. I haven't felt the need to test the water resistant claim. But nice to know it's there. My Touch was full of books and I was deleting books to make room for new ones. This 8 Gig Paperwhite is half full now after transferring the documents from the earlier one.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Kindle Paperwhite is light and small, making it easy to handle and carry in a pocket. I also bought the non leather cover to give the device some protection. The screen is easy on the eyes no matter what the background lighting. I have found that the battery for me doesn't last the weeks as advertised, but I also read a lot. The only other complaint I have is the power button is on the bottom edge of the device. When I am reading long hours in a chair. I rest the device on my thigh and have on several occasions inadvertently powered it down. A window comes up asking if you really want to shut down, so you can stop the process. It only seems to happen in the good parts of the story."
moondsb,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got this as a gift for someone's birthday who loves to read and she travels alot ... now she doesnt have to carry her books ... she loved it when she can download any books she wants to read.
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Touch screen is really bad. There's a 1 second delay on every press. The UI is horrendous.
This is like a tablet works like an early 2000s touch screen kiosk. Also it shows ads when you lock the screen. It legit shows an ads for other books, I didn't pay money just to get an advertisement filled tablet. I don't recommend to any one.
Edit: turn out you can pay to remove ads, but it's listed as Special Offering, misleading language."
Alicia J,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband got this for me for Christmas. And I love it!!! It’s extremely convenient. Small and lite. It travels well and fits perfectly in my smallest purse. At night, I keep it on my night-stand so if I can’t sleep, I just open it up and start reading without disturbing my husband. Highly recommend."
PGL,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Kindle Keyboard for a number of years, and it quit working and could not be fixed. I decided on the Kindle paperwhite. It was easy to adjust to the differences in operating the two Kindles. I like the built-in light, and that I can read on it outdoors in the sunlight. I do not think the battery lasts as long on the Paperwhite as it did on the Keyboard, but it still has a long enough battery life for me."
Jennifer Zamboni,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great size! (probably pocket-sized, if you're a fella). Nice and lite. The reading experience is smooth, the backlight works great, fairly easy to navigate. I haven't tested the idea of being waterproof, but I’m getting the impression from the instructions that it it's actually water resistant. All in all, I’m a happy little book dragon!"
PeeWee,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for my daughter who is an avid reader. She loves the device for reading but was disappointed that Amazon does not allow her to read books from our library app "" cloud library"". This device only allows borrowing from ""Overdrive"". Which is not a program our library offers and from what I am reading from other users has limited books. I would not have purchased this device if I had known. Hopefully Amazon will stop being so proprietary and allow this device other options. The Kindle Fire devices are allowed the other options."
Melinda Bennett,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have the very first kindle paper white... been over 8 years and the battery is not holding its charge so decided to get the new one... it seems to me to be the same... great for reading outside...read some reviews that is was different but I don’t see it... I love the paper white and have recommended to several friend who also love it!
jana hoyle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an avid reader so I burn through Kindles. Oddly enough my first one still works but is not back lit. I love my new kindle. Very light weight but it does not seem to be holding a charge as long as the others. I am a little surprised by this but again, I am not your average reader so it is probably my reading style."
Susy & Alex,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am in love with this product! This is the first time I actually read books electronically. I tend to be old fashion and go for books, but decided to give this a try. It feels as if you're reading an actual book with the exception that it is way lighter and with a soft touch the page turns lol. Highly recommend if you are a book lover and tend to carry books around like me!"
Kelly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a kindle fire but I’ve never really enjoyed it. As a tablet it was horrible so I wanted to go back to a device that was just an e-reader. My new kindle is a good comfortable size; it actually fits in a small cross body purse yet it’s big enough to read without any issues. I can read outdoors without any glare. So far, the battery life seems great. I’m am happy to just have an e-reader again."
Born to Ride,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Paperwhite is great except for placement of power button. When holding Paperwhite my little finger which I use to hold up goes right to the power button which will inadvertently power down the Paperwhite. Very annoying. Amazon should have placed power button on top of unit not the bottom. Also, can not move screen 180 degrees (only will do landscape) which if it had this capability would address the power button issue. I got a cover to address this issue."
SunKissed,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved my previous generation Paperwhite but some days wasn’t taking charge so got this new one. I miss the feel of a book in my hand but these are great when on vaca, in the pool, doc office, waiting and can read a few pages. You can adjust the font for easy reading. Plus no books to pack, try to give away etc when you move. They are all in your bag."
JBC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really love this kindle....but....no instructions of any type are included....
So between guessing and asking questions on Google I have figured most things out...
Simple instructions should be included...like how to get back to the home screen...where to find all of your books...etc..."
Jim Gottstein,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I own one of the early Kindles which I liked well enough, except that when I used the external light in the cover, it ran down the battery quite quickly. I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite to be able to read in the dark without depleting the battery so quickly. That feature works fine, but trying to pull up footnotes is a nightmare and I often give up. Also, imbedded graphics are even harder to see than in my original Kindle, which at least would display them full screen if you selected it."
J. Parks,5.0 out of 5 stars,Display quality very good. Text easy to read and easy to change text size. Found that the experimental browser works well and is a lot faster than my old Kindle. Although when displaying pictures the resolution is not optimal. I prefer to display pictures on my Galaxy Tab 4. All in all the new Kindle Paper White is well worth the upgrade.
Bamboo,3.0 out of 5 stars,Love the ease of use & hope never need water resistance feature. Pages turn slower than previous model & takes longer to wake up. Not by much- but I noticed. Also hate that I have to have a hard shell for it. Just want it to turn off & it won't do it w/out the cover. Very light weight & great size.
Kurt Gary,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This replaces my 4 year old Paperwhite. I got this one without special offers- no more adds on the screen- and it's working well. I've heard some complaints about the Touch screen- too sensitive- but it's working well for me. Battery life is fine, but I can't say it's that much better than my old one."
TC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really love this upgraded kindle from my old one. The life of the battery alone makes me very happy. Same size as my old one and also purchased a case to protect my beloved kindle! Everything transferred over from my old one with no problems. Thank you!
Monimi,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like it, but it has locked up and had to reboot many times in just the month or so I had it. Also, the battery wasn’t lasting as long as my previous kindles. Meanwhile, I dropped my caseless kindle from the coffee table onto the floor and now have an error repair message. Amazon costumer service chat line was super easy and helpful though and now I have to send it for repair. I’ll buy a new case since the 10th gen doesn’t fit older accessories and if I’d had it in a case in the first place it probably wouldn’t have needed to be repaired now. Dang it."
debbiedoll,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed with the battery life of this paperwhite. My previous paperwhite, which I gave to my Mother, lasted at least a day if not longer (and I was reading up to 4 hours per day if not longer). This unit, even in airplane mode, battery is depleted in hours. Even if I'm not using/reading anything, it just runs down. I'm having to charge it at least twice a day! Lets not talk about when it's connected to WIFI! Extremely inconvenient and disappointing. This feels like an upgrade DOWN!"
petunia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like it very much. Love the fact that it has a light so I can read in bed.
I like too that it can be connected to WiFi and I don't have to run
to my computer all the time. Glad I bought it."
renae pomycala,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I retired from teaching 5 years ago, and my daughters bought me a Kindle Paperwhite as a retirement gift. I used it EVERY DAY for the last 5 years, and for Christmas I got a NEW waterproof version. I can not be happier! The light is perfect for reading in the bright sun on the beach as well as snuggled next to my husband in bed without bothering him trying to sleep.

I will be a Kindle Paperwhite gal for life!"
Josslyn Christmas,5.0 out of 5 stars,I always like the kindle E-reader. This is 4th one if you count the one the came on my Amazon Table. This one is small and thinner than the other ones. I love that I can just put in my purse and have a lot books with me. I am avid reader and do not like to sit long periods of time waiting with something to read. Wonderful product.
Daniel Marshall,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon always sets the standard for e-readers and they do it time and time again. This one is affordable (compared to the Kindle Oasis or something like the Barnes & Noble Nook at a $199 price point) but it is also a superior e-reader. Works like a charm, feels good in the hands, can't beat it."
bookish me,5.0 out of 5 stars,"3rd Kindle. I treat my Kindles like a favorite sweater.....keeping them until they have no warmth (or battery) left. Love the new Paperwhite. Lightweight, longer lasting battery, and great light to make reading in bed enjoyable. Haven’t tested out the waterproof part, since I usually don’t read while swimming. I’m sure I’ll repost after the 1st water bottle spillage."
Carly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm on my third upgrade, keyboard to Kindle Touch to Paperwhite. This is the one I've been waiting for all along. The backlight is a game changer and doesn't irritate my eyes before bed.

It's lightweight and feels highly accessible from a motor skill and grip standpoint.

Battery doesn't seem like that big of an upgrade but it is quality as per usual."
MLF,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am going to exchange this for another as there is an area where the pixels are not clear. Also, this new paperwhite is a bit slow to ""wake up,"" which I read about before I purchased it. I just hope the exchange brings a clearer reading experience."
Video-Don,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the size and feel of this unit. Although I don't intend taking the unit underwater, it's great knowing that it is waterproof if I decide to be reading poolside. I get a variety of books, and I appreciate the extra storage space in this unit."
Avid Reader,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this before without seeing it and was so surprised as to how small it is...I should have researched more but I am now used to the size and it is perfectly fine. The main thing I dislike is how slow the note pad is when you highlight and want to add notes. When you are used to the speed and ease of using touch screen pads on phone and tablets, this keyboard sets you back to the early 2000's and can get frustrating. But for reading it is great! Another paid point is the the power button is on the bottom and you can easily press it by mistake which is annoying. I have had it a week and use it everyday and it is growing on me."
Hoddin King,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a thoughtful Christmas gift from my wife. I especially appreciate the light weight, the clarity of the screen, and the extra memory. I had to work with the settings a little bit to get them adjusted to my preferences. The ability to adjust the page settings in order to make the font bolder and to display the page number and the time, are a godsend. I personally found the ""ads and special offers"" very intrusive so I paid the extra $20.00 to have them removed. The water resistance should make it ideal to take to the beach!"
Jessie87,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this Kindle! It is basically the same as my previous one except the screen and frame are all one piece. When I went to turn a page last night, there were a couple times that I tapped it and it wouldn’t turn. I’m hoping to was just me and that’s not going to happen again. I really like it!"
Paulie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Kindle so I’m not really sure how to compare it. I love the kindle because it just lets me read, no notifications no alerts, nothing. It’s awesome. It’s a little glitchy here and there but for the overallness of what I want it to do and what it does - it works very well.

I do kind of wish I can read and listen to the audio at the same time, but My work around is using my phones audible app while reading. Just an extra step but 1 that I’m sure would make most happier.

Outside of that does the job well"
meredith smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,A love this kindle because it’s light to carry in my purse and not heavy like my 10” kindle I read when I’m at home. My only complaint is that it’s hard to find my books when it shows 88 pages of books so i have to make sure when I start a book on my big kindle that I locate it before I leave home.
Mary k.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It was a huge disappointment and I am sending it back. It is too small and there's not enough things to do on it and I just absolutely hated it. I got my other kindle fire working and it is so much better than this other thing,"
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars, Received as a Christmas gift and it has begun changing the font size and going back to the beginning of the book all by itself. What is wrong with this thing?
Jackie T Ewing,5.0 out of 5 stars,I read a lot. This Kindle is so compact but holds so much. Kindle Unlimited gives me so many different books to try - love it! Found the font size that works for me. Bought a case for it so it seems like a book. Will be able to fit this in any purse and take it with me everywhere.
mrzzp,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Battery drains too fast. Even when the device is completely off, it still drains. Customer service is very unhelpful. Promised will email the return label and never did, maybe waiting for the return date to lapse? You would think that buying a new device you wouldn’t get a defective one. Had to put one star or else wouldn’t go through but I definitely give it 0 star."
hoosiermama1009,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my Kindle but the display is a little weird. When you tap the screen to change pages, it flashes the negative of your settings before settling on your page. So, if you have it set for black page/white letters, it will flash white page/black letters first. It's annoying. The screen in more grayscale than black and white. It doesn't affect my reading but I do miss colored pictures in the ""books"". Next time I need a reader, I'm probably going back to a regular tablet."
Dianna,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there is some glare when under fluorescent lights that my previous Kindle Paperwhite didn't have & the black edges always show finger smudges. Other than that, I absolutely love it! The battery life is great,"
DiL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Recently upgraded from an old Kindle Touch model. I really love how lightweight the latest Paperwhite is and that it has its own back light. The one thing I miss is the dedicated home button and I like the old menu interface more than the new one.
panda951,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this E-reader. It is very lightweight and a good size to hold on to comfortably. I enjoy using it to read while floating in the pool so the waterproof feature is nice (it only gets a few wet spots, I have not completely dunked it into water). Very happy with my kindle!"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So overall happy with my kindle but I do remember the description saying the battery life was better on this unit, not true. Actually the battery life on my old unit was better than this one, I'm always having to charge this one, I'm glad I have a portable charger cause I use it daily on this unit. Other than that I love it."
Desiree,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love my paper white I got as a Christmas gift. I was using the kindle app on my phone but was having a hard time with outside reading and how small the book was. I take my kindle everywhere and it's perfect in any lighting. The only thing that I would change is the response to touch in the book store. Its lags just a bit (though turning pages in a book works perfectly)
MarciaJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always used kindle fire for reading, but thought I’d try kindle paperwhite & I’m glad I did. At first I hesitated due to it not being in color, but that hasn’t really bothered me. What makes kindle paperwhite great is it’s long battery life, lightweight & small size, & being able to read outside.
I love it!"
T Stricker,5.0 out of 5 stars,I loved my previous generation Kindle but after wearing out the arm on my second external light I really appreciate the integral back lighting. Controls are pretty intuitive but like with any touch screen device I often find myself several pages away from where I started if I'm not careful picking it up.
S. C. Ladd,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a replacement for my first gen Paperwhite. I like the size, the weight, The readability and that in this model I don’t have to key a password into it each time I want to read."
Hewhay,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: the size is great, the weight is comfortable and very portable.

Cons: touch screen is laggy, battery life is not weeks. Maybe it lasts weeks if you don’t read it. My battery drops about 10% per hour or hour and a half. I believe I had one of the first kindles about 10 years ago and the battery life was great. This seems like a giant step backwards in the battery department"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the fact that it is water resistant and can be easily viewed in bright sunlight. I have been using my iPhone and iPad for reading, but when I go to the beach or on a cruise ship those are not the best option. I like the Paperwhite for those situations. The touchscreen takes a bit of getting used to and it seems slower than what I am used to, but I have adjusted. Well worth the purchase."
Candace Hall,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really enjoy the Paperwhite because it is so easy to read using the format tools. The setup structure was so easy to understand and follow to begin. Only took me, maybe at most half an hour to begin reading a book. The back-light is fantastic rather than using a lamp to see in the evening to read. I really enjoy it so much."
DLS,5.0 out of 5 stars,I just purchased the new Kindle Paperwhite. This is my second paperwhite. The first is being used by my 95 year old mother who has vision problems. The new one is for me to use. It is smaller than the first one and readily fits in a purse. I also have only charged it once. It will be great for our camping trips this summer! DLS
Rlmgolfer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Same old terrific Kindle qualities with lighter device, better lighting and a flat reading surface. Haven't had the occasion to test the waterproof capabilities yet. Definitely glad I ordered the 2018 Paperwhite version. I also have the Oasis but now prefer to use the new Paperwhite more often. I do wish it had page turning buttons, however."
Susan Hintz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second paper white and I love how its noticeably lighter. As I take it everywhere in my purse, beach bag, etc, so far it’s perfect for my lifestyle."
AGonzalez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this ebook reader. I only wish the home page navigation pages were presented in color (the reader is monochromatic), other than that capricious non-essential wish, all else is great. Lightweight, compact and very comfortable to navigate. Definitely recommend."
Loves dogs,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this Kindle for myself and looked forward to using it. From the minute it arrived my husband claimed ownership and has enjoyed it ever since. He has already read countless books and is looking forward to starting other best sellers. My plans are to reorder another one this week!
Amy Alexander,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Kindle. My Kindle fire died last June and my original Kindle bought in 2010 died last month. I reached out to Amazon and they were NO HELP AT ALL. Amazon didn't even tell me they would pay to ship my Kindles back to them & give me $5 for each AND a coupon off toward my next Kindle purchase. The Amazon representative really let me down so I want to be sure everyone knows about it. My new Kindle Paperwhite is my best Kindle yet. I love built in light that I control depending on if I'm reading in the outdoors or my den. I love the battery life - my 2010 Kindle was always giving me the screen saying ""critical battery""."
PaulaRaye,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My old kindle had been dropped several times and after about 5 years of faithful service, simply bit the dust. I love my new one for the same reasons I loved my old one. I have wet AMD and am losing my eyesight so the ability to adjust the print size is a blessing. I am the type of person who panics if I don't have a book to read!"
C. Anderson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to replace my 8 yr old paper white. This newer model is a great reading experience, However, I was very disappointed to discover i had to give up the active content feature, which i used a lot during reading breaks. I want my old reader back..."
geri,5.0 out of 5 stars,This kindle is perfect for taking with you when you have to wait somewhere. About 2 days after I got this my old kindle gave up the ghost so I was glad to have this. I love the flat screen so there is no edge to bump into when you are scrolling or turning the page. I love that I can see the screen in any lighting!
Marshall,2.0 out of 5 stars,This device works but it just falls short because it uses super old micro usb. It is the only device I have that is micro usb. Also the screen is just a little smaller than I would like. But other than those major items it is a solid lightweight reading device.
mec526,5.0 out of 5 stars,So happy I purchase this it is now so much easier to read than using my old Kindle much lighter and easier to hold at night. I like the idea I can make the letters as big as I want them. I got this at a great deal and so pleased with my purchase.
Paul Wyszkowski,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle's main virtue is that it is a portable library, browseable and easily readable any time anywhere. Just don't forget to keep it charged. Also, flipping pages to find and re-read previously read sections is an exercise in advanced digital info manipulation. That aside, the Paperwhite is a killer invention, indispensable for any serious reader. The tenth generation is especially easy on the eyes with its clear, evenly backlit, high contrast, high resolution screen."
jeese,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would like to have the on/off button on top, I keep turning it off accidently. The battery doesn't last as long as I thought it would. I have been using a tablet to read books on. Quite a bit of difference. Guess I just need to get used to it."
Deb,3.0 out of 5 stars,"During set-up (including 2 calls with customer service), my collections wouldn't download, which would have meant that I would have had to rebuild collections for 1700 books. Also some of my active content was no longer supported on the newer version Kindle. I also didn't like the limited font sizes and styles and I don't need the waterproof feature. My old kindle still works, so it remains my choice."
Ladyfair524,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to ""trade in"" my old Kindle for a newer version and though I don't plan to test whether or not it is waterproof, it's good to know that if the unexpected happens, it shouldn't be a problem. I haven't had it for very long, but so far it is performing as expected and I haven't had any problem with it."
Dalin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Currently, I own the 4th Gen of basic Kindle, 1st Gen of Kindle Paperwhite, and the 2nd Gen of Kindle Oasis. And now.. this device. I don't complain. I don't even have any complaints when it comes to the Paperwhite. Unlike my Oasis, this one comes in with lighter weight with a lot of identical features. So, if you're looking for an e-reader that has similar features to the Oasis but with limited budget, this one is for you. :D"
Patricia Gardner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Replaced my old first generation Kindle (that finally died) with the new Paperwhite and couldn't be happier!
V. Floyd,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We went to ireland for nine days, read a lot on way over and back and some while we were there. Only charged it one time and that was probably because I was afraid it would die on way home on the plane. Pretty impressive! I have had a Journey for several years and this touch screen is a little different, so I am still getting used to it, but I like it very much!"
Sara M.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a bad device. But the way the screen flashes sometimes between loading screens kindnof negates the benefits of the dark mode. It also doesn't keep my place between devices. So if I read half a book on the kindle app on my phone, I have to search for wherre I was on my kindle. The battery life is nice. The device is a good size and seems nice and sturdy. I was just kind of hoping for a device that woukd feel more accessible. Something I'd feel like taking everywhere, but most of the time I find I'd rather just use my phone."
Ethan R,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did have one incident where I was trying to close a window, but it was slow and my rapid touching of the button resulted in my pressing of a ""Purchase All"" button on a book series that happened to be underneath the window close button. Wanted the books anyways I suppose. Reading is great."
Kevin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very pleased with this new Kindle Paperwhite. There was nothing wrong with my 7-yr old Kindle, but my old eyes aren't able to see the screen very well except in bright light. The Paperwhite's backlit screen is awesome and I don't have any screen viewing issues now. The screen could be a bit more responsive as light touches don't always respond. The battery isn't quite as long-lasting as my old one, but the screen light is likely the cause of that and is something well-worth the trade-off. Overall, I love this Paperwhite."
Tile Guy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is a total rip off and nothing more than an advertising vehicle for Amazon to sell you more books. That would be ok if Amazon was giving this Kindle for free but not ok if you pay $99 for it, Constant ads and even a screen saver with books Amazon wants you to buy. Was given an older version of the Kindle 3-4 years ago that was larger and didn't have the constant ads/notices to buy books Amazon thought I would be interested in. I will be sending this one back."
K Ellis,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love books, good old paper books. The smell! the feel! the ambiance! I never thought I would adapt to a Kindle or any kind of E-reader. However, I love that I always have my book with me. The kindle is just the right size for my purse and way thinner than any book would ever be. I never have the chance to make it to the library anymore and I can now bring the library to me.

That said, I am not a fan of how bright it is at night. It still lights up the room pretty well even when I dim the light.

Overall I am satisfied with my purchase."
DJames,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The is my second kindle. I really enjoyed my first gen 1 kindle, when it was finally no longer supported and the battery died, I used the kindle app on my iPad. However the app experience isn’t the same and having my books on a tablet offered too many distractions. This is the best e-reader I’ve ever owned"
TatooedGrma,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this newest version of the Kindle paper white for 3 main reasons. I liked the fact the it was water proof, there was a smoother edge and the battery lasts weeks.
The battery absolutely does NOT last weeks. I took it on trip out of town charged it fully before I left on a Wednesday. I was gone 5 days and when I got home it was dead."
Susan E.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I resisted for years getting a Kindle because I like the tactile experience of holding a hardback book. Now that I have arthritis in my hands and can no longer hold heavy books, the Kindle has been a godsend. I love the light to illuminate the text and how easy it is to use. I don't know why I waited so long!"
Plamen,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Recieved on time. The device is nice and work properly. Came with no adapter and the support told me it doesn’t come with one! So, it’s my mistake I didn’t read the description, but it’s still non sence to recieve a device with no charging adapter!!! So I have to buy one for extra 20$! I recieved a cable, which is defective! From the support explained they will credit my account so I can buy another one. COMPLITELY UNACEPTABLE for that money! And it was a gift, so the Christmas magic didn’t work!"
Linda N.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought I'd like this kind of device, but I was wrong - it's so convenient, so compact and I'm enjoying reading again. I can read in the car in the dark, in bed without a light on .....you don't have to find a lamp - this screen is nice, so easy to see to read. I'm amazed. My son got this for me for my birthday and I'm loving it!"
Brian F,1.0 out of 5 stars,My Paperwhite lasted one year and failed completely 2 weeks after the one year warranty ended. I was offered 15% off a Fire device as a consolation. Of course I refused that. If you go online and search for ”Paperwhite not charging no light” you will see these devices have an error where the battery won’t charge if you let the battery run down all the way. I suspect a class-action lawsuit will be the only way Amazon will be forced to fix this. I have an original Kindle first gen that is still going strong 10 years later. Save your money. Don’t buy this piece of junk.
Schmow,5.0 out of 5 stars,My first time owning 1 so I don’t know what to expect. Love it! Picked the 32 gb and got it at a discounted price. I haven’t been doing a lot of reading so I still have 53% battery after a week. I bought a case with it so no issues with fingerprints since I barely touch the screen. It works well with my airpods. No issues on the screen so far.
Clayton Pigwillow,3.0 out of 5 stars,"does everything I want, but it helps Amazon spy on me. I don't like being monitored all the time."
Anjie K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After basically using my last Kindle to death (The Kindle is dead, long live the Kindle), I was given a new one for Christmas. I was a little fearful of new menus or something, but it's very easy to figure out, and I love it as much as my old one."
Double Trouble,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the best E Reader ever. Its small but easy to read. I love the fact I can listen to books as well. I had 2 older Kindles but this is by far the best. THANK YOU!
J. Hay,4.0 out of 5 stars,The battery life on this is amazing. My kids gave it to me for Christmas and it still has about 65% charge. I've read several books. The only small knit pick I have is probably personal to me. I wish it was slightly less wide and a tad taller.
Jamie D,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my reader! I can sit in the direct sunlight and see perfectly. The battery life lasts a long time. My eyes don't feel strained when I'm reading for hours. Highly recommend.
anne barrett,5.0 out of 5 stars,I still need to figure out the audio part...have new blue tooth ear phones..but the pairing has been a bit of a challenge. I just need a little more time to figure out. But like the size and weight of the new Kindle. I had an older version but wanted the upgrade - definitely worth it!
Vanessa J,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I also have a kobo, and both have things I like and dislike. I love the ease in which you can borrow library books on kindle. However, the battery life on the kobo is much better. I find that I can go months before the kobo is down to 50%. On the other hand kindle reaches 50% every few days. Also, kobo gives reading stats, which kindle does not. (If there is the same feature on kindle, pls let me know where it is.) Kobo does not have “special offers”, which can be a distraction, and personally I don’t want to pay to have them removed. The dictionary on kindle is much better. Unlike kobo, I can listen to audio books, which is a great advantage. All the other features are comparable. I gave it 3 stars due to its low battery life, lack of reading stats, and ads."
M Broussard,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my fifth Kindle product. I just traded in the Paper White without the front light. I am so happy I did. I also bought the next advanced version with additional memory and better resolution. I highly recommend this edition of the Kindle.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Husband bought this for me for Christmas. Once I figured out how to use it, have read a few books. I like it once the screen offered me a way to enlarge the print and make it darker. I have so far read two books and am on the third one. I still don't know all the ways to work it, but will sooner or later figure it out."
Cyrus Bazeghi,5.0 out of 5 stars,This latest generation is very slick. I like the edge to edge screen and slimmer design. Being water proof is great as I like to read in the pool without worrying about getting it wet. Having more storage and the ability to pair a bluetooth headset is cool. Now you can use the Kindle to play your Audible books as well.
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was about half the length of my former Kindle and I much preferred the turn-page buttons on the sides that was on my former Kindle. Possibly they don't offer the Kindle that I used to have, but if I had a choice, I would want the style of my previous Kindle."
El,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved the color tones they used, much easier on the eyes. Unfortunately the programming itself is clunky. I get much more ease and functionality from the kindle app on my phone. Rather disappointing. The whole reason for getting this was to get off of my phone when reading, but I find myself going back to my phone because it's easier to maneuver."
Hard Rock Girl,5.0 out of 5 stars,My boyfriend loves to sit in the dark. I couldn't read my old kindle without a booklight. This is great it is small it lights up. It isn't too bright that it annoys my darkness loving boyfriend. I can read my books while he sleeps and everyone is happy. Problem solved.
Cynthia Harris,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my second Paperwhite. I love it’s features and how lightweight it is. I read a lot. I read myself to sleep. I love that I can have the lighting so low that it does not disturb my sleep. I can carry the Paperwhite easily in my purse. Thanks to my husband who got me started using it! I love it and highly recommend it!
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,After 11 months this kindle has stopped working. Can’t figure out why. It’s fully charged but won’t turn on
Mike Welch,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Travel frequently. To me best way to carry multiple books. Plus now can take to the beach, pool, or hot tub with no worries. Would give five stars but I feel is overpriced. Especially with special offers added. Device plus cost of adding books adds up quickly."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my new kindle. My old kindle is over ten years old with a keyboard. It still works well but this new one caught my eye and I purchased it. It is more compact and it fits easily in my purse along with the touch screen it makes it easier to use. I’m on my second book in a month with my new kindle as I don’t need a light on to read it like my older one. I am very happy with my purchase.
Joe,1.0 out of 5 stars,Had higher expectations for it. Liked the flush screen. Display doesn’t seem as crisp as prior generation although could just be the one I got. Like the fact it’s water proof/resistant. Probably would not have upgraded had I tried it first.
Thomas E.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace my 10 year old nook which cost under $90

Pros, backlight and waterproof

Cons

I consider it a downgrade from my old nook. Ten years and $100 increase I'd expect a lot more from this device.
It's slower to respond, the screed refresh rate is about the same but feels slower ,and it constantly mistakes a swipe for a click. It has no SD slot and a premium price for 32 gb of flash memory worth about $3.50 .

The real insult was having to pay extra for no adds? as most of the stuff I read was written before the typewriter, I really don't need the hard sell."
Neo Doc,3.0 out of 5 stars,Number one I hate transferring all my unread books to the active part of my library-always miss some and it takes forever .. but that problem happens when you buy any new Kindle. What I don’t like about my new Kindle is that it spontaneously turns itself off randomly!!! Usually when it’s at 70% charge .. a real pain!!
Leaette Lally,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I replaced my old kindle with a paperwhite. Not happy at all with it. You can't download library books from it, so I have to go to my old kindle to download, which means if I plan on downloading I have to carry both kindles, kind of a pain. I can download from Amazon but not library I wish I had bought an ipad maybe more versatile"
Moi,3.0 out of 5 stars,"What I dislike is when the supplier has to question their customers because they are, apparently, insecure over the products they are selling with these constant reviews of the products I purchase.. If you need the continuous reinforcement, I have to doubt that the leadership knows what they are doing and whether I should ever buy anything from them again."
runcix,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I updated my kindle and was excited to see this new version would pair with Bluetooth speakers. Mine can not locate any (Sonos, Car, Phone). Furthermore the size has been changed so my old kindle cover won't fit. Disappointing, not an upgrade."
yahoo me,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all. I love the kindle. It is awesome to have so many books at your fingertips. The issue that I have with this model, is that it feels small. I know that it isn't, but it just feels so. The display is great. Why the 3 stars then? I gave this 3 stars due to the less then rugged feel. It is like holding a frisbee. It is slippery and shows every bit of finger smudges. I am a long time Amazon supporter and it pains me to say that Amazon can and should do better."
MSM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have several including a more expensive one but I really like this one. I like that it is water resistant and the tablet reads so much more like a real book, there is no eye strain, its very easy to see. Excellent choice if your looking for an E-reader"
Becky,1.0 out of 5 stars,"how is it that when you buy any type of appliance or electronic device you get a power cord, but I just learned that the kindle paper white that I just received does not come with it I have to buy it separately?? Usually I am very happy with the items I purchase, but to have to buy a power cord separately is crazy. Guess I will be returning it since I cannot use it without the POWER CORD. SMH"
lockedout,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Also, still on my first charge, so I'll get back when I finally have to recharge. I'm fussy re my screens, but this one is great. Very easy and fast to turn pages. Haven't tried the dictionary yet ... or other features, but I am impressed so far!"
lisa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been stalling buying a Kindle because I like holding a book and turning pages to go back and forth if needed. I broke down only because of a vacation I'm taking and figured it would be easier. I've now learned you can ""borrow"" books on your Kindle thru public libraries! That is a win-win!"
George Morelos,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wife loves this new version of the kindle. She had her previous one for about 8 years and it’s finally wearing out. Bought this new one and she likes it even more than her old one. Easier to use and really likes the backlight. She says it’s easier to read as well.
Daniel Gutierrez,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great little e reader, been reading more than ever! Love how easy on the eyes it is whether in a dark room or out on a sunny day. Lots of cool features but this is were is starts to lose its greatness. Lags quite a bit, not very responsive to touch when trying to say leave a note and the biggest flaw is the complete lack of Bluetooth connectivity. There's a Bluetooth setting just for show as I haven't gotten any single Bluetooth device to work so don't get audible."
G. Coleman,2.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a GoodReader but when you turn it the light blares full force for about 10 seconds. This is a buzz kill. I read at night. This bright light blaring defeats the purpose of night time reading. I hope Amazon sends an update to minimize that bright light to make bedtime reading easier.
Alex,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first 3g kindle died and I needed a new one so I bought the paper white version. I love mine!! I don’t need a light anymore, the screen is so easy to read. If you are thinking of buying a kindle you will love this one. Plus it is water proof."
Benjamin Soderlund,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enjoying it so far. Took a little to get use to as it doesn't work like a regular touch screen. Has a slight delay due to how it works. But it's excellent so far. Great battery life and easy on the eyes for reading. Can even read PDF files with ease
Digital Dreamer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Kindle fan ever since the first Kindle came out. While I don't get every version that comes out this one got my attention. It has more storage space, Bluetooth capabilities and the fact that it's waterproof made me want this. So far, I'm loving this version and I'm glad I waited to see what they would come out with."
Abby Rosenstein,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Paperwhite is light weight, comfortable and easy to use. I love that I can read it outside in daylight without any annoying reflections. I don't like that it was hard for me to find my library of installed books and that the system is constantly trying to get me to buy new books."
Donald Westerhaus,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm staring at the second new Kindle Paperwhite in the last month. The first one was returned to Amazon with a litany of problems, and they sent me another free. The replacement, this one, has the same problems as the first. It resets itself in the middle of my reading a book, but it resets over and over again. Something is terribly wrong with both of them -- and I think it's the software. I'm going to try to send this one back also."
LAG_2004,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The description of the Kindle states that it’s compatible with Audible. It doesn't clarify that it’s *not* compatible with the immersive reading experience. The only reason I bought the Kindle was so that my daughter could use it to listen to the audiobook while watching the ebook highlight the text simultaneously (immersive reading), and stay focused on the tasks at hand vs. trying to read on a tablet that has apps/distractions. Immersive reading is not a feature of this device - it’s only available via the Kindle app. I’m disappointed with the Kindle and returning it."
Stella C,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this e-reader. It is perfect for reading at night, airplanes, or many other places. It is so much easier on my eyes. Regular tablets gave me a headache, but the back light on this is so gentle, I have no problems reading in the dark or light."
TC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the Paperwhite except for the fact that they took away the ability to have the clock stay on top so you know what time it is. Please bring it back. Having to minimize the page to view the clock is an extra step that is just so unnecessary.
AEK,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my 3rd kindle. I like the Kindle white . It is smaller than the fire an easy to carry in by purse. With the built in light I don't have to have another lamp lit. No glare is helpful if reading outside. Have not had it long enough to judge the battery life
ruthie,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Kindle gave me a list of all my samples which was very easy to follow and pick what I wanted to read. This new one: I can't find anything. I called the Kindle department and they really couldn't help me.

I also don't understand why it never shuts down so the battery keeps draining all day and all night when I'm not using it. Not very happy all in all."
Brooke S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a kindle fire for years and have also used the Kindle App on my iPad. I finally got myself a Christmas gift and snagged the Paperwhite on sale. I love how I can easily read at night, pinch to change font size and how long the battery life is."
schmoette,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The settings are not user friendly, took awhile to find how to flip screen from dark script to white script. Accustomed to an older Kindle where the settings made more sense. The lighted screen and water resistance hits it out of the park though, already dropped in tub and just dried with towel and kept reading. Kept the page!"
Kimberly Kerwood,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my 2nd kindle and omg do I love it!!!! The fact that I can read in bed with no light on is worth the upgrade alone!!!
Amazon TDDonn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Prefer older usage properties, seem easier to access"
Archit Garg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The reading quality is great. UI is not as clean as expected but if you travel a lot, its a must have."
Dorothy L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm still learning the procedures but all in all, I LOVE IT! I'm 93 yrs old and am rather house-bound so my son's gift of the Kindle is one of the best gifts I've ever received! Because of vision problems, the Paperwhite is an especially wonderful feature and the font change. Currently I'm using Unlimited for free books and will probably sign up later for the monthly membership. I splurge occasionally and pay for a book too. I plan to get a case for the reader soon. I really like that you can ck the battery life whenever you want, also what place you are in while reading a book. Kudos to the geniuses who invented this fabulous product!!"
John Warner,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The small size hasn't compromised readability so my new Kindle is a perfect companion for those times of travel or waiting. I also appreciate that I can read into the ight without disturbing my wife. One limitation has been that the large size of my hands has made highlighting difficult at times but use of a stylus takes care of that. Over-all, very satisfied with my purchase."
Rebecca,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love this kindle the battery time has lasted a really long time I got it for Christmas and the battery is still going strong I only charged it to 60% and it’s on 50% and it’s January. The only thing I’m kind of bummed about is that it’s kind of laggy .. not sure if everyone’s does this but mine is I tried doing a reset on it and it improved it a little
shirley,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a Kindle for several years, one of the older ones with the keyboard. I loved it, and it was wearing out. I
received this new PaperWhite as a birthday gift, and it has taken some getting used to, but I really like it. Ease of handeling, its got a big fan in me."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love everything about this little guy so far. He's so small (about the height of my phone, but wider) and the light is so awesome. Love that he's waterproof so I can read while in the bathtub without worry 😍 I splurged on a cover as well by Amazon and it was WORTH it!"
NY/NJ Dude,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first paper white kindle and I’m very happy with it, lightweight, holds tons of books and most importantly, I can read easily outdoors and by/in the pool. No glare and no worries if it gets wet. The on/off button on the bottom is a slight (very slight) annoyance but otherwise, this is perfect."
Cynthia DiAmore,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received my new Kindle for Christmas, started using it in Jan. and now a few months later the battery will not hold a charge......NOT happy …* IMPORTANT UPDATE...I RECEIVED A CALL FROM AMAZON AS SOON AS I POSTED MY PROBLEM, THEY WERE WONDERFUL! THEY WALKED ME THROUGH THE FIX (WHICH TOOK 40 SECONDS) THEY CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY, MAKING SURE I WAS SATISFIED...MANY MANY THANK YOUS AMAZON"
Ronnie Rund,1.0 out of 5 stars,My Kindle Paperwhite has failed after I have had it for only 5 months!!! And of all times to not be able to use my Kindle - during Covid 19! What can I do about this? I can find no way to contact Amazon for a replacement.
Laurie D,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Impressive little thing! Does everything it says it will. Light weight, easy to bring anywhere!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE THE EASE OF USING THIS READER - REMEMBERS AND OPENS TO THE LAST PAGE READ, AND LOVE THE TOUCH EITHER SIDE TO ADVANCE OR GO BACK A PAGE - AND DOWNLOADS BOOKS IN SECONDS
I GAVE UP READING A LONG TIME AGO BEAUSE EVERY TIME I PUT A BOOK IN MY HAND I INSTANTLY FELL ASLEEP - THIS IS MY FIRST E-READER AND I HAVE ALREAY READ 6 BOOKS IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS - IT IS JUST A DIFFERENT READING EXPERIENCE - I LOVE IT - EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ONE!"
Chintan Gundarania,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not an avid reader I just enjoy reading books. Ordering book after a vigorous search for the best book to read is kind of tiring and not so motivating. I was a bit skeptic about buying this product if it can provide a good reading experience and if it would justify the price.
I am happy with this purchase because now I read more often than before and now I don't have to wait to read a book that I choose to read (just a click away).

I have also tested this kindle in a shower for waterproofing test. It works fine underwater (until it is completely submerged the touch sensitivity seize). I didn't yet encounter any issues.

Here above I have attached a few pictures showing how it looks in different environments."
tambra,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My eyes love it. Reading on the phone or PC or hd kindle...hurts my eyes and my head. Just got it... but so far it's great! I was worried. Because I bought a refurbished one... returned it. Was very glitchy... I usually don't complain about refurbished... but this one
I have now. Brand new. Seems like it's going to be great. Easy to hold. Easy to take along.."
C. Burns,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you can't use your Kindle in the dark, it's worthless. I'm so happy I traded up from the Kindle White to the Kindle Paperwhite. But sort of pissed that they changed the size so that I had to buy more covers for it. That was pretty shifty of Amazon."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kindle is one of the 2 easiest digital devices I have setup and used. Text is easy on the eyes (and my eyes are getting progressively worse). The type is more legible than most printed books for my eyes and the screen has no glare. Can read in in most any light conditions. The viewing screen of apx 3.5 by 4.75 inches is a little small so I have to turn the page quite often is a small dislike. And I haven't figured out what I'm doing wrong yet but occasionally when I turn the page it shoots me multiple pages ahead. That is a bigger problem and I will figure it out eventually.
Anonymous,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I swore I'd never buy one... I'm a die hard book lover. But this simulates reading a book so well that you forget it's a kindle. It's nothing like reading on a phone, tablet or computer. Easy on the eyes. Highly recommend for even the toughest critics. A total game changer!"
Bill Hopper,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this to download some of the classics that were difficult to read on my iPad. I'm using Gutenberg and reading some old out of copyright texts. Sounds a bit weird but I love it and I read until I get bored and then switch over to new book. This is great it works well.
Mornixuur,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new Kindle. I loved my old Kindle. It makes reading so much easier and I read faster for some reason. Love the backlight and yes, you can turn it off completely. The battery life is not great at all, which is why I have 4 stars. I even tried it without the backlight. I guess maybe I have a bad battery on mine."
dita,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The functionality of the kindle did not disappoint, however, the exterior laminated coat began to peel (minimally) on the bottom corners of the device. The product is advertised as water proof, with that said I am not sure whether the top layer- laminated coat, is integral to that feature. I am not aware whether this mishap occurs from normal everyday wear and tear. In any case, I would recommend purchasing a protective cover as a preventative course. The peeling began approximately 10 months post purchase- thankfully the kindle was still under warranty and Amazon was able to remedy the situation. Hope this helps!"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish I could give this device a minus five (-5) review. It is my 6th kindle. I paid $20 for no special offers. The default mode , the first screen (which is not changeable) that the device brings up is a grid view of my library. The lower 30% of this screen is a Amazon advertisement for me to buy Amazon books."
SParker,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Drop the price $35 before it's even unboxed..... not cool, Amazon, you can do better than tell me I can return it...."
Tiffany,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it so far ! I am a flight attendant and I love to read so it’s so much easier to have a kindle instead of carrying around multiple heavy books. The charge lasts what seems like an eternity . And I love that it’s waterproof because I leave to read while on the beach or by the pool.
RFV,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Kindle. I broke the first one by dropping it. It actually still works, but the screen has a small crack from a bad drop on concrete. I always have a few dozen books on it and there is never a memory capacity issue nor a problem with remembering where I left off."
Uncle,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I spent 2 hours on the phone with product support after receiving this item, as it would not let me decline Kindle Unlimited. After doing the same restart over again 4 times, they finally concluded that the item was defective."
David F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have really enjoyed this product. The battery life literally lasts weeks and charging does not take very long. The adjustable brightness makes it easy for me to read in bed without blinding myself or waking my wife. Would definitely recommend.
Sharon Wallace,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lighter weight! Longer battery. Don’t trade in your old kindle. Mine was in perfect condition and when it was received they said screen was cracked and took back 20.00 of the 25.00. My husbands was cracked before we sent it in so I understood the 5.00 credit.
Stephen Byers,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I already saw the battery go to almost 0% in 3 days with very little use. Subsequently, I turned on airplane mode and it still dropped very quickly with very little use. What gives??"
Rhondakay,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like how light it is. Holding with one hand is so easy. It's made reading fun again. And knowing I can read in a bubble bath is awesome!
Nancy L. Walker,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love the new feature of opening the cover and having the Kindle start up without having to turn it on or off. The ease of using the Kindle. Everything about the Kindle is wonderful.
Paul S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Have been using a Fire for a couple of years and found it pretty good, when I seen this I figured its lighter and smaller should be better, IT'S NOT , MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO USE. iT IS LIGHTER AND SMALLER THOUGH AND SHOULD GO FURTHER WHEN I THROW IT!!!!!"
Karen Moran,2.0 out of 5 stars,It is very small and light so it is hard to hold and read but you can't lay it down to read. It was easy to set up but hard to find answers to questions I had when getting started reading. I still haven't found my book list all I see is a list of books that I do not own. I want my old Kindle!!!!!!!
Barbara E Golding,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to get help from google translate because the info on the first page was in dutch. Could not even figure out how to get into the kindle. When we first turn it on there should be access to a language bank to allow the new user to figure how to set it up.
Appreciate the ability to read with reverse lighting, easier on my eyes."
Sondra,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Costumer service helped me reset the device so the page turn didn’t stutter.

Battery life also wasn’t bad. (And I read A LOT!)

It’s also not that heavy in my purse. Barely notice it."
thomas e. archer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like it, but it turns off frequently and I have to wait to it to thru the process of turning back on. Also, I like the reading process, amount of time left in book. I click on it and then before long it disappears and I have to go back and hit it again. Not really satisfied with it."
Monica,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE this kindle!! I had the old version that didn’t light up and only had one button... it stunk because you had to stop reading if it got dark ( camping/ reading before bed etc) This kindle is by far the best. It comes to the beach with me, kayaking, camping - everywhere. I love the adjustable lighting for day/ night and not worrying if it gets wet. I did fall asleep on it and the screen was wonky and the words were all messed up, but I shut it down and restarted it and it was fine afterwards."
AZ Reader,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is my third Kindle. It said the battery could last up to 8 weeks. The battery doesn’t even last 8 hours much less 8 weeks. I tried calling Amazon and I get foreigners that I can barely understand telling me to restart it. I have several times and the battery still won’t hold a charge. I have had this kindle less than a month!!!
jimal,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I think this takes time to use. The features are not readily apparent and take time to understand. I had the old Paperwhite
and it seems to work better. I also wish it had speakers like the old one. Just seems to lack ease of use and features."
JJMI,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought it for personal use and lots of reading material. I liked the special offer which I got after I made my trade-in with an older version. So far, so good and am hppy to have gotten it. Will probably wait a few more years and maybe upgrade."
Liz Wright,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s got a much more sensitive touch screen than my old kindle. I swear, just my finger hovering over the right edge will cause the page to advance, sometimes by multiple pages. Very frustrating!
My old one was losing battery power, so I do appreciate the battery life."
Kaiden's Mommy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I take this with me everywhere!
I hate carrying books with me because they can get heavy and the can get torn up or damaged being lugged around in my purse. Plus I love not having to worry about running out of things to read when on the go. Wi-Fi is everywhere now, so downloading a new book is quick and easy. Love my paperwhite."
Carl,5.0 out of 5 stars,The paperwhite screen makes it much easier to read for long periods of time than any regular screen Kindle app.
Bettie Wallace,5.0 out of 5 stars,The learning curve has been a little daunting. I do like the small size and the built in light. I do wish it was a little more intuitive. I know once I have it figured out I will really like it. I do like being able to download free books.
Susan W,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my 8 year old graphite Kindle (grey scale print and tabs on the side to turn the page). It served my faithfully, but this new Paperwhite is such a treat! The screen is very easy on the eyes and I love the back light for reading in dark situations. Touch screen is nice too and having it waterproof is an added bonus. Battery life seems great so far too which is important to me and why I like a reader vs. a fire or iPad. It is light weight and easy to hold."
camila,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The new Waterproof Kindle Paperwhite is lighter than the previous model and has the elegance of the former Kindle Voyage (the device that I was using previously). I had three Kindle devices so far: New Paperwhite (2013), Kindle Voyage (2017), and now the Waterproof Paperwhite. Comparing to my former devices, the Waterproof Paperwhite is lighter, faster, and the battery duration is quite good. I highly recommend this device."
Kris B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Upgraded from previous gen Paperwhite just because of the screen being flush with edges and for the glossy smooth finish. I hated the paper like textured screen on previous gen and raised edges annoyed me. The new version solves these issues and is easily the best Paperwhite ever made by Amazon.
Magic Mike,4.0 out of 5 stars,I find the Kindle to be an excellent device both in size and quality. I find that the background is not white enough and that reading on my IPad is easier. I like how it saves my place in the books I am reading. I am looking forward to listening to books on the Kindle.
happy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with a waterproof Paperwhite. It is smaller around the edges than my other Paperwhite. What I absolutely did not appreciate is being FORCED into purchasing the Amazon kindle $40 cover to get the th I wanted. Used to be you could select the gb. I find Amazon kindle covers to be too expensive and inferior to finite covers.
Joanna F,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The kindle BLINKS dark black every time you turn the page. I found it extremely distracting and will be returning this product immediately. Amazon, please fix this!"
lisatannler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my new paperwhite. My last one lasted years and still works but I like reading in bathtub and while laying at pool so decided to get this new waterproof one. I thought I would never give up books but there is nothing like having 100s of books at my fingertips. So far, I am very happy with my new kindle."
Linda Doggett,5.0 out of 5 stars,I read in bad and have been using the Kindle app on my iPad. The real Kindle is a featherweight compared to holding an iPad! It is taking a little time to get adjusted to the finger gestures but in time I will remember not to try iPad moves.
Stephen C. West-fisher,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My only complaint is the size - a little on the small size for me. My previous Kindle was/is one of the old large DXs. I really appreciate the back light, that is the main reason I decided to purchase even though my old one still functions perfectly."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I read; a lot. The size is smaller than what I had and it is easier to hold for long periods of time. It has a great battery life and I can read 3 books in a day and still have battery. Easy to read in bed/dark. No real eye strain except for when I read for hours. Pretty sure that isn't the Kindle's fault. Like the others easy to bump up the font when you have tired eyes but can't see anymore and simply can't leave the story unfinished.
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Many people buying e-readers are doing so because of vision problems. That means we are using Large Print settings. The small screen size and odd page turn detract from the flow a bit.

If you are using a regular font size, the size is a non-issue."
Shortie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OMG I love my little paperwhite. My little sidekick I call it. It's so tiny and lightweight. Kind of looks like a display of a screen but not too be moved. I love reading my books on it, I love to listen to my audiobooks on it. It's just perfect."
Alan Richardson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this to take on several road trips planned instead of toting around paperbacks. Really compact and really, easy to read screen. Nice selection of books through Amazon as well."
Mikey,3.0 out of 5 stars,We have 4 Kindles in our home. I love my Kindle. I got the new Kindle Paperwhite for my wife for Christmas. It took HOURS TO GET IT SETUP! I had problems getting it to communicate with our house WIFI/Bluetooth sys. Very frustrating. It's finally working fine and the wife really likes it a lot better than her old Kindle.
Dachsie Lady,4.0 out of 5 stars,The new Kindle is very light and the paper white is easy on the eyes. So far I am loving it. The jury is still out on the battery. It seems to me it is running down pretty fast. I only have this Kindle for a few weeks. Know more in about 6 months.
usmsdan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Kindle is truly a game-changer. Light weight, portable, readable in bright sunlight, non-glare, full featured, and practically inexhaustible... the battery is so vastly improved. This one is a quantum leap over my previous Gen II kindle.
Trust me."
April Cantu,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m loving it so far. Love the compact size. The screen responds a little slower than what I’m used to on my iPad or Samsung tablet or kindle fire tablets I have but I’ll get used to it. Love that I can read in bed with the backlight. I also got the leather amazon wake up case and it’s perfect. Highly recommended for reading lovers.
Tallon Canaris,5.0 out of 5 stars,First of all this is my first e reader and that being said this product is amazing! It’s lightweight and slim and very easy to hold. The screen is crystal clear without being straining on the eyes. I was a little concerned with some of the negative reviews but I haven’t noticed any downsides of this Kindle. I highly recommend this product!
Robynhasthree,5.0 out of 5 stars,I gave this to my mother as a Christmas gift. She's an avid book reader. She eventually said this was so much easier than regular books and so much lighter. So glad I gave it to her.
Chrysta Lopez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this. Love the color so much I don’t want to buy a case. The screen texture feels better than my last one and the battery life is twice as long. It’s a tad smaller than my last one so I should buy a case to protect it since last one didn’t fit so keep that in mind if you’re trading it in.
Matt Mund.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good. I upgraded from a Gen 5 Kindle. I miss the page turning buttons, but all of the other features make up for it. Big asterisk though... I paid around 40$ because it was on prime day sale + I traded in my kindle. I would be TERRIFIED of anyone paying $130 for this. Get it only while on sale."
Janet L. Caputo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to press and hold the kindle to get it to turn off. Tried to turn it on again and it worked fine, but I am concerned the kindle will do the same thing again. I'm going to charge it again and see how it acts. Prior Kindles never malfunctioned like this! Plan to request an exchange if this continues."
Mike M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I traded in my 2015 Kindle. I take it everywhere so the water resistance is a plus. I like the flush screen. Not sure if I’ll have much use for the Audible ability but it’s an option. I chose the 8GB capacity because it gives me more than enough. I don’t use my Kindle for magazines and other periodicals. I do have several multi-vilume ‘collected works’ and I have more than enough space. Kindles aren’t flashy but they can’t be beat for reliability.
Brenda Troisi,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is a learning process for me as this one is quite different from my old one. I could give a much better opinion after another few months. I am only on my second book and am continuing to learn and adjust. I do like how light it is and how much clearer the print is.
Rumour24,5.0 out of 5 stars,I upgraded from the 6th generation. Love love love the paperwhite! The screen is the best. Much more comfortable for me than a backlit screen. I read A LOT and this makes it so easy. Lightweight and comfortable to hold. The storage space is amazing and the menus are easy to navigate. Highly recommended!
Kenn Brody,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Long, long battery life, clear text, almost inexhaustible storage, and I don't have to worry about it getting wet. This is my 4th Kindle, and the only Gen 10 issue.
Good luck getting it to pair with Airphones for audiobooks, though. The instructions don't cover getting the Airphones into pairing mode..."
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very disappointed to see the on/off button was moved to the bottom. Silly, since most people hold the book from the bottom, it's very easy to hit the button causing it to turn off. Very annoying.
Otherwise happy I can read it in daylight and in the pool."
Ms. Understood,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I get a lot of free books from the public library delivered onto my Kindle. I had a very old model before which had awkward buttons. I barely used it, but I use this one all the time. I like that it swipes left and right from the screen to turn the pages. It also holds a good charge. I can read for many hours before I have to put it on the charger again."
Chubbywatta,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this as a Christmas present to replace my old Kindle that didn't have a light. I am loving the lighted screen, it's so much easier on my eyes! I was also given the case that wakes the Kindle when opened and to sleep when closed, so I am enjoying that feature as well."
SLD,3.0 out of 5 stars,I love to read in the spa. I have never immerse it but the screen is always freezing up if any little drop of water from my fingers or condensation gets on it. I spend more time turning it on and off to unfreeze it than I do reading. My old paperwhite in a zip lock bag or my waterproof nook work much better. It's an ok reader otherwise.
Donald,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I went on a trip with the Kindle in the middle of my carry on bag, returned home and found the screen cracked in multiple places and the battery dead and unresponsive. It was gate checked for one leg of my trip. Fortunately, Amazon examined and replaced it. Now it’s my favorite way to read."
chantel.bischof,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best thing ever for an avid reader! Bought this actually due to Covid shutting down the local library and now I am hooked! Love the lights, battery, everything! Definitely worth it!"
MM,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I opted to save the $20 and got the software with ads. I expected it to be like my older kindle with ads when first opened and then nothing. But this new one has ads all over the first page. It was confusing to figure out how to navigate to my library and I kept getting taken to ads for other books if I touched the wrong part of the page.
Otherwise the kindle is fine and 5 stars."
J. Berg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love my Paperwhite! It's my first Kindle, so I can't compare it to older versions. The battery seems to last pretty long for me. I have logged many hours of reading with the brightness consistently on 7 and I still have about 65% battery left. Not much else to say. Great product that is very portable and encourages me to read more!"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the functionality of this device. Ive owned other e readers and this one is my fave. Only thing that bugs me is the lag on page turns at times and sometimes if i hit it just right qhen tuening the page it skips a ton of pages and i have a hard time getting back to where i was
clisbee,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The New Paperwhite is a step down from the Kindle Oasis in my opinion. I wasn't expecting that after all the kindle lifeforms Amazon would be going backwards.
The selling pages for the Paperwhite should put an emphasis on the old screen size.
Yes if I read in more detail I would have ordered a second Oasis rather than getting the ""new"" Paperwhite."
Billie R. Grewing,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great battery life, 2 weeks or more, fast downloads and small and convenient to travel with."
Kathleen A. Mcmullen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Before I purchased I checked the reviews and that helped me to want to order one. I'm so happy with it. It's all and even more then was commented on it. The lighting is great and the battery life last for a few weeks. You wouldn't be disappointed. Love everything about it.
Koki,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just received this to replace my old one. It is smaller and the print seems easier to read. So far this is a good upgrade for me. I read a lot in the bathtub and by the swimming pool so being waterproof will be a big improvement for me.
JMagColorado,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just got back from a vacation in Cabo and read three books on my new Kindle Paperwhite. Fearlessly took it out on floats to read while staying cool on the water. No issues at all reading in bright sunlight. Glad I traded in my old Kindle for this one.
Walker,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loving my new Kindle - first time I went with paper white and I love that I can reverse the font and background color for no eye strain while reading in the dark. It’s super thin and light and easy to hold on one hand and travels great!
REX LANYI,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the new Kindle because I believed that the type resolution was superior. What I found was that it was only marginally better than my Kindle Fire, which does a lot of other things. Most importantly, I am much more comfortable looking at an 8"" screen for reading, as opposed to a 6"" screen. It just didn't live up to the hype."
Patricia Geraghty,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the light and being able to read in bed with no lights on. My only complaint is that it is very confusing trying to get books that I had downloaded and ones that are just there and I am not sure why. I think it's more of a recommendation. But, I'd rather have an easier way to find my already downloaded book. I don't think my old ones carried over to the new kindle when it was turned on."
Z,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely hate the flickering from refreshing. The screen is not easy on the eyes and feels like you're looking through a distorting ""film"". I'm hoping to find the utility in sitting poolside but for now this has been a rare disappointment from Amazon."
John M. Amberg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I took the plunge today and read my Kindle in a hot tub, the only thing better was to have a glass of wine( i did not).
While I did not dunk it, it worked great. I have few readers and this is becoming my favorite. As with all things digital you can not sell them at a book swap. Maybe some day."
Alice 41,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the first Kindle I have ever had and it is highly satisfactory in every way. I haven't had it that long but the battery life seems to be good. I do use it in airplane mode as I heard that prolongs the battery life I have no complaints with any feature of it and would highly recommend it. The the special offers feature creates no problem at all for me. It is a non-issue.
Anita Kulp,5.0 out of 5 stars,My earlier series Kindle Paperweight was beginning to have some battery problems. So when Amazon Prime Days arrived I thought good time to trade up. And I am so glad I did. This new Kindle Paperweight is lightweight and very responsive touch screen. I love it!
Caren,5.0 out of 5 stars,All of my reading material is on Kindle. I have had two of them since Kindle's inception. The Paperwhite is great. It's very light weight which surprised me. The others were heavier. Paperwhite is smaller which is nice for reading in bed as well as taking it along to appointments that could require a wait - reading time!
Jean,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd kindle & I love it! Extremely lightweight, and great reading day or night. Transferred all my library very easily. I read every day of the year."
Witchywoman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like how adaptable the light is, it keeps eye fatigue down no matter the light. I also really like that it’s light weight
I do however, have one issue, there’s not a great place to hold it. It’s quite easy to accidentally turn off"
steadyreader47,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this as a gift for a family member. It's compact and easily navigated. There are some differences between this and previous generations of the paperwhite., it's a little smaller and I found the initial setup and download much easier."
e,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The back lighting is decent but it doesnt fully prevent my eye strain. Theres a slight delay using the touch screen, like its slow which bothers me but what i HATE is that the POWER button is in the WORST place POSsible!!!! Right on the center bottom and every time i shift my kindle it switches off. Pain in the ass. Excellent battery life tho. Overall, little annoyances make me prefer kindle app on my phone."
OZ GENC,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unusable due to pairing issues with our all available AirPods at home. It takes 20-30 times trials to make it work to pair and even that is sometimes not successful. There is no alternative to use with a regular cable thus the kindle essentially become obsolete. I wrote to amazon to replace it and waiting for a response.
FireWitch1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Kindle no issues screen quality is great back lighting is perfect. Downloads are quick and Wi-Fi connection is reliable. No issues with the power button as it is the same placement as the previous paperwhite that I bought in 2010.
Kenneth Neward,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is fantastic. I was convinced that I wouldn't want to give up holding a paper book but after one day, I'm sold. I love reading with this thing and I'm no longer hostage to whatever books happen to be in the airport bookstore."
Denise J,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the kindle but I don't like the on/off button on the bottom. I also think it's difficult for personalization of font and light. I think it should be much more convenient to reach and clearly stated where it's at on the window top.
Danny and Kim,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third Kindle. I have owned the original Kindle and the Kindle Fire. Out of the three of them I love this PaperWhite the best. I love the lighted screen, that it is light weight, and the fact that it is just a reading device and nothing else."
DivyAnkit,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's an excellent device for reading.
But it's not easy for someone coming with the expectations of smooth UI to adjust to it. It works for book reading, but for any other basic navigation, FPS is totally screwed up. You can't expect to surf, find and buy a book on it easily.
Also, the dictionary lookup can be improved with other sources such as Wiktionary and 3rd party providers like freedictionary.
The UI doesn't have the same list of content management options as available on browser, I couldn't delete a borrowed book, etc."
Kari | Books For The Living,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great upgrade from my old one, which was a hand-me-down. I like that the built in light is easy to adjust and it’s lightweight to hold. The touchscreen is sometimes a bit slow to respond but perhaps that’s just the nature of the device."
Kindle Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My 10th generation Paperwhite has stopped holding a charge. It goes from 100% to less than 10% in 1 day. I'm writing this because after. a half hour of searching I can't find any way to contact Amazon support (if there actually is such a thing) to get the problem fixed. I don't want to talk to the ""Community"" or look at stupid ""suggestions"". Restarting it has no effect whatsoever. Why the h don't you have an easily accessed way to contact customer support for your Kindle devices? I NEED HELP!"
Michael Beers,1.0 out of 5 stars,Well you have to be able to use the product in order to enjoy it. Ordered the first one on prime day got it was a dud had to return it for a replacement. Replacement arrives same issues worked with Amazon tec support both times both devices defective. I have had better luck with my the kindel app my phone then this price of ****. Do your self a favor download the app on your phone and save your self some money.
AccurateCritic,3.0 out of 5 stars,Had the Kindle Paperwhite for a short while. My main issue with it is that it's the only phone/tablet-like device I own that does not have wireless charging. I've ordered a QI Receiver (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0785ST823/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to try to add that capability. I'll know next week how well that does or does not work.
Taylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great upgrade since I had a 2nd generation Kindle paperwhite. I was a little worried the light would make it like other tablets, but somehow it still looks just like paper. It's just as convenient and I like all the adjustable settings for brightness and text size"
ALB,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like that it is compact and not heavy. Easy to use and easy to download books. I had been using my iPad and the battery quickly drained when reading a book. Some of the reviews state the battery lasts 3 weeks but I find it only lasts 1 week. The reason I bought it was due to the battery life. I did turn down the brightness and this helped some. Otherwise this is nice and handy to read.
NAS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very convenient and lightweight, easy to use. I was very unhappy with the fact that the day after I received it the price dropped $30 and the only choice I was given was to return it and reorder at the lower price. I happened to be on vacation so that was not an option. Took a lot of the enjoyment out of it!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wasn't sure if I'd like an e-reader since I really do like the feel of holding a book and turning the actual pages as I read. But Kindle has converted me and I love it and can't believe I held out so long in getting one. Love everything about it!
John and Laura Miller,5.0 out of 5 stars,"for the the paper white works in the dark or works in bright light. A big advantage over a book. Have just had it a few weeks. The only problem so far is turning on after being off. sometimes it turns on, but refuses to respond to a swipe, which is the normal way to return it to showing content."
Robin,4.0 out of 5 stars,What I don’t like is when I’m reading along and ads come on trying to sell me “other” books. Sometimes over and over.. I would like to choose when to see ads for new items. That feature is driving me crazy. I like how small it is. It can pop into my purse and I can take with me wherever I want to go.
ATLbuckeye,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this to replace an old Kindle with the keyboard at bottom. It is much smaller than I am used to but the screen is the same size. Like the touch screen better than the buttons on the old o e. Built in light easily adjusts and makes reading at night or in a dark plane much better. Very happy with it.
mef1018,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
Size
battery life
reading light
weight
ease of use

Cons:
I feel like screen/page transitions are so jumpy and have such a dated feeling.
I also feel like it is very slow to wake up some times
special offers are annoying (thankfully you can buy your way out of them)"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I truly love this kindle I have thought I would like one for years but never got one until now. So easy to use and download books I love. Can read in bed without a light on. Was a little disappointed it didn't come with a generic cover
